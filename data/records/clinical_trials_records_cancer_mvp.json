Interventions: Pentoxifylline (DRUG); Placebo (OTHER). Sponsor: Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, India. Summary: The triad of liver disease, arterial hypoxia, and extensive pulmonary vascular dilatation is known as the hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). The prevalence of this syndrome ranges from 10% to 30% in people with chronic liver disease.\n\nThe exact cause of HPS is unknown. Previous research has shown that eicosanoids function as vasoconstrictors and cause an increase in the number of intravascular macrophage-like cells. Cirrhosis has been linked to increased NO generation in the lungs, which has been linked to intrapulmonary venous dilation. Increased pulmonary NO production is attributed to increased expression of pulmonary vascular endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and inducible NO synthase.\n\nIncreased hepatic synthesis and release of low levels of endothelin 1 (ET-1) has been established in recent investigations to function as a trigger for increasing eNO levels. TNF (tumor necrosis factor) and ET-1 have both been linked to the onset of experimental HPS. Increased CO generation and heme oxygenase expression have been linked to the progression of HPS in recent investigations. HPS increases mortality in cirrhotic patients and may affect the frequency and severity of portal hypertension consequences.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge there have been only three pilot studies in humans which checked the effect of pentoxifylline in hepatopulmonary syndrome and they showed highly contrasting results. The outcome was also measured in a short interval. Investigator hypothesize that pentoxifylline would improve the oxygenation in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome",

Interventions: Chemotherapy (DRUG); Cell infusion (BIOLOGICAL). Sponsor: UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Summary: Despite the progress in the therapy, Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) remains fatal for more than 15% of patients. Even in patients who are cured, the morbidity of therapy is substantial and long-lasting. New therapeutic agents are required therefore not only to further reduce mortality but also to alleviate morbidity.\n\nThe majority of HL express the CD30 antigens. CD30 expression is routinely used for the diagnosis of HL. Preclinical observations support CD30 as a viable target of CAR-T therapy. This phase Ib/II study was conducted based on these observations.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability of ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells in subjects with Hodgkin's Lymphoma and identify a recommended dose for further.\n\nThis is a single-center, open-label phase Ib/II trial that uses a 3+3 design to identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells in Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The phase II portion is designed to determine the PFS of ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 in Hodgkin's Lymphoma.\n\nSubjects will be enrolled on 1 of 3 dose levels as determined by a 3+3 design. Up to 25 evaluable subjects may then be enrolled in the phase II portion of the study. Subjects may have cells procured to manufacture the ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells if they meet eligibility for procurement. During the time period necessary to manufacture the ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells, Subjects will be allowed to receive standard-of-care bridging therapy at the discretion of their local oncologist. Prior to cell infusion, subjects will undergo additional eligibility evaluations, and then if eligible, will undergo lymphodepletion followed by cell infusion 2-14 days later. Subjects will then be followed for 15 years as is required for studies involving gene transfer experiments.",

Conditions: Locally Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma; PD-1. Interventions: DNA panel and RNA Sequencing (OTHER). Sponsor: Xijing Hospital. Summary: G/GEJ adenocarcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumors in China, ranking the fifth highest incidence and third highest mortality worldwide. Currently, surgical resection is the preferred treatment for G/GEJ adenocarcinoma, while the 5-year survival rate of patients is lower than 25%. Compared with surgical resection, immunotherapy is proved to be able to effectively prolong the survival time of patients. On one hand, with the continuous promotion of immunotherapy drugs, the exploration of neoadjuvant application of immunotherapy in G/GEJ adenocarcinoma has become a hotspot in recent years. It's also on their way that clinical trials of programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and other immune checkpoints are carried out. On the other hand, the research found that although the curative effect of immune therapy seems better, the present G/GEJ adenocarcinoma immunotherapy marker researches mainly focused on the late stage of the cancer, with few studies of immune markers of neoadjuvant therapy for G/GEJ adenocarcinoma. Additionally, it's not quite feasible for single biomarkers to predict the immune treatment effect precisely. Therefore, combined with clinicopathology and therapeutic effects, this study is aimed to construct the efficacy prediction model of anti-PD-1 antibody together with chemotherapy for G/GEJ adenocarcinoma, by detecting RNA expression. Furthermore, this study will perform drug sensitivity test and bio-molecular test on patient derived organoid model to validate the biomarkers found from biological specimens.",

Status: TERMINATED. Phase: NA. Conditions: Bladder Cancer. Interventions: Infection prophylaxis (OTHER). Sponsor: Hopital Foch. Summary: Total prostatic cystectomy with enterocystoplasty is the most extensive urological surgical procedure and one with the highest complication rate, especially infectious complication. The mortality rate remains substantial (2 to 5%).\n\nExamination of hundreds of TPCs made every year in the Urology Department of Foch Hospital, shows that nosocomial urinary infection is constant, especially when the TPC is followed by the constitution of an ileal bladder replacement.\n\nThis is due to the intervention itself and duration of postoperative urinary cath\u00e9ters (ureteral and bladder). This leads to increase surveillance and antibiotic treatment, given the risks of declared infection in this context.\n\nDetailed analysis of the last 20 TPCs with enterocystoplasty showed the presence of germs in significant numbers, in all cases.\n\nUrell\u00ae (also sold under the Trademark Ellura\u00ae) contains a cranberry juice extract with a high content of bioactive, soluble Proanthocyanidins (PACs) . The daily dose is 36 mg total PACs measured by the DMAC/A2 method. The PACs prevent uropathogenic E.col bacteria from adhering to uroepithelial cells . Their long term use does not create any resistance of the bacteria.\n\nThe excellent prophylactic effet of Urell\u00ae had been previously observed in the same Center under different conditions.\n\nTherefore a further demonstration was justified, of the prophylactic efficacy of Urell\u00ae in the perioperative setting of total prostato-cystectomy with substitute enterocytoplasty, where the slightest urinary infection, symptomatic or not, prolongs hospitalization and requires antibiotic treatment because of its harmful and sometimes major consequences.",

Status: COMPLETED. Phase: PHASE3. Conditions: Differentiated Thyroid Cancer. Interventions: Thyrogen (thyrotropin alfa for injection) (DRUG). Sponsor: Genzyme, a Sanofi Company. Summary: Patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer are commonly treated with surgery to remove their thyroid gland followed by radioiodine ablation to destroy any remaining parts of the thyroid gland that may have been missed during surgery. It is thought that ablation with radioiodine destroys normal remaining thyroid tissue as well as cancerous cells either in the thyroid area or at other sites.\n\nFollowing successful treatment, patients are then monitored by their physicians at regular intervals with testing to detect any recurrence of thyroid cancer throughout the body. If thyroid cells are detected by these follow up tests, the physician will decide the best method to re-treat the patient.\n\nIn 2001-2003 Genzyme conducted a clinical study to test if Thyrogen\u00ae can be used to accomplish radioiodine ablation treatment. This study aimed to determine that the success rates of radioiodine ablation were comparable when patients were prepared for ablation with Thyrogen\u00ae while being maintained on their normal thyroid hormone therapy, or, alternatively, by thyroid hormone withdrawal. Thyroid hormone withdrawal commonly causes uncomfortable side effects for patients, and these might be avoided by the use of Thyrogen.\n\nEight months after the initial Thyrogen plus radioiodine treatment to achieve ablation, all patients in both groups were given Thyrogen\u00ae to test for any remaining thyroid tissue. The results of this testing showed that all patients (in both groups) had successfully achieved remnant ablation and had no detectable thyroid tissue remaining.\n\nIn order to confirm these remnant ablation results we will conduct follow up testing in this study for all patients that were enrolled in the previous study and we also will determine if their thyroid cancer has recurred. Only patients who completed this previous Thyrogen ablation study are eligible for entry into this study.",

The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 agents has significantly ameliorated CD management. Infliximab (IFX) is the first anti-TNF-\u03b1 agent registered for pediatric CD. The current dosing recommendation of IFX is extrapolated from adult studies, and it is a weight-based dose (5 mg/kg) delivered during induction (infusion at weeks 0, 2, and 6) and maintenance (every 8 weeks). However, pediatric patients have a 25-40% lower drug exposure compared to adults, particularly children under 10 years of age, resulting in diminished efficacy and an increased risk of developing a complicated disease course. The investigators hypothesize that an intensified IFX induction scheme (instead of the current dosing recommendation) is more effective in the treatment of pediatric CD patients.\n\nObjective: The primary study objective of our study is to assess the efficacy of an IFX intensified induction scheme vs. a standard dosing schedule in improving drug exposure without treatment escalation in pediatric CD patients. Secondary objectives are clinical and biochemical remission without treatment escalation, development of antibodies to IFX (ATI) and adverse reactions.\n\nStudy design: An international, multicenter, prospective, open-label trial. Study population: Anti-TNF-\u03b1 na\u00efve children (age 1-15 years) with CD and an indication to start IFX treatment.\n\nIntervention: IFX will be given intravenously at 10 mg/kg at week 0, and 5 mg/kg at weeks 2, 4, and 8 to all patients (induction). Maintenance will start at week 12, and then ideally continue every 6 weeks till week 24 (end of study). IFX trough levels will be measured at weeks 4, 12, and 24. During the maintenance, the IFX dose and/or interval adjustments, the IFX discontinuation or the start of a co-medication (i.e., an immunomodulator) will be possible on indication (i.e., primary nonresponse, secondary loss of response, intolerance to study medication) at the physicians' discretion. Follow-up will continue for the duration of the study (week 24).\n\nMain endpoint: Proportion of patients with IFX TL \u2265 5 \u00b5g/mL at week 12 without treatment escalation.",

Conditions: Leukemia; Hematopoetic Stem Cell Transplantation; Donor Lymphocyte Infusion; CAR T-Cell Therapy; Lymphoma; Cell Therapy. Interventions: Exercise (BEHAVIORAL); Isoproterenol (DRUG); Placebo (DRUG); Bisoprolol Fumarate Tablet 10 mg (DRUG); Nadolol (1 x 80 mg) Tablets (Invamed, Inc) (DRUG); Carvedilol 50 mg (DRUG); Roflumilast 500 Mcg Oral Tablet (DRUG). Sponsor: University of Arizona. Summary: This study aims to improve the treatment of blood cancer by using exercise to collect healthier immune cells from donors. Allogeneic adoptive cell therapy is a treatment where immune cells from a healthy donor are given to a cancer patient, usually to help prevent or treat cancer relapse after a stem cell transplant. These donor cells can either be directly infused into the patient or grown in a lab to create more specialized immune cells that target and kill cancer. While this therapy has been helpful for many patients, there is a need to make it more effective for a larger group and reduce side effects like graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), where the donor's immune cells attack the patient's healthy tissue.\n\nThis Early Phase 1 trial will test whether exercise can help produce better immune cells from donors. The investigators will recruit healthy participants for three study groups:\n\n1. Exercise Group: Participants will complete a 20-minute cycling exercise session. The investigators will collect blood samples before, during, and after exercise to study the number and quality of immune cells. The investigators will also use the collected cells to create immune therapies and test their ability to kill cancer cells in the lab and control cancer growth in mice.\n2. Exercise and Beta Blocker Group: In this group, participants will complete up to five cycling sessions, with at least a week between each session. Before each session, participants will take either a placebo or a drug (beta blocker) that blocks stress hormones like adrenaline. The investigators will collect blood samples before and during exercise to see how blocking these hormones changes the effect of exercise on immune cells.\n3. Isoproterenol Group: Participants in this group will receive a 20-minute infusion of isoproterenol, a drug that mimics the effects of adrenaline. The investigators will collect blood samples before, during, and after the infusion to see if the drug causes similar immune changes to those caused by exercise.\n\nParticipants can join one, two, or all three groups. This research will help understand whether exercise can improve immune cell therapies for treating blood cancer and reduce the risk of GvHD, making these treatments safer and more effective.",

Summary: RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread by blocking blood flow. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known if chemotherapy is more effective with or without radiofrequency ablation in treating liver metastases.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying combination chemotherapy, bevacizumab, and radiofrequency ablation to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab alone in treating unresectable liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.",

Status: COMPLETED. Phase: PHASE1. Conditions: Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer. Interventions: SOM230 (DRUG). Sponsor: Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Summary: After failure of initial ADT, addition of an anti-androgen is established to treat castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Substitution of the first anti-androgen and anti-androgen withdrawal results in treatment responses in 25-40% of patients for 4-6 months. A more effective second line treatment after failure of first ADT could prolong the time until the state of symptomatic HRPC, which is currently treated with docetaxel and accompanied by significant side effects. Since the importance of the IGF-signaling in PC is not only indicated by preclinical results but also by clinical efficacy of somatostatin analogs, further clinical research with the new somatostatin analog pasireotide is warranted.\n\nThis study is designed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pasireotide LAR in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). It also aims for a preliminary efficacy evaluation of pasireotide within the dose expansion part at the MTD. Preliminary efficacy will be assessed by evaluation of different measures of prostate cancer e.g. changes in PSA, disease control rate (RECIST 1.1), symptoms and changes of biomarkers linked to the mode of action of pasireotide LAR. The study will also explore characteristics of patients who might benefit most from this treatment approach",

With the introduction of new targeted agents, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the identification of EGFR mutations, lung cancer management has markedly changed in recent years. However, these new agents are costly and their payment is restricted in certain situations defined National Insurance Agency. Therefore, using databases from National Insurance Agency might not be able to reflect the exact impact on pharmacoeconomics. In this study, the investigators will analyze the data from a tertiary medical center, where all the costs including insurance reimbursement, co-payment, and payment not covered by insurance. The investigators will also compare with the investigators results with national database to analyze the cost benefit of these new agents on lung cancer.",

Conditions: Musculoskeletal Symptoms; Breast Cancer; Endocrine Therapy; Aromatase Inhibitors. Interventions: Motor rehabilitation based on ai visual recognition (OTHER). Sponsor: Fudan University. Summary: This study aims to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-based skeletal recognition system designed to support real-time, interactive rehabilitation exercise (RE programs. The goal is to mitigate musculoskeletal symptoms associated with endocrine therapy in breast cancer survivors.Endocrine therapy remains a cornerstone in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, typically extending over 5 to 10 years. While the therapeutic benefits of endocrine therapy are well established, agents such as aromatase inhibitors frequently induce musculoskeletal symptoms (MS), including joint pain, stiffness (particularly morning stiffness), carpal tunnel syndrome, tenosynovitis, myalgia, and muscle weakness. These symptoms, which may be continuous or intermittent, can affect both central (spine, hips, shoulders) and peripheral joints (elbows, wrists, knees, feet), severely compromising patients' quality of life (QoL). Although physical exercise has been demonstrated to alleviate these symptoms, adherence to adequate exercise regimens remains suboptimal among patients. Furthermore, there is no consensus on the optimal type, duration, or intensity of exercise interventions, and standardized protocols are lacking. Recognizing exercise as a long-term behavior, we are developing a home-based, AI-assisted rehabilitation program tailored to the specific needs of patients undergoing endocrine therapy.",

Summary: Addition of aprepitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist to a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone regimen was shown to be effective for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). Little is known about the efficacy of aprepitant when used without dexamethasone. Dexamethasone is widely used to prevent both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy. However, multi-period use of dexamethasone could be associated with side effect, such as hyperglycemia, dyspepsia and insomnia. This randomized phase III trial studies antiemetic therapy with aprepitant and tropisetron to see how well they work compared to dexamethasone plus tropisetron in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with colorectal cancer receiving FOLFOX(oxaliplatin, leuvovorin and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy.",

Conditions: Tumor of Bone; Chest Wall Tumor; Chest Wall Sarcoma; Sarcoma of Bone; Surgery; Implant Site Reaction. Interventions: Implants (DEVICE); Plates (DEVICE). Sponsor: Blokhin's Russian Cancer Research Center. Summary: A patient with a tumor lesion of the chest wall undergoes CT scan with a step width of less than 1 mm, then engineers design an individual model to replace the defect. Using a 3D printer, a model is made based on titanium alloy powder. Preoperative preparation takes an average of 14-21 days. The next stage is surgical treatment in the amount of resection of the chest wall with plastic defect with an individual titanium implant. In some cases, the titanium framework is separated from the pleural cavity by a polytetrafluoroethylene plate in order to seal and prevent the development of pulmonary hernias. The advantages of titanium individual prostheses include accurate matching of the implant to the size and characteristics of the defect, individual modeling allows you to repeat the anatomical features of the patient. This method helps to recreate the original shape of the chest, and most importantly, symmetrical, relatively healthy half. With the help of titanium, individualized prostheses are made based on 3D modeling, which will reduce the incidence of complications, accelerate rehabilitation and improve the quality of life of patients with tumor lesions of the chest wall. The postoperative period takes 15-30 days.",

Conditions: Actinic Keratoses. Interventions: 5FU-Calcipotriol (DRUG); 5-FU 50 MG/ML Topical Cream (DRUG). Sponsor: Maastricht University Medical Center. Summary: 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) is proven to be the most effective therapy in field directed treatment for AK, with Jansen et al. reporting a 1-year probability of treatment success of 74.7%. However, treatment with 5FU is associated with side effects, like erythema, itching, a burning sensation and crusting, and a burdensome dosing regimen of twice daily application for four weeks. This long treatment duration in combination with side-effects and overall lifestyle adjustments during treatment can be the reason for poor adherence and premature termination, and it can also lead to future refusal of 5FU therapy. Therefore, room for improvement lies in increasing the tolerability, in terms of side effects or treatment duration, while maintaining the efficacy of 5FU in the treatment of AK.\n\nAddition therapy, which can shorten the duration of treatment, might be the key to success. Calcipotriol (CAL) enhances thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelium-derived cytokine, which promotes antitumor immunity. Therefore, it is known to have a synergistic effect when combined with 5FU in the treatment of AK. This suggests that short-term treatment with 5FU-CAL is effective and provides the opportunity to shorten duration of treatment, thereby improving tolerability of treatment and full adherence to the treatment regimen.\n\nHowever, no study compared 5FU-CAL combination therapy with standard 5FU treatment for a duration of 28 days. This study aims to evaluate whether a short course of combination therapy with 5FU-CAL is non-inferior to a full course of 5FU monotherapy with respect to the 1-year probability of treatment success.",

Interventions: Liposome Entrapped Docetaxel (LE-DT) (DRUG). Sponsor: INSYS Therapeutics Inc. Summary: LE-DT is a novel, proprietary delivery system of docetaxel developed by NeoPharm, Inc. Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere) is an anti-microtubular network agent and is one of the most active agents in the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and other variety of cancers. Taxotere has poor solubility and is designed to be administered with Tween 80 in ethanol. This vehicle causes acute hypersensitivity reaction. By removing toxic detergent used in Taxotere, the form of LE-DT, shows reduced toxicity and comparable therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical study. The clinical evidence obtained from the NeoPharm Phase I study shows fewer side effects and possibly administered at higher dose to induce greater effectiveness of LE-DT. The current Phase II study is designed to accomplish the following objectives:\n\n1. Assess the antitumor effect indicator serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) following the intravenous (IV) administration of 110 mg/m2 LE-DT every three weeks in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer\n2. To evaluate the measurable soft tissue disease response using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumor (RECIST) methodology\n3. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)\n4. To correlate PSA expression with tumor response\n5. To evaluate the safety of LE-DT at 110 mg/m2 level, in particular peripheral neuropathy, water retention as well as myelotoxicity\n6. To evaluate the quality of life (QOL)",

Conditions: Lung Neoplasms; Pneumothorax. Interventions: HFNO (DEVICE). Sponsor: Shenzhen Second People's Hospital. Summary: With the continuous strengthening of the concept of rapid rehabilitation, great progress has been made in minimally invasive thoracic surgery, and thoracoscopic surgery has developed rapidly. Double-lumen endotracheal(DLT) intubation is still the most reliable way of intubation in lung surgery. However, hypoxemia faced during double-lumen intubation still threatens the perioperative safety of thoracic surgery patients. In recent years, high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) has great potential in the field of anesthesia, especially playing a new and important role in the prevention and treatment of short-term hypoxia and life-threatening airway emergencies. However, the use of HFNO in pulmonary surgery patients with poor pulmonary function lacks evidence-based basis, and there are few reliable clinical data.\n\nThis study adopted a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind design. A total of 100 patients aged 18-60 years who underwent elective thoracoscopy-assisted pulmonary surgery were included and randomly divided into the experimental group: HFNO was used in the process of double-lumen intubation asphyxia; the control group: according to the traditional intubation process, No oxygen therapy equipment was used during intubation asphyxiation. The lowest blood oxygen saturation during intubation, the incidence of hypoxemia during intubation, perioperative complications, and postoperative hospital stay were compared between the two groups.\n\nThis study explores the advantages of HFNO in complex endotracheal intubation, assuming that HFNO can improve the oxygen saturation of double-lumen intubation; optimize the intubation method of DLT, and tap its new potential to prevent and manage emergency airway crisis.",

Interventions: BLZ-100 (DRUG). Sponsor: Blaze Bioscience Inc.. Summary: Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue, and failure to surgically remove a cancer-affected lymph node or residual cancer at the surgical margin reduces a patient's chance of survival. Moreover, damage to adjacent normal tissue during surgery can result in significant morbidity. The investigators hypothesize that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges of the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in real-time as they operate. This is a safety study to assess the safety of BLZ-100 in patients with soft tissue sarcoma undergoing surgery.",

Summary: This is an observational study in which only observations from routine clinical practices will be made. Participants will not receive any advice on treatment or any changes to healthcare as a part of the study.\n\nIn this study, medical records data of Belgian men with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) who had received or are receiving treatment with darolutamide in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel will be studied.\n\nmHSPC is a cancer of the prostate gland, a male reproductive gland found below the bladder. Metastatic means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Hormone-sensitive means it can be treated with hormone-therapy such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).\n\nADT lowers the level of androgens, male hormones, and slows down the growth of cancer cells. However, in some cases, ADT alone is not sufficient for the treatment of mHSPC and doctors recommend a combination of treatments.\n\nThe study drug darolutamide, in combination with ADT and docetaxel is an approved treatment for mHSPC. Darolutamide aims to work by blocking the androgens signals to slow the growth of the cancer cells. Docetaxel is a medicine used to treat different types of cancer and works by stopping the growth and spread of cancer cells.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn more about the real-world use of darolutamide in combination with ADT and docetaxel in Belgian men with mHSPC.\n\nTo do this, researchers will study the following information about participants who are already prescribed this combination treatment by their treating doctors in real-word condition:\n\n* Participants' cancer characteristics before starting the treatment, and\n* Participants' treatment history The data will be collected between July 2024 to September 2024, from eligible participants' medical records.\n\nStudy doctors will only look at the medical records of adult men with mHSPC in Belgium.\n\nIn this study, only available data from routine care will be collected.

Sponsor: National Cancer Institute (NCI). Summary: This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of pidnarulex in combination with trastuzumab deruxtecan in treating patients with breast cancer and other solid tumors that express varying levels of a protein called HER2 and that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic), that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), or that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced). Pidnarulex is an enzyme inhibitor that causes cell death and prevents tumor cell growth. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is in a class of medications called antibody-drug conjugates. It is composed of a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive tumor cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Giving pidnarulex in combination with trastuzumab deruxtecan may be safe, tolerable and/or effective in treating patients with metastatic, unresectable, or locally advanced HER2-expressing breast cancer or other solid tumors.",

Summary: Lymphomas are a group of cancers that originate in the lymphatic system, a key component of the immune system. They can be broadly categorized into two main types: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).\n\nThere are different subtypes of HL, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). The subtypes of cHL include nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte-rich, and lymphocyte-depleted.\n\nNon-Hodgkin lymphomas are more diverse and comprise a wide range of subtypes, each with distinct genetic, molecular, and clinical features. Common subtypes of NHL include Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Follicular lymphoma (FL), Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), myeloma, and other rarer subgroups.\n\nMany of these diseases typically present with lymph node enlargement, bone marrow infiltration, general and lymphoma subtype specific symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.\n\nNovel agents have improved the prognosis of high-risk lymphoma patients in the front-line and relapsed setting and more accurate prognostic tools enable less intensive treatment for low-risk patients, while maintaining their good prognosis.\n\nLymphoma disease have not been systematically assessed in Austria to date. This medical registry of the AGMT is thus the first Austrian-wide standardized documentation of epidemiology, clinical course and molecular and other biologic data of this disease. As lymphomas are a very heterogeneous group, not all subtypes will always be documented simultaneously in this registry. Which lymphoma subtype is to be documented can change over time, depending on which clinical question is currently in focus.",

Summary: This clinical trial is a Phase II study investigating the effectiveness and safety of a three-drug combination-Zeprumetostat, Azacitidine, and Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome-in adults with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). PTCL is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has limited treatment options after the first line of therapy.\n\nThe study aims to enroll approximately 26 patients at a single center in China. Eligible participants will receive up to 6 cycles of induction therapy with all three drugs, followed by up to 2 years of maintenance therapy with Zeprumetostat alone if they respond to treatment.\n\nThe main goal is to evaluate the overall response rate (how many patients experience tumor shrinkage). Secondary goals include assessing how long patients live without their disease getting worse, how long they survive overall, and the safety profile of this treatment combination. The study will also explore whether specific genetic markers or viral infections are linked to how well patients respond.\n\nThis study is important because it tests a novel, potentially less toxic, and more effective combination for a patient population with high unmet medical need. All participants will be closely monitored for treatment response and side effects throughout the trial.",

Conditions: Ovarian Cancer. Sponsor: Assiut University. Summary: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the second commonest gynecological cancer with an overall incidence of 1.4% , associated with high mortality rate , There are three major types of ovarian cancers: epithelial ovarian carcinomas, germ cell tumors, and stromal cell tumors .\n\nOvarian cancer directly affects fertility, as treatment consists of surgical removal of the reproductive system and/or exposure to gonadotoxic agents. However, patients in early stages who meet established criteria can be treated with fertility-sparing surgeries and reach equivalent oncological results to those of traditional treatments. Fertility preservation techniques such as cryopreservation of oocytes, embryos and ovarian tissue may also be offered in some situations.\n\nOvarian cancer (OC) has a high mortality rate and usually presents late in advanced stage, which poses challenges to management. Better understanding of the disease biology and application of radical surgery (RS) to achieve no visible residual tumor, alongside with chemotherapy, may lead to longer survival amongst these patients. Our purpose is to find out the fertility and survival rates of women with Overian Cancer in reproductive women who underwent surgical intervention. Radical Surgery for Overian cancer is one of the most challenging procedures in gynecologic oncology surgery.",

Summary: Background:\n\nSatraplatin is an experimental drug that may be of benefit to patients with prostate cancer.\n\nPrednisone is approved for treating prostate cancer.\n\nThe gene excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 1 (ERCC1) helps repair cell damage caused by satraplatin. It is possible that patients who have a variant of this gene will not benefit from treatment with satraplatin because the drug will not be able to damage the cancer cells effectively.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo determine if satraplatin may help treat prostate cancer in patients with certain variants of the ERCC1 gene.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer whose disease has not responded to hormonal therapy or at least one type of chemotherapy and whose x-rays, scans or other tests have shown their cancer to be spreading.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants have a blood test to determine if they have a variant of the ERCC1 gene.\n\nParticipants take satraplatin by mouth every day for 5 consecutive days out of every 35 days and prednisone by mouth every day. These 35-day treatment cycles may continue for 6 months or longer, depending on the benefits and side effects of the treatment.\n\nDuring the treatment period, patients undergo the following tests and procedures:\n\n* Blood tests on days 1 of the treatment cycle.\n* Weekly blood draws for the first 3 treatment cycles.\n* Imaging studies (e.g., bone scans, computed tomography (CT) scans) every two cycles to determine the response to treatment.\n* Surgical or medical suppression of testosterone in patients whose cancer cells continue to grow due to exposure to the hormone....",

From the same donor, we will also make CAR T-cells, which are leukemia fighting cells, which will be given to the patient via an infusion into the vein after the transplanted stem cells have started to grow healthy blood cells. The modification of the stem cell transplant means that the healthy bone marrow cells will be \"invisible\" to the CAR T-cells that are trying to kill the leukemia cells.",

Summary: This phase II trial studies how well temsirolimus and bevacizumab work in treating patients with advanced endometrial, ovarian, liver, carcinoid, or islet cell cancer. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving temsirolimus together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.",

Giving sintilimab, carboplatin, and nab-paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.",

PET/CT uses a radioactive glutamate (one of the common building blocks of protein) called 18F-FSPG which may be able to recognize differences between tumor and healthy tissue. Since tumor cells are growing, they need to make protein, and other building blocks, for cell growth that are made from glutamate and other molecules. PET/CT using a radioactive glutamate may be a more effective method of diagnosing lung cancer than the standard PET/CT using a radioactive glucose (sugar), such as 18F-FDG.",

Summary: A teachable moment (TM) refers to life events or transitions, such as physician visits, early detection screening feedback, pregnancy, and hospitalization for, and diagnosis of, disease, that inspire health behavior change. Despite strong intuitive appeal of the TM concept and over 150 studies of interventions implemented in a TM, there has been little investigation of the influence of TMs for smoking, particularly for promoting smoking cessation among those indirectly affected by a TM (e.g., relatives of cancer patients). This prospective observational study using a matched-group design will assess whether a lung cancer diagnosis increases enrollment in a smoking cessation program and cessation, and reduces smoking, among the patient's relatives/spouse who smoke. We will compare enrollment in a cessation program and cessation and smoking rates in 2 groups of smokers: 1) relatives/spouses of newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients, and 2) relatives/spouses of patients with an orthopedic condition. We will also explore mediators and moderators of a lung cancer diagnosis as a TM. This study could clarify the TM concept for smoking cessation, shed light on the underlying mechanisms of TMs, and guide future development and implementation of TM-based smoking cessation interventions.",

Conditions: Prostate Cancer XXX. Interventions: Transcuten Electriacal Nerve Stimulation (OTHER). Sponsor: Cukurova University. Summary: Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of malignancy in men. Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Prostate Biopsy (TRUSG-PBx) is considered the gold standard method. The present, Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy is considered the gold standard method in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. During the process, patients experience severe discomfort and pain, although anesthetics and analgesics are used. In addition to pharmacological methods, non-pharmacological methods are also used in the control of pain caused by diagnosis and treatment interventions. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is among the non-pharmacological methods and it is the most widely used electroanalgesia method. In this randomized controlled intervention research, the effect of TENS application will be evaluated on pain, complications and comfort level during and after the procedure in patients who underwent Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Biopsy. Thanks to this research, it is thought that the pain level and complications will decrease and the comfort level will increase in patients who undergo TENS application.\n\nThe research will be carried out in \u00c7ukurova University Faculty of Medicine Balcal\u0131 Application and Research Hospital Urology Outpatient Clinic. The sample of the research will create volunteer patients, providing research criteria and made prostate biopsy in Urology Outpatient Clinic. Patients consisting of 2 groups as control and experimental (TENS applied) will be determined by randomization. In the power analysis calculated with statistical support, confidence interval of 95%, alpha value 0.05, beta value calculated with 80% power, a total of 80 patients will be included in the control and experimental group, including 40 patients each. The data will be collected by \"Personal Information Form\", \"Pain Assessment Form\", \"TRUSG-PBx Complication Follow-up Form\", \"Perianesthesia Comfort Scale Form\". The data obtained will be analyzed in SPSS (Statisticial Package for the Social Sciences) package program.\n\nIn this context, our research, a comparison will be made by evaluating the effect of TENS application on pain, complications and comfort, in patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. These results, non-pharmacological methods will make great contributions to improving patient outcomes in diagnostic interventions.\n\nKeywords: Pain, Nurse, Comfort, Prostate Biopsy and Complications, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS).",

Interventions: Surgicel\u00ae absorbable Haemostat (DEVICE). Sponsor: Fudan University. Summary: Hepatectomy is one of the best treatments for malignant or benign lesions of the liver. The mortality and morbidity rates after hepatectomy have declined in recent years because of the precise measurement of liver functional reserve, a better understanding of liver anatomy, meticulous haemostasis during operation and improved postoperative management. Although surgical techniques have improved, life-threatening complications, such as intra-abdominal bleeding, bile leakage and subphrenic infection, now cannot be completed avoided. The local complications were most associated with the liver section treatment during the operation. Hence, the need for safer and more effective hemostatic treatment than the conventional approaches, such as intraoperative pressure by surgical gauze, ligatures, and electrocoagulation by mono- or bipolar instruments.\n\nSurgicel\u00ae absorbable Haemostat is a sterile absorbable knitted fabric prepared by the controlled oxidation of regenerated cellulose. After Surgicel\u00ae has been saturated with blood, it swells into a brownish or black gelatinous mass which aids in the formation of a clot, thereby serving as a haemostatic adjunct in the control of local haemorrhage barriers on section.\n\nThe present randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Surgicel\u00ae absorbable Haemostat covering the raw cut surface during the hepatectomy.",

Interventions: PEP-CMV vaccine (DRUG). Sponsor: Charlotte Lemech. Summary: In Australia, glioblastoma (GBM) has a higher annual fatality rate than a variety of other cancers, such as melanoma, bladder, and kidney tumors. While the 5-year survival rate for other cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer, has increased, there have been no notable advancements in GBM during the past ten years, and the incidence and mortality patterns have barely changed between 1982 and 2011. In particular, GBM poses a challenging therapeutic dilemma for patients and physicians due to its aggressive biology and resistance to available treatments. Recent studies showed that cytomegalovirus (CMV) is expressed in GBM tumors, making it a good target for immunotherapy trials. This phase I trial aims to determine the safety and tolerability of the PEP-CMV vaccine in patients with newly diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated GBM in combination with one cycle of adjuvant temozolomide.",

Summary: This phase II trial tests how well accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered once per day works in ensuring an acceptable breast appearance in patients with low risk, hormone responsive breast cancer. APBI uses precise radiation beams to kill cancerous cells in a smaller area of the breast (partial breast) instead of the whole breast or chest area as in standard therapy. Additionally, APBI is given in a shorter course of treatment than whole breast radiation therapy, over fewer days instead of several weeks, with a lower total dose of radiation. APBI is currently given every other business day for a total of 5 treatments with excellent results; however, a shorter treatment duration could have similar or even better results. Undergoing APBI every day on consecutive business days for 5 treatments may result in an improved breast appearance for patients with low risk hormone responsive breast cancer.",

Summary: Three-dimensional (3D) printing is increasingly used in surgery to help doctors plan and perform complex operations with greater accuracy. In this study, the investigators used 3D-printed jaw models to assist in rebuilding the lower jaw (mandible) after tumor removal, using bone taken from the lower leg in a procedure called a free fibular flap.\n\nThe investigators compared two types of 3D-printed mandibular guides. One used a complete model of the patient's healthy mandible to guide reconstruction, while the other rebuilt the jaw by dividing the leg bone into planned segments and fitting them precisely into the jaw defect. All 3D design and printing were performed in-house by the surgical team using free computer software.\n\nAfter surgery, the investigators evaluated facial symmetry using standardized photographs taken before surgery and three months afterward. Both techniques helped surgeons achieve good reconstruction results. However, the segmented model produced more consistent facial symmetry, while results from the whole-mandible model varied more between patients.\n\nOverall, this study shows that in-house 3D printing is a practical and affordable tool for jaw reconstruction surgery. Although both approaches were effective, segmented models may offer more reliable results. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and improve future patient care.",

Conditions: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Interventions: Placebo (DRUG); Metformin (DRUG). Sponsor: Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Summary: The polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrinopathy in reproductive age women. The pathophysiology of this syndrome remains unclear, but there are evidences that a decreased in insulin sensitivity may be related in this syndrome. There are studies that showed the action of factors on the sensitivity of the insulin receptor, such as melatonin. It is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, whose role is still uncertain in human reproduction, although many studies have found that it may relate sex hormone effect. Many patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may have hyperinsulinemia, and that pinealectomized rats determined hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, with reduced release of insulin in response to glucose. Therefore, it is supposed that blood levels of melatonin might correlate with the blood insulin concentration in patients with the syndrome. Moreover, the insulin sensitizing agents have been used in the treatment of patients with insulin resistance and PCOS, based on its main pathophysiological substrate which is the hyperinsulinemia. In fact, the metformin is the most used in the literature. However, there are few studies on the use of metformin in adolescents. The evidences of this drugs in this group of patients have showed good therapeutic response with few side effects. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of metformin on insulin resistance and levels of melatonin in adolescents with PCOS. It will be performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study with 90 adolescents with PCOS. It will be evaluated clinical and laboratory parameters (TSH, free T4, prolactin, FSH, LH, estradiol, total testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA-s, 17-OH progesterone, SHBG, free androgen index, index of HOMA-IR and QUICKI from fasting glucose and insulin, total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, creatinine, AST and ALT and creatinkinase, fibrinogen and PAI-1, and melatonin for 6 months of treatment.",

Patients will be injected intravenously with \\[18F\\]2-deoxyglucose and a PET scan conducted over 90 minutes. Examination of the role of PET scan in assessing the response of breast cancer to chemotherapy, especially in stage II and stage III patients, will be done. Up to three PET scans within one year may be performed. Findings by PET scan will be correlated both with those of concurrent imaging techniques (x-ray, CT scan, MRI, bone scan or mammogram), and with histologic, biochemical, and flow cytometric information on the tumor, and with findings in subsequent surgical specimens. Changes in tumor glucose metabolism with treatment will be assessed by PET imaging studies and by biochemical methods when possible.",

Interventions: Pomalidomide (DRUG); Dexamethasone (DRUG). Sponsor: Swiss Cancer Institute. Summary: Pomalidomide is an approved treatment for refractory multiple myeloma. Toxicity of pomalidomide in the pivotal MM-003 trial, was considerable, with 60% of patients experiencing drug-related G3/4 toxicity. Neutropenia (48% vs 16%) and pneumonia (13% vs 8%) were significantly more common in the pomalidomide arm. This resulted in frequent dose interruptions (67%) and dose reductions (27%). This suggests that for the majority of patients the 4 mg daily dosing schedule is too toxic, and that strategies to deliver reduced dosing of pomalidomide are of high practical relevance. The aim of this trial therefore is to establish that alternate day dosing of pomalidomide (4 mg q2d, d1-28) is non-inferior to daily dosing (4 mg d1-21 q28) in terms of efficacy of the drug with potentially less side effects.",

Summary: This is a psychosocial/behavioral study and does not involve administration of any treatment or diagnostic procedures. We will use a randomized trial to test the hypothesis that a decision analysis model that provides individualized estimates of quality-adjusted disease-free survival for each of the treatment options for clinically localized prostate cancer will lead to higher quality treatment decisions congruent with a patient's values leading to improved decisional regret and treatment satisfaction. In this trial, all patients would be evaluated at baseline for their utilities for various clinically important health states. The control arm will receive counseling regarding treatment options using standard patient-physician interactions and nomogram-predicted probabilities of treatment outcome for the various treatment options and they will be unaware of the decision analysis recommendation. The treatment arm would be counseled using standard patient-physician interactions and they would also be provided with a personalized treatment recommendations based on the decision analysis model prior to treatment selection. The primary endpoint of this study will be regret-free survival at 2 years after treatment. There will be a 1:1 randomization. A random permuted design will be used to assure approximate balanced number of patients in the two groups over time.",

Summary: This study is looking at a new drug called AZD4547 which is being tested for the treatment of oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer. AZD4547 is a drug which specifically \"blocks\" proteins called fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1) that are involved in the processes that help cancer cells to grow. These proteins may also be responsible for the development of resistance to hormonal therapies used to treat some breast cancers. AZD4547 is not yet approved for use in breast cancer and is therefore being used in this study as a research drug.\n\nThe investigators will also test the theory that it is not necessary for high levels of FGFR1 to be present in the body to see benefit from AZD4547.

Sponsor: Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute. Summary: RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and radiation therapy before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving tacrolimus, sirolimus, and antithymocyte globulin before and after transplant may stop this from happening.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving sirolimus together with tacrolimus and antithymocyte globulin and to see how well it works in preventing graft-versus-host disease in patients with hematologic cancer who are undergoing donor stem cell transplant.",

Interventions: Gabapentin 2g/day divided in two doses for 24 weeks (DRUG); Placebo 2g/day divided in two doses for 24 weeks (DRUG). Sponsor: Dayanand Medical College and Hospital. Summary: Alcohol use disorders are present across medical specialties, with alcohol-related deaths particularly prevalent in the categories of injury, liver cirrhosis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, disorders of the peripheral nerves and of the central nervous system. Alcohol dependence, also referred to as alcohol use disorder, is a chronic, relapsing disorder marked by compulsive alcohol use, an inability to stop drinking despite harmful consequences, and the emergence of a withdrawal syndrome upon cessation of use. Early abstinence is associated with activation of brain stress systems in the extended amygdala. Clinically, protracted abstinence involves symptoms of craving, mood and sleep disturbance, all of which have been identified as risk factors for relapse. Nonetheless, implementation of alcohol-specific medications remains limited across most medical specialties. Medications for treating alcohol dependence primarily have been adjunctive interventions, and only three medications-disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate-are approved for this indication by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Baclofen, an inhibitor of synaptic transmission through spinal reflex arcs via hyper polarization of primary afferent fiber terminals, was originally approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1977 for use in spasticity associated with neurologic conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord lesions. However, due to its pharmacologic properties it has also been investigated for the treatment of alcohol dependence. But in the clinical practice of study physicians, it was observed that most of the patients who were prescribed baclofen for alcohol dependence hit back to alcohol very soon despite being on the drug. Therefore there is a need to search for an alternative drug which could be beneficial for this population of patients. Gabapentin is Food and Drug Administration-approved for the management of epileptic seizures and neuropathic pain. It is believed to act by blocking a specific alpha-2d subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel at selective presynaptic sites and, as a result, to indirectly modulate Gamma Butyric Acid neurotransmission. Pre-clinical findings indicate that gabapentin normalizes the stress-induced Gamma Butyric Acid activation in the amygdala that is associated with alcohol dependence, and provide an excellent pre-clinical rationale for evaluating gabapentin as a treatment for alcohol dependence. Earlier studies of gabapentin in alcohol dependent subjects, attempting to abstain following withdrawal support the safety and potential efficacy of gabapentin in alcohol dependent patients, but definitive conclusions were limited by either small sample size, methodological, or dosing issues.",

Interventions: Vivosight Multi-beam Swept-Source Frequency Domain OCT scanner (DEVICE). Sponsor: Maastricht University Medical Center. Summary: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of cancer and entails approximately 80% of all cutaneous malignancies. This locally destructive neoplasm is commonly diagnosed by punch biopsy which is considered painful, causes procedural scarring and carries a small risk of infection and re-bleeding associated with invasive procedures. Moreover, awaiting the results of the subsequent histopathological examination causes treatment delay and can be stressful for the patient. The drawbacks of biopsy could be overcome by optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive diagnostic modality that may replace biopsy in up to 66% of patients. However, OCT assessors are scarce which hinders the implementation of OCT. This problem may be addressed by teledermatology in which remote OCT assessment by an assessor facilitates simultaneous assessment for multiple clinics. Remote OCT assessment withholds the OCT assessor from visually inspecting the lesion. But the effect of visual inspection on the diagnostic accuracy remains unknown and the question arises whether visual inspection is necessary for accurate OCT assessment. In this diagnostic case-control study we will determine whether distant OCT assessment without visual information on the lesion is non-inferior to distant OCT assessment with clinical and dermoscopic photographs (CDP-OCT).",

Interventions: Fecobionics (DEVICE). Sponsor: Giome. Summary: Colorectal Cancer is the commonest cancer diagnosed for both genders combined in Hong Kong. In 2015 16.6% of all new cancer cases registered on the Hong Kong registry were cancer of colon and rectum. With recent development in oncological and surgical treatments for rectal cancer, many patients are receiving sphincter-preserving surgery with low colorectal or coloanal anastomosis to avoid permanent stoma.\n\nUp to 80% of patients who has undergone low anterior resection (LAR), suffer from severe bowel dysfunction post operatively. Patients may suffer from a wide range of symptoms from incontinence, frequency, and urgency to constipation and feelings of incomplete emptying. This combination of symptoms after LAR is referred to as Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) which is associated with negative impact on quality of life (QoL). Originally, it was thought that these symptoms were due to early postoperative changes. Many studies report that the majority of patients experience longterm changes in quality of life after LAR. Therefore, a large number of patients worldwide are suffering from unpredictable, poor bowel function postoperatively affecting their day-to-day activity and quality of life. The cause of LARS is often multifactorial and difficult to define. Unfortunately, there is no cure for LARS at present. This trial is designed to use Fecobionics, a new Hong Kong based innovation of a simulated stool, to provide new mechanistic insights regarding anorectal physiological function post low anterior resection to understand the condition better to improve their treatment options.",

However, in patients with obesity, prostate hypertrophy, low located tumor or/and pelvic stenosis, the traditional laparoscopic or open surgery is not easy to conduct. Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) might serve as a better procedure for these patients, for it might ease the dissection of the low mesorectum. So far, several studies have showed the promising results of TaTME, but the multi-center data in China is still lacking. This nationwide registry study included more than 30 Chinese hospitals, aiming at obtaining data on the safety and efficacy of this procedure in Chinese patients with rectal cancer and encouraging future research in this field.",

This dose will then be used for a larger Phase II study to assess the efficacy of pyrimethamine for the treatment of CLL/SLL. Pyrimethamine is an antibiotic that is used for the treatment of certain infections. Previous research studies have shown that pyrimethamine may target a protein in tumor cells, called STAT3, which may be important for the growth of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) cells. Pyrimethamine can kill CLL/SLL cells in the laboratory, and we are therefore undertaking this study to assess whether pyrimethamine will result in clinical benefit or tumor responses in CLL in patients.",

Sponsor: SWOG Cancer Research Network. Summary: This phase III trial compares three-drug induction regimens followed by double-or single-drug maintenance therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in patients who are not receiving a stem cell transplant and are considered frail or intermediate-fit based on age, comorbidities, and functional status. Treatment for multiple myeloma includes initial treatment (induction) which is the first treatment a patient receives for cancer followed by ongoing treatment (maintenance) which is given after initial treatment to help keep the cancer from coming back. There are three combinations of four different drugs being studied. Bortezomib is one of the drugs that may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Lenalidomide works by helping bone marrow to produce normal blood cells and killing cancer cells. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as dexamethasone, lower the body's immune response and are used with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. Daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Patients receive 1 of 3 combinations of these drugs for treatment to determine which combination of study drugs works better to shrink and control multiple myeloma.",

Interventions: Candesartan (DRUG); Enalapril (DRUG). Sponsor: G\u00f6teborg University. Summary: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the major esophageal pre-neoplastic lesion in which dysplastic transformations eventually can lead to cancer development. Today, the only way for early detection of pre-neoplastic lesions is an endoscopic surveillance programme with tissue sampling for histopathology, the latter being the only validated biomarker for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)-risk available. New biomarkers are warranted for better patient selection before inclusion into BE surveillance programmes.\n\nEpidemiologic studies have demonstrated suppressed numbers of cancer prevalence in cohorts being under different medical treatment. In a British epidemiological study 2007 Sj\u00f6berg et al noted a lower prevalence of EAC among patients treated with antihypertensive drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) such as AT1R-blockers and ACE-inhibitors. The last decade this endocrine signalling system has been proven to be involved in pathological conditions such as inflammation, wound-healing and even cancer, in several organ systems.\n\nEarlier reports from the investigators laboratory indicate the existence of a local RAS in the esophageal wall musculature and in the squamous mucosa. In the investigators latest explorative study, the investigators discovered the altered expression of \"classical\" RAS components in BE with and without dysplasia (unpublished results).\n\nBy a possible alteration in RAS-related protein-expression in BE with increasing grade of dysplasia towards EAC, the investigator may have a possible \"pathway\" leading to biomarkers for cancer-development. Furthermore, the already well-known anti-hypertensive drugs ACE-inhibitors and AT1R-blockers may interfere with the risk of malignancy in BE. The investigators therefore wish to test, in an exploratory prospective randomized placebo-controlled setting, whether RAS-related protein-expressions in BE are altered by the addition of RAS-suppressant pharmaceuticals. In the same manner the investigators wish to see if the expressions of well-known biomarkers for cancer and inflammation are altered.",

Phase: PHASE1. Conditions: Breast Cancer. Interventions: Diindolylmethane (DIM) (DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT). Sponsor: Women's College Hospital. Summary: Women with a BRCA1 mutation face a lifetime risk of breast cancer of approximately 70% and a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of approximately 40%. A number of potential anti-cancer nutrients have been proposed, however, it is important that diet supplements be evaluated prior to general recommendation.\n\nThe risk of breast and ovarian cancer in carriers of a BRCA1 mutation might be lowered by some nutritional supplements. For example, green tea, broccoli and vitamin D are of potential interest. One dietary supplement that is thought to have potential for BRCA1 carriers is diindolylmethane (DIM), which is an active ingredient in broccoli and other green vegetables. DIM - is found in vegetables like broccoli and is available as a supplement in health food stores. The investigators think that DIM may increase the production of the normal copy of BRCA1 and offset the effect of the mutation.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine that there is a potential for oral DIM supplementation to result in the increased production of the BRCA1 protein in BRCA1 mutation carriers. The results of the study will also serve as an evaluation of the current use and success of preventive strategies for BRCA1 mutation carriers.",

Summary: Recently, the use of mobile health is increasing for the purpose of managing prognosis such as recurrence, survival and quality of life by using a wearable smart band and a smartphone application. In the era of the 4th revolution, mobile health for the purpose of comprehensive prognosis for cancer patients is becoming a very good tool.\n\nIt is possible to confirm the clinical significance of short-term and temporary health care through a mobile application and a smart band during the treatment process for cancer patients, but the study is insufficient to generalize the number of subjects.\n\nTherefore, for prostate cancer patients who need prognosis management after surgery, we will investigate the effect of a mobile application using a smart band which has a modular structure reflecting the treatment method and treatment process after surgery.\n\nThis study targets patients who underwent prostate cancer surgery. An intervention group (App+IoT device) uses a smart care application for 12 months. This application was tailored for prostate cancer patients and created by reflecting the treatment process after surgery. And they also uses a wearable smart band for 12 months. Control group is provided general education through the hospital brochure. Evaluation will be conducted 2-3days after surgery (before discharge), and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.",

Summary: Context:\n\nMen who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk for HPV-related anal neoplasia and anal squamous cell carcinoma; concomitant HIV infection roughly doubles that risk.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. To compare the efficacy of ablative therapy to topical imiquimod therapy in the management of anal dysplasia in HIV-infected men.\n2. To describe relationship between cytologic grade of anal dysplasia (as reported on screening anal Pap test) and pathologic grade reported on anal mucosa histopathologic examination.\n3. To describe demographic, sexual practices, HPV-specific, and HIV-specific correlates of anal dysplasia.\n4. To describe adverse effects associated with ablative therapy and topical imiquimod therapy.\n\nDesign:\n\nProspective, randomized controlled clinical trial. This will be a pilot study. All subjects will undergo baseline anal Pap, HRA with biopsies as indicated, and anal HPV testing. If AIN 2 or 3 is discovered on histopathologic examination, subject will be offered observation only or treatment. If he chooses treatment, he will be randomized to: 1) imiquimod anal suppositories three times weekly for 3 months, or 2) appropriate ablative therapy as determined by colorectal surgeon. During imiquimod treatment (not applicable to ablative group as their treatment will be completed in one visit) subjects will be followed for 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks with anal Pap, HRA with biopsies as indicated, and anal HPV testing. After therapy completed in each treatment group, subjects will be followed for 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months post-therapy with anal Pap, HRA with biopsies as indicated, and anal HPV testing. Observation only subjects will be evaluated every 3 months with anal Pap, HRA with biopsies as indicated, and anal HPV testing for 12 months. We have chosen a goal of 30 subjects in each treatment group and 10 subjects in the observation only group based on the likelihood of enrolling a study of this type in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nMain Outcome Measures:\n\n1. Anal Pap cytologic grade, including regression and recurrence during course of study\n2. HPV type in anal canal, including regression and recurrence during course of study\n3. Anal histology, including regression and recurrence during course of study\n4. Adverse effects experienced during treatment, recorded in symptom log",

Summary: Osteoid osteoma (OO) is a benign osteogenic tumor occurring in children and young adults, responsible for intense bone pain, which has a tendency to spontaneously heal with mineralization of the nidus, but extremely slowly. This healing may be accelerated in patients taking NSAIDs regularly during a few years. The long delay for healing and intense pain, explain why patients are quickly directed to surgeons or specialized radiology departments for tumor ablation. But percutaneous treatment or surgical excision destruction can expose the patient to a substantial risk in terms of neurologic or joint damages, depending on the location. Bisphosphonates treatment may be an effective alternative to percutaneous treatment by accelerating the natural history of OO.",

Summary: This study involved patients that have a cancer called diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), NK and T cell lymphomas (NK/TL) or classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) (hereafter these 3 diseases will be referred to as lymphoma). Patients lymphoma has come back or not gone away after treatment. Because there is no standard treatment for the patients cancer at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in all cases, the patients are being asked to volunteer in this research study.\n\nIn this study the investigators want to test a type of T cell made from a normal donor. The T cells the investigators will use are called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) specific T cells (EBVSTs) and are cells that the investigators have trained in the laboratory to recognize a EBV which is the virus that causes mono or kissing disease. Some patients with lymphoma have EBV in their cancer cells. Researchers have given T cell lines from normal donor EBVSTs to lymphoma patients who have EBV in their lymphoma cells and have seen responses in about half the patients.

Summary: This clinical trial evaluates the effectiveness of trained community engagement specialists for improving communication on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention and genetic testing among Hispanic/Latino/a/x (H/L) communities. CRC is the second and third leading cause of cancer deaths among United States (US) H/L men and women respectively. Knowledge of inherited germline mutations (changes in a gene that occurs in a sperm or egg cell) is critical for understanding cause of disease and can impact patient treatment options and outcomes. Educational programs and participant engagement approaches focused on H/L individuals considering Latino cultural values, literacy, numeracy, barriers faced, cultural beliefs and attitudes, as well as language of participants are much needed to address these observed disparities. The Community Genetic Navigation Specialists (CoGENES) Program focuses on increasing knowledge, and preparing the CoGENES trainees to help respond to questions, fears, and concerns regarding genetic testing, counseling, biospecimen (sample of urine, blood, or tissue cells) donation and participation in clinical trials to H/L community members, patients and their families. CoGENES may improve communication on colorectal cancer prevention and genetic testing which can help reduce cancer disparities among H/L communities.",

Conditions: Mucositis; Chemotherapeutic Toxicity. Interventions: a compound glutamine capsule (DRUG); a compound glutamine capsule simulated placebo (DRUG). Sponsor: Meng Qiu. Summary: Chemotherapy regimens not only improve the survival of patients with gastric cancer and colorectal cancer, but also cause obvious adverse reactions of digestive tract, such as chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and so on. These adverse reactions seriously affect the patients' quality of life and the efficacy of chemotherapy. Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid in the human body. Previous studies have shown that oral glutamine can help to keep the integrity of mucosal epithelium during chemotherapy and reduce the gastrointestinal side effects caused by chemotherapy. The addition of glutamine to parenteral nutrition can better maintain nitrogen balance and reduce the incidence of infection-related complications. A compound glutamine capsule, composed of L-glutamine and the traditional Chinese herbal formula Si-Jun-Zi-Tang which composed of ginseng, Atractylodes macrocephala, Poria cocos and licorice, has been widely used in China for 23 years to treat many types of gastrointestinal diseases, including gastrointestinal reactions induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome. However, so far, only a small sample of clinical trials have explored the role of glutamine in chemical mucositis, and there is a lack of prospective randomized controlled clinical trials to further verify its value in the prevention and treatment of chemical mucositis. The purpose of this study is to observe the efficacy and safety between a compound glutamine capsule and placebo in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced mucositis in patients with gastric cancer and colorectal cancer in a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.",

Short- and long-term HRQoL and symptoms will be evaluated in a longitudinal fashion over time to improve the understanding of the impact of the disease and CAR-T cell therapy on patients-wellbeing, symptom burden and daily functioning. This study will capture useful information on the impact of treatment toxicity, the burden of procedures on HRQoL outcomes. The planned collection of PRO and physician-reported adverse events ad early time point will help to compare and integrate these two points of view in healthcare assessment.",

Summary: This study is researching an experimental drug called odronextamab, referred to as study drug. The study is focused on participants with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or NHL. Participants with follicular lymphoma that has come back after treatment (called \"relapsed\") or did not respond to treatment (called \"refractory\") are eligible to take part only in Part 1A of the study.\n\nThis study is made up of 3 parts: Part 1A (non-randomized), Part 1B and Part 2 (randomized - controlled).\n\nThe aim of Part 1A and Part 1B of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug in combination with chemotherapy is and to determine the dose and schedule of the study drug to be combined with chemotherapy to be used in Part 2 of the study.\n\nThe aim of Part 2 of the study is to assess how effective the combination of the study drug with chemotherapy is in comparison with the combination of rituximab and chemotherapy (the current standard-of-care for NHL). Standard-of-care means the usual medication expected and used when receiving treatment for a condition.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug\n* How much study drug is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the study drug less effective or could lead to side effects)\n* The impact from the study drug on quality-of-life and ability to complete routine daily activities",

Conditions: Breast Neoplasms; Pain, Chronic; Quality of Life. Interventions: Online physiotherapy protocol based on pain neuroscience education and gradual exposure to movement. (OTHER). Sponsor: University of Seville. Summary: Introduction: Pain stands out among the sequelae that affect the quality of life of breast cancer survivors. Pain neuroscience education and graded exposure to movement are therapeutic approaches that have been shown to be effective in the management of chronic pain in other populations. However, there are no previous studies that combine them in this population. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of an online physiotherapy focused-person program which combines pain neuroscience education and graded exposure to movement, to improve the quality of life of breast cancer survivors. Methodology: The design of the study is a randomised controlled clinical trial and the sample will be 40 breast cancer survivors with pain in the last 6 months. A random method will be used to assign participants into two groups (experimental and control). The evaluator and statistician will be blinded to participant allocation while the experimental group will receive the therapeutic program which combines pain neuroscience education and graded exposure to movement-based intervention throughout therapeutic yoga; the control will be a passive group. There will be four points of assessment: the main outcome assessed will be quality of life measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B+4) and the secondary outcomes are variables related to pain experience (catastrophising, self-efficacy, kinesiophobia and fear-avoidance behaviours). All will be assessed using validated methods. SPSS program will be used for the data analysis. A mixed-model analyses of variance ANOVA (2x4) will be used to study the effects of the treatment on the dependent variables. An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed. All statistical tests will be performed considering a confidence interval of 95%. Trial record: NCT04965909.",

Summary: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of growth hormone replacement on women with growth hormone deficiency. Growth hormone deficiency means the body no longer produces growth hormone due to a tumor or some kind of disease of the brain in an area called the pituitary/hypothalamic region. This is the area of the brain where growth hormone is normally produced. We, the researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, will establish the effects of growth hormone replacement on cardiovascular parameters (laboratory tests, the flexibility of the arteries, changes in heart rate) in women with growth hormone deficiency. Our goal is to see if this therapy:\n\n* has effects on women's cardiovascular risk markers (special blood tests which indicate how healthy the heart and arteries are)\n* has effects on women's types and levels of various substances circulating in their blood\n* in women affects the stiffness of their arteries and heart rate variability in parallel with changes in cardiovascular risk markers\n* has different effects depending on whether women are pre or post menopausal.\n\nParticipation in this study is expected to last approximately 12 months.",

Conditions: Vaginal Stricture. Interventions: Vaginal Stent A (DEVICE); Vaginal Stent B (DEVICE); Vaginal Stent (DEVICE). Sponsor: Baylor College of Medicine. Summary: Each year, females need surgery to create a vaginal canal or pelvic radiation to treat cancer. The result is often a narrowing or scarring of their vagina. To aid in healing a stent is often placed. However, current stents are poorly designed. The goal of this trial is to test newly designed vaginal stents, with the hope of replacing the poorly retained and uncomfortable standard of care. This trial has two aims. In the first aim, healthy participants will evaluate two newly designed vaginal stents for retention, comfort, and safety over 24 hours. The preferred stent will then be worn by the healthy participants for 2 weeks, again evaluating retention, comfort, and safety. In the second aim, the stents will be evaluated by two different patient populations. Adolescent participants undergoing vaginal surgery for genetic anomalies, will have a stent placed following surgery for continuous wear for 2 weeks. Adult participants undergoing vaginal brachytherapy will have the stent placed following the final brachytherapy treatment. These participants will wear the stent continuously for 2 weeks, followed by an additional 2 weeks of continuous wear. Each participant will evaluate the stent for retention, comfort, and safety. We hypothesize the newly designed stents will be retained longer and be more comfortable compared to current standards of care.",

Summary: This study explores the clinical application of 68Ga-DOTA-CCK-FS PET/CT in detecting cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK-2R)-positive tumors, particularly medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and other malignancies. Led by Prof. Luo Yaping (PUMCH Nuclear Medicine) and Prof. Liu Zhibo (Peking University, radiochemistry expert), the trial will enroll 30-40 patients to compare 68Ga-DOTA-CCK-FS imaging with standard PET/CT (e.g., 18F-FDG or 68Ga-DOTATATE). The novel tracer shows higher tumor uptake and retention in preclinical studies, potentially improving diagnosis and treatment guidance for aggressive, CCK-2R-expressing cancers. The study leverages PUMCH's Class IV Radioactive Drug License for advanced radiopharmaceutical development. Risks are minimal (diagnostic radiation dose only), and participants receive free imaging assessments. Results aim to refine precision diagnostics for MTC and related tumors.",

It results in a decrease in muscle strength, overall physical activity, walking and the development of balance disorders and falls.

(Wendrich et al, 2017) and reduced overall survival (Hua et al, 2020).\n\nIt is measured by CT scan (assessment of muscle volume with respect to L3 using IMAGE J software) (Teigen et al, 2018) and by clinical tests (performance tests) (Swartz et al, 2016, Cruz-Jentoft et al, 2010).\n\nSeveral studies have shown a possible assessment of sarcopenia by measuring skeletal muscle mass with regard to C3 (Ufuk et al, 2019; Swartz et al, 2016).\n\nThis trial aims to evaluate the prevalence of sarcopenia in head and neck cancer evaluated by CT at C3.",

Through 3-D CTC culture, moreover, the cell number of CTCs can be adequately expanded. All these advantageous features are beyond what is currently possible by using the existing methods. In addition, the harvest of CTCs with above features is found valuable for the subsequent academic researches or clinical studies (e.g. molecular mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis, cancer-related gene mutation, biomarker discovery, and particularly CTCs-based chemotherapy drug testing).

Summary: Background: In a limited number of studies conducted with the participation of cancer patients, it has been reported that warm water bath may be beneficial for management of cancer-related fatigue.\n\nObjective: This experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effect of warm salt water foot bath applied to reduce the chemotherapy-induced fatigue.\n\nInterventions/Methods: Seventy-nine patients who were experiencing moderate or higher level of fatigue were included in this study conducted between November 2017-February 2018. 42 of the patients were assigned to the experimental group and 37 patients were assigned to the control group. A training booklet about chemotherapy-induced fatigue were given to all patients. In addition, the experimental group was asked to perform 20-minute warm salt water application to their feet for a week after the treatment by explaining and showing the video prepared about the preparation and practice of warm salt water foot bath. Subsequently, the patients were called by phone every day for one week to record their fatigue levels.\n\nResults: The 7-day fatigue course of both groups was similar. However the physical, emotional, affective and cognitive distress related to fatigue decreased in the experimental group but did not decrease in the control group.\n\nConclusion: The warm salt water footbath may be an effective approach in enhancing fatigue related quality of life. However, it is needed to conduct more comprehensive studies to express the effectiveness.\n\nImplications to Practice: Nurses can propose the use of the warm salt water footbath in the management of chemotherapy induced fatigue.\n\nKeywords: Chemotherapy Induced Fatigue, Warm salt water foot bath",

Conditions: Eosinophilic Disease; Immune Deficiency; HaTS; Urticaria Anaphylaxis; Elevated IgE Level. Sponsor: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Summary: Background:\n\n* Mast cells are responsible for most symptoms of allergic reactions. In some allergic diseases, it is unusually easy to cause mast cells to release their contents and cause allergic reactions. In other cases, mast cells grow abnormally and, in rare cases, can result in tumors. Mast cells also control other parts of the immune system.\n* Understanding why mast cells behave abnormally in allergic diseases is important to finding better ways for diagnosing and treating these potentially life-threatening disorders.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To screen mast cells at the genetic and functional levels to characterize abnormalities, identify mutations, detect carrier states, and/or develop therapies for such disorders.\n* To create a library of information about inherited diseases of mast cell homeostasis and activation, including piebaldism (problems with skin and hair pigmentation), anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ), food allergies, urticaria/angioedema (hives/swelling), immunodeficiency diseases, and autoimmune diseases.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients between the ages of 1 and 80 years who have been referred by a physician and are known to have or be suspected of having an inherited disorder of mast cells, in particular patients (and their relatives) with piebaldism, allergies, or anaphylaxis that is not caused by allergies.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Study population will consist of up to 1000 participants in a 5-year period. One third of the study population will consist of patients; the other two thirds will consist of biological relatives.\n* Evaluation is limited to testing on blood specimens; no treatment will be provided.\n* Clinical and research laboratory evaluations of patients will include the following:\n* Clinical evaluation and previous laboratory tests as documented in outside medical records by health care providers. A standard questionnaire will also be administered at the time of subject enrollment.\n* Blood collection for clinical laboratory testing, tailored to each subject s clinical evaluation where appropriate (5 ml).\n* Blood collection for research laboratory testing, tailored to each subject s clinical evaluation including genetic screening and assessment of mast cell growth and functioning and storage of additional frozen blood specimens for future studies (up to an additional 30 ml).\n* Evaluations of blood relatives will include the following:\n* Clinical evaluation as documented from outside medical records by health care providers and administration of a standard questionnaire.\n* Blood collection where indicated for diagnostic or research purposes.\n* After 12 consecutive months on the study, results from initial evaluation will be reviewed. Subjects with findings deemed to be of continued interest will be contacted and invited to remain as active participants to this protocol for another year, provided that they renew their consent to participate.",

Sponsor: Abdullah Khan. Summary: This phase Ib trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of CC-92480 in combination with elotuzumab and dexamethasone in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or that does not respond to treatment or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Multiple myeloma (MM) remains the second most common hematologic malignancy in the United States. A number of therapies have been approved for patients with MM, including CD38- and B-cell maturating antigen (BCMA)-targeted therapies (antibody and plasma cell treatments that help the body's immune system to kill cancer cells); however, patients will often relapse and become refractory to these therapies. Because of this, it is important to identify effective treatment options for patients progressing on anti-CD38 therapy and BCMA-directed therapies. Elotuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, which is a type of protein that can bind to other target cells to prevent them from working the way they should or cause them to act differently. Elotuzumab works by targeting a protein called SLAMF7, which is present on myeloma cells, and makes it easier for the immune system to target the cancer. CC-92480 works by binding to a protein called CRBN that triggers the breakdown of proteins: Ikaros and Aiolos, leading to cell death in multiple myeloma cells. Dexamethasone is a synthetic adrenocortical steroid, or steroid normally naturally made by the adrenal gland in the brain which has been produced in a laboratory, that helps to regulate the amount of different chemicals and water that are being processed by the kidneys. It is also used in patients with myeloma to help treat their disease. The combination of CC-92480 with elotuzumab and dexamethasone may be a safe and effective treatment when given to patients with relapsed or recurrent MM.",

Status: COMPLETED. Phase: NA. Conditions: Lymphoedema. Interventions: Compression Bandaging (OTHER); Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) and Compression Bandaging (OTHER). Sponsor: Fundaci\u00f3n de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica - Hospital Universitario de La Princesa. Summary: Hypothesis:\n\nTo know the utility of manual lymph drainage (MLD) as part of the Physical Complex Therapy has turn out relevant because of the exclusive dedication that it supposes to the therapist. To date, the evidence-base for MLD is very limited and only two studies analyze its relevance. The first study measured the effect of compression bandage with or without MLD. The group receiving compression and MLD had a significant reduction in limb volume and decreased pain, despite the fact the MLD was given only for one week (Johansson et al., 1999). A further study investigated the effect of eight sessions of MLD over two weeks in 42 women with breast cancer-related lymphoedema, and the findings suggested that MLD do not contribute significantly to oedema reduction, although the MLD course was relatively short and the study group was limited to those with mild to moderate swelling (20-30 % of difference). Information about the quality of life, using the questionnaire EORT QLQ-C30 was gathered but the results were not considered in the final assessment (Andersen and Cabbage 2000).\n\nSimilar studies would provide comparative and enlightening information with regard to the previous results. The investigators could determine if the MLD, in spite of not obtaining an improvement in the volume of the lymphoedema, provides a benefit in the reduction of the symptoms related to it.\n\nThe investigators hypothesized that MLD does not contribute significantly in volume limb reduction but it provides a clinical improvement regarding the quality of life according to the questionnaire EORT QLQ-C30.\n\nFor the calculation of the sample size the investigators depart from the following assumptions:\n\nThe effect of the standard treatment on the control group control will produce an average volume limb reduction of 5 %.\n\nThe effect of the treatment in the experimental group will be an average of the 25 % (a minor difference of effects would indicate a discreet effect of the tested treatment). The investigators also assume that, the standard deviation will be similar in both groups and near to 25 %. With this information and for an alpha risk of 0.05 and a power of 0.80 the calculation of the sample size is 20 patients in every group. Considering a rate of withdrawal of 30 % in every group, the appropriate sample size is 58 patients assigned in two groups of 29 patients.\n\nMain aim:\n\nTo analyze the effectiveness of Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) in the treatment of postmastectomy lymphoedema in order to reduce the volume of lymphoedema\n\nSecondary aims:\n\nTo analyze the duration of the reduction of the lymphoedema in the time. To analyze the improvement in the concomitant symptomatology of the lymphoedema using the results of two quality of life tests validated in Spanish: EORTC QLQ-C30 version 2.0, for the cancer in general and EORTC QLQ-BR23 specifically for the breast cancer. In particular, the items refering to the upper extremity (47, 48, 49) and to the corporal image (39, 40, 41, 42) and in which the higher the score the worse the result.\n\nMethodology:\n\nResearching Project with methodology of randomized, controlled clinical trial. Group A or Control: patients with standard treatment (care the skin, exercise and measures of compression -bandage for one month and later a sleeve of compression).\n\nGroup B or Experimental: patients with standard treatment (care of the skin, exercise and measures of compression (bandage for one month and later a sleeve for lymphoedema) and in addition they receive Manual Lymph Drainage Main variable: Volume reduction of the affected arm after the treatment expressed in percentage.\n\nNumber of patients: 58 women.",

Status: COMPLETED. Phase: PHASE2. Conditions: Leukoplakia; Periodontal Disease. Interventions: Ketorolac Rinse (DRUG). Sponsor: National Cancer Institute (NCI). Summary: In Phase II trials, treatment with ketorolac tromethamine oral rinse has been shown to block periodontal disease progression even in the absence of standard clinical intervention such as scaling and root planing which is routinely done to reduce the periodontal pathogen load that is driving the local destructive host inflammatory response. Resolution of periodontal disease has a favorable effect on normalizing the cellular and biochemical indices of inflammation as reflected by histological changes as well as the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin I beta (IL-1beta). In this trial, we will prospectively evaluate if eliminating the inflammatory process (via inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis) in the oral cavity has a favorable impact on reversing oropharyngeal leukoplakia. To test this hypothesis, up to 57 prospectively identified individuals with objective findings of oropharyngeal leukoplakia will be randomized to receive either a mouth rinse containing ketorolac or placebo. Ketorolac is a 7-fold selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), which has been designed for local delivery to maximize the drug exposure to critical oral target tissues while minimizing gastric and systemic exposure to the drug. All responses will be determined at the three month completion of trial using the response criteria developed at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The drug will be given for three months and then all the patients will be followed for one additional month off all oral treatment to observe for late side effects. Based on the analysis of oral exam and photographically documented change in the pretreatment area of leukoplakia, the response of all patients will be determined.\n\nThe evaluation of the outcome will include a measurable secondary endpoint consisting of an assessment of histological change as determined by serial punch biopsies of the oral cavity. In addition, a panel of carcinogenesis and inflammatory markers will be serially measured at baseline, at one month follow up or at study conclusion. In the residual tissue, other bioassays will be evaluated to determine their suitability as intermediate endpoint markers. The purpose of this study is a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of ketorolac as a potential chemoprevention agent for oropharyngeal cancer. If ketorolac administration in this preliminary Phase IIB trial is associated with reversal of leukoplakia, then a definitive Phase III chemoprevention trial with a cancer reduction endpoint (most likely in a cooperative group-type setting) may be the next validation step.",

Conditions: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia; Prostate Cancer. Sponsor: National Cheng-Kung University Hospital. Summary: Benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH) is a common disease in urology among old men. If BPH symptom cannot be controlled by drugs, then transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), is recommended. Although the procedure is quit safe, these old men often take anticoagulants and antiplatelets to control cardiovascular diseases, which arose some concerns for their bleeding risk. The management of anticoagulation in patients undergoing surgical procedures is challenging because interrupting anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. At the same time, surgery and invasive procedures have associated bleeding risks that are increased by the anticoagulant administration. Now, the recommendation about anticoagulants and antiplatelets discontinuation had no concrete evidence, especially in TURP. Furthermore, there is no relative studies done in Taiwan population, which calls for further investigation.",

Interventions: Intervention A - Behavioural Regulation (OTHER); Intervention B - Priority (OTHER). Sponsor: Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. Summary: Breast screening is a service offered by the NHS to help detect breast cancer and precancerous changes early at a time when treatment is more likely to be curative. An effective service must reach the 'at risk' but asymptomatic population. Breast screening uptake in London, consistently falls below the national target and is well below the national average. Uptake in West London is particularly low, with boroughs in Inner North West London having the some of lowest uptake rates in the country.\n\nRoutine text message reminders have proven effective at improving uptake of breast screening appointments. However little attention is paid to the content of the messages. Previous studies of text message reminders in other clinical areas have shown that the content of these messages matters and some text messages are more effective than others.\n\nThis protocol describes the design of a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of differently worded text messages on the engagement with breast screening in West London.\n\nTwo intervention arms were designed taking into consideration results of a 1000 woman survey to highlight the behavioural barriers that most predict attendance. The survey tested 15 behavioural constructs and the two that most strongly predicted history of attendance were used to inform the text message content of the intervention arms for this trial.\n\nTo this end, this randomised controlled trial (RCT) will test the current standard practice text message reminder against two intervention text message trial arms informed by the above described survey.\n\nThe setting is West of London Breast Screening Service and women aged 47-73 who are due for screening will be randomized to receive one of the three trial arms.\n\nThe primary outcome is the difference in uptake between trial arms. Further statistical analysis will analyse the difference in uptake by age group, deprivation score and previous attendance status.\n\nResult will inform how small changes to the word content may have significant effects on attendance at screening mammogram appointments.",

Summary: In the treatment of Ph-negative (Ph-) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) among adult patients, therapeutic outcomes remain suboptimal despite advances in chemotherapy and immunotherapy. A subset of adults with Ph- B-ALL have comorbidities or physiological limitations that preclude the safe administration of intensive regimens. In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has demonstrated promising safety and efficacy profiles in refractory or relapsed Ph- B-ALL across a wide spectrum of adult ages. These findings suggest that broader application of immunotherapy may represent a critical strategy to improve survival in this population. In this study, we propose a regimen that combines immuno-targeted agents with low-intensity chemotherapy for newly diagnosed adult patients with Ph- B-ALL. Our primary objective is to increase the rate of measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission (CR) following induction therapy, reduce the risk of relapse, and ultimately enhance overall survival.",

Its trade name is Kanglaite Injection, which has been approved in China and Russia. Kanglaite has anti-tumor effect and reduce treatment toxicity of tumor. Kanglaite could also improve the quality of life of patients and mitigate the condition of the cachexia. In china, two studies evaluating treatment of Kanglaite to nasopharyngeal cancer, found that Kanglaite can reduce radiotherapy mucositis. So far, Kanglaite on the prevention and treatment of radiation mucositis of the head and neck malignant tumor is still lack of strong clinical trial evidence. This is a phase II, single center, one arm study with subject to evaluate the acute radiation mucositis, nutritional status, and quality of life on the course of radiotherapy of head and neck cancer.",

Summary: Tumor cell plasticity (TCP) is a conubium of processes which lead to re-activation of developmental programs correlating with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and ultimately leading to acquisition of stem cell properties and transdifferentiation potential. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing TCP in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), i.e. the most frequent lung cancer subtype. The investigators recently identified prognostic 7-miRNAs/10-mRNAs signatures which accurately identified aggressive LUAD among patients with early-stage disease (Stage I). Furthermore, the investigators showed that such tumors show TCP features i.e. mesenchymal and stem-cell traits, high-metastatic potential. Here, the investigators aim to explore by RNAseq and by immunophenotyping at a single-cell level (scRNAseq/AbSeq), the molecular features of aggressive LUAD to unveil the mechanisms triggering TCP. The investigators predict thier results will be relevant for the development of more effective therapeutic protocols for management of aggressive LUAD.",

Interventions: Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) (PROCEDURE); Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Azienda USL Reggio Emilia - IRCCS. Summary: Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early-stage non-polypoid neoplastic lesions, particularly Laterally Spreading Tumors - Granular Type (LST-G) larger than 20mm, require effective endoscopic removal to prevent malignant progression. The two primary techniques for resecting these lesions are Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) and Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD).\n\nEMR is a widely used, minimally invasive technique that involves resecting the lesion with a diathermic snare after submucosal injection. While effective and safe, EMR often necessitates piecemeal resection, increasing the risk of local recurrence. In contrast, ESD, developed in Asia, allows for en bloc resection regardless of lesion size, ensuring more accurate histopathological assessment and lower recurrence rates. However, ESD requires greater technical expertise, has longer procedural times, and carries a higher risk of complications.\n\nIn Western clinical practice, EMR remains the standard treatment, whereas ESD is selectively performed in high-expertise centers. Given the lack of randomized controlled trials comparing EMR and ESD in Western populations, this study aims to provide robust clinical evidence to guide treatment decisions.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to compare the recurrence/residual adenomatous tissue rate at 6 and 12 months between EMR and ESD in patients with LST-G lesions of the colon and rectum",

Teh investigators previous phase I study (IRB #03-04-053) already confirmed that this vaccine procedure is safe in patients with malignant brain tumors, and with an indication of extended survival in several patients. However, the previous trial design did not allow us to test which formulation of the vaccine was the most effective. This phase II study will attempt to dissect out which components are most effective together. Dendritic cells (DC) (cells which \"present\" or \"show\" cell identifiers to the immune system) isolated from the subject's own blood will be treated with tumor-cell lysate isolated from tumor tissue taken from the same subject during surgery. This pulsing (combining) of antigen-presenting and tumor lysate will be done to try to stimulate the immune system to recognize and destroy the patient's intracranial brain tumor. These pulsed DCs will then be injected back into the patient intradermally as a vaccine. The investigators will also utilize adjuvant imiquimod or poly ICLC (interstitial Cajal-like cell) in some treatment cohorts. It is thought that the host immune system might be taught to \"recognize\" the malignant brain tumor cells as \"foreign\" to the body by effectively presenting unique tumor antigens to the host immune cells (T-cells) in vivo.",

Interventions: Lenalidomide (Revlimid) (DRUG); SBRT (RADIATION). Sponsor: Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. Summary: Solitary Plasmacytoma (SP) is a rare malignant plasma cell tumor, including Solitary Bone Plasmacytoma (SBP) and Solitary Extramedullary Plasmacytoma (SEP). Radiotherapy is the preferred treatment for SP. Although the local response rate of SP after radiotherapy is as high as 86%, 55% of patients will experience disease progression within 5 years.\n\nStereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), as a new technology for \"precision radiotherapy,\" delivers a higher dose of radiation to the tumor site through a few short treatment sessions while maintaining low-dose exposure to surrounding normal tissues. This approach achieves good local tumor control and effectively reduces radiotherapy-related side effects, making it valuable for application in SP patients. Additionally, numerous preclinical studies have confirmed that SBRT has positive immunomodulatory effects.\n\nBased on data published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013, lenalidomide-based immunomodulatory therapy significantly delays the progression of symptomatic myeloma with minimal toxicity in patients with smoldering multiple myeloma.\n\nThis study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of combining SBRT with lenalidomide in patients with SP, compared to conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The goal is to extend progression-free survival (PFS) in newly diagnosed SP patients, reduce adverse reactions, and improve quality of life.",

Interventions: Advanced Cancer Symptom Management (BEHAVIORAL). Sponsor: Stephanie Gilbertson-White. Summary: Nearly 20% of Americans and 41% of Iowans live in rural or non-metropolitan areas.(1) Lack of access to providers, long travel distances, and a disconnected health system contribute to increased distress and lower quality-of-life (QOL) in people with advanced cancer living in rural areas. (2) In the state of Iowa, 94% of rural residents have high-speed internet access. (3) The University of Iowa Health Care (UIHC) eHealth eNovation Center has developed the infrastructure to address the health care access gap in Iowa. The combination of wide availability of high-speed internet and the eHealth network provides an opportunity to develop and test interventions that leverage this infrastructure in order to address this important palliative care gap.\n\nThis is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of an eHealth self-management intervention for cancer symptom management. The intervention consists of a web-application that provides tailored educational information about cancer symptoms and a monitoring platform to track symptom distress and strategies used to manage them. Participants will also receive e-visits from a research nurse or research assistant via UIHC eHealth and eNovation video platform. The purpose of this study is obtain feasibility data about the intervention for a future RCT and to evaluate the OASIS intervention with patients living in rural Iowa receiving treatment for advanced cancer. The specific aims are:\n\n1. to evaluate the feasibility of the OASIS intervention to self-manage symptoms of rural patients with advanced cancer, including a) recruitment and retention, b) use patterns, c) usability of each component of the intervention (i.e., the e-visit platform and the web-application), d) acceptability of the intervention and study (i.e., satisfaction, barriers and facilitators to use, burden); and\n2. to determine preliminary effects of the intervention on self-management behaviors and symptom severity, symptom distress, and symptom interference.",

Conditions: Vasculopathy, Retinal, With Cerebral Leukodystrophy; Cerebroretinal Vasculopathy, Hereditary. Interventions: aclarubicin (DRUG). Sponsor: Washington University School of Medicine. Summary: The goal of the investigator is to utilize Aclarubicin to treat patients with Retinal Vasculopathy with Cerebral Leukodystrophy (RVCL), a rare and devastating genetic disease with no available specific treatment. RVCL results from a mutation in the tail end of the TREX1 (Three Prime Repair Exonuclease 1) gene, a major deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair enzyme. The RVCL-specific mutations cause expression of a truncated and mislocalized protein. RVCL is an inherited disorder whose symptoms begin at middle age and initially predominantly affects the eye and brain. Because it is an 'autosomal dominant' disease, it strikes both males and females equally. A person with RVCL has a 50-50 chance of transmitting the gene to each child.\n\nThe investigator's published studies demonstrated in a mouse model for RVCL and in vitro studies with patients' cells that defects were corrected by use of Aclarubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic often used to treat cancer. Thus, there is a strong rationale for conducting a clinical trial of aclarubicin in patients with RVCL.\n\nThe dosage to be initially administered to RVCL patients initially will be \\< 10% of that typically used in cancer therapeutics and will be given monthly on four consecutive days for six months. Patients will undergo assessments every six months to determine disease response. Patients that do not have clear objective response may be dose escalated by 1 dose level with permission of the principal investigator permitting the patient has not previously experienced any toxicities requiring dose modifications. We will evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of Aclarubicin for the treatment of RVCL and evaluate its effects on cellular function. This work will generate the first clinical research data on the investigational product's utility in treating RVCL.\n\nPatients are followed for at least 2 years upon completion of Aclarubicin administration completion. We are not longer administering the drug, but are in the post-drug follow up arm of the study.",

Status: COMPLETED. Conditions: Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor. Interventions: Regorafenib (Stivarga, BAY73-4506) (DRUG). Sponsor: Bayer. Summary: This is an observational study in which data already collected from people with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors are studied.\n\nIn this observational study data are collected from participants who have private insurance or Medicare and who had started regorafenib treatment.\n\nGastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a type of cancer that most commonly originates from the stomach or small intestine. Advanced means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\n\nThe study drug, regorafenib, is already approved for doctors to prescribe to people with GIST. Regorafenib works by blocking certain proteins that cause the growth of cancer cells. Regorafenib is recommended as the third choice of treatment for patients after imatinib and sunitinib have stopped working or have caused side effects that are too severe to continue the treatment. In addition, it is also the recommended first choice of treatment in people with GIST who had low levels of protein called succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) protein. This condition is called SDHdeficient GIST. However, doctors might sometimes give it in a different order. To better understand the treatment patterns with regorafenib for GIST, more knowledge is needed about its use in the real world.\n\nThe participants in this study had started treatment with regorafenib as part of their regular care from their doctors.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn more about the use of regorafenib treatment among people with advanced GIST who have private insurance or Medicare in the United States. To do this, researchers will collect information on:\n\nDuration of treatment with regorafenib (also known as duration of therapy)\n\nThe length of time it took for participants to switch to another GIST treatment after starting regorafenib (also known as time to next therapy)\n\nThe data will come from the participants' information stored in a database, called Merative MarketScan for people in the United States. Data collected will be from April 2002 to September 2023.\n\nResearchers will track the data of people with GIST who started regorafenib and will follow them for at least 28 days.\n\nIn this study, only available data are collected. No visits or tests are required as part of this study.",

Sponsor: Chinese PLA General Hospital. Summary: Acute myelocytic leukemia ( AML) is a highly heterogeneous group of malignant hematopathy. Chromosomal translocation with t (8; 21) (q22; q22) , about 10 \\~ 15% incidence in AML and 40% incidence in the AML-M2 type of leukemia, is a karyotype that is considered to have a good prognosis. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that high-dose Ara-c regimens may benefit for patients, but with 30 to 40% relapse and serious risks on myelosuppression, infection and bleeding in high-dose Ara-c consolidation chemotherapy and more than 70% recurrence rate with \uff08tyrosine kinase\uff09KIT mutation. So the exploration of a relatively safe and efficient consolidation therapy is one of the difficult problems to be solved in the treatment of mitigatory t (8; 21) AML.",

Interventions: Polatuzumab Vedotin (DRUG); Rituximab (BIOLOGICAL); Rituximab and Hyaluronidase Human (BIOLOGICAL); Venetoclax (DRUG). Sponsor: Academic and Community Cancer Research United. Summary: This phase II trial studies the effect of polatuzumab vedotin, venetoclax, and rituximab and hyaluronidase human in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, polatuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Polatuzumab attaches to CD79B positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cell growth. Rituximab hyaluronidase is a combination of rituximab and hyaluronidase. Rituximab binds to a molecule called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Hyaluronidase allows rituximab to be given by injection under the skin. Giving rituximab and hyaluronidase by injection under the skin is faster than giving rituximab alone by infusion into the blood. Giving polatuzumab vedotin, venetoclax, and rituximab and hyaluronidase human may work better than standard therapy in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma.",

Nelfinavir is an antiviral drug normally used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving nelfinavir, cisplatin, and external beam radiation therapy may work better than giving only cisplatin and external beam radiation therapy in treating patients with vulvar cancer.",

Status: RECRUITING. Phase: EARLY_PHASE1. Conditions: Glioma. Interventions: Biological: personalized vaccine Based on genetic and transcriptional sequencing information, personalized peptide vaccines would be designed and produced; (BIOLOGICAL). Sponsor: Biogenea Pharmaceuticals Ltd.. Summary: Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors arising from glial cells in the central nervous system and are associated with poor prognosis and significant morbidity. The most aggressive form, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), remains particularly challenging to treat, often exhibiting resistance to conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation. The average survival for patients with GBM is approximately 15 months, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can improve outcomes. Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain cancer diagnosed and still carry a poor prognosis despite aggressive multimodal management. Despite the continued advances in immunotherapy for other cancer types, however, there remain no FDA approved immunotherapies for cancers such as glioblastoma. Neoantigen vaccines are a form of immunotherapy involving the use of DNA, mRNA, and proteins derived from non-synonymous mutations identified in patient tumor tissue samples to stimulate tumor-specific T-cell reactivity leading to enhance tumor targeting. Up to and including the current time, we have only nascent understandings, at the molecular and submolecular level, of how immunity is generated and maintained. As a result, we do not have fundamental mechanistic understandings of vaccine:antigen interactions, of vaccine-directed and initiated routes of immunity, nor how, through adjuvants and changes in our biologic environment (such as the intestinal microbiome), we might direct such immune responses. In particular, in the field of vaccinology we have few collaborations between biology, physics, and chemistry...or what has been termed \"convergence science\"...but particularly from physics and the field of quantum mechanics. Biophysics led to quantum biology and quantum immunology reflecting quantum dynamics within living systems and their evolution. Unfortunately, despite the seismic influence of immunotherapy on oncology today, there remain no FDA approved immunotherapies for GBM due to the lack of efficacy observed in several randomized clinical trials. The TAMAVAQ approaches enable a quantitative understanding of immune response kinetics following neoantigen-based peptide vaccine treatment. Insights gained from challenges can be used to design better vaccines and evaluate the potential candidate vaccines in silico. The TAMAVAQ models also can guide such decisions on treatment regimens such as dosing and infusion frequencies.",

Conditions: Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy; Rectal Tumor; Surgery; Surgery--Complications. Interventions: Rectal Resection (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Campus Bio-Medico University. Summary: Neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (NRCT) represents a milestone in the treatment of selected rectal tumours. Ideal time interval between the end of NRCT and surgery is still debated; a 6-8 weeks time interval is considered optimal, but shorter or longer intervals have been associated with better oncological outcomes. Moreover, there is a lack of data about clinical postoperative outcomes and different time intervals after the end of NRCT. Here, effect that different time intervals have on postoperative complications with particular regard to the anastomotic dehiscence have been evaluated.\n\nMethods One hundred-sixty-seven patients underwent surgery after long-course NRCT. Three different time intervals were considered: (0-42; 43-56; \\>57 days).",

Interventions: WALC-R (BEHAVIORAL); Information leaflet (OTHER). Sponsor: Anglia Ruskin University. Summary: Introduction Sedentary behaviour refers to activities of low energy expenditure in lying and sitting positions. Examples include driving, watching television, playing cards, puzzles and working on a computer. Studies suggest that between 60% of older people world-wide reported sitting for more than four hours per day. Sedentary behaviour increases as older people become older, have problems with cognition and when they are very ill. Excessive participating in sedentary behaviours is associated with an increased risk of heart problem, cancer death and diabetes. However, we do not know for certain whether or not participating in sedentary behaviour could cause poorer cognition.\n\nWhat does the study hope to achieve?\n\nThis feasibility study will test whether the main study, which is planned for later, is workable with regards to the following:\n\n* Will reducing sedentary behaviour using our online health coaching intervention (WALC-R) be acceptable to research participants and caregivers?\n* How many participants can be successfully recruited to the future trial?\n* What is the rate of adverse event associated with proposed study intervention?\n\nMethod:\n\nThis is a 13-week randomised feasibility study. We will randomly assign study participants to either the health coaching intervention (WALC-R) or receiving health guidelines on recommended physical activity. We aim to recruit 40 participants aged 50 and over who have been diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment.\n\nThe future main study will be larger and test whether:\n\n\u2022 'WALC-R', an online intervention designed to reduce participation in sedentary behaviour can improve cognitive function in older people with Mild Cognitive Impairment compared with providing an information sheet about physical activity.",

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING. Phase: PHASE2. Conditions: Recurrent Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma; Stage IV Lung Cancer AJCC v8. Interventions: Biospecimen Collection (PROCEDURE); Computed Tomography (PROCEDURE); Ivonescimab (BIOLOGICAL); Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PROCEDURE); Sacituzumab Govitecan (BIOLOGICAL). Sponsor: SWOG Cancer Research Network. Summary: This phase II Expanded Lung-MAP treatment trial compares how well sacituzumab govitecan alone, ivonescimab alone, or sacituzumab govitecan in combination with ivonescimab works in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) or is stage IV and has a change in at least 1 of these genes: ALK, EGFR, HER2 (ERBB2), MET, NTRK, RET, and ROS1. This type of gene change is called an actionable genomic alteration (AGA), which means certain treatments can target the change to fight the cancer. Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a toxic drug called SN-38. Sacituzumab govitecan is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as TROP2 receptors, and delivers SN-38 to kill them. Ivonescimab is a bispecific antibody that can bind to two different antigens at the same time. It binds to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), a protein found on the surface of T cells (a type of white blood cell) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein found on the surface of tumor cells. Ivonescimab may strengthen the immune system and interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving a combination of sacituzumab govitecan and ivonescimab work better than either drug alone, and sacituzumab govitecan alone, ivonescimab alone, or sacituzumab govitecan and ivonescimab together may work better than standard treatments at shrinking NSCLC with an AGA.",

Sponsor: University Hospital, Bordeaux. Summary: Standard treatment of rectal cancer is rectal excision with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. A new concept suggests organ preservation as an alternative to rectal excision in good responders after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to decrease surgical morbidity and increase quality of life. The rational is the fact that 15% of patients have sterilized tumours after radiochemotherapy for T3T4 rectal cancer. The French GRECCAR 2 trial is the first phase III trial investigating this strategy: patients with T2T3 low rectal carcinomas (size \u22644 cm) received 50 Gy with capecitabine and good clinical responders (\u22642 cm) were randomized between local and rectal excision. The main findings were: the rate of complete pathologic response was higher after radiochemotherapy for small T2T3 than for T3T4 tumours (40% vs 15% ypT0) and good pathologic responders (ypT0-1) were associated with zero positive mesorectal nodes.\n\nThe objective of the new trial is to increase the proportion of patients treated with organ preservation by optimizing tumour response. As compared to Folfiri, tritherapy Folfirinox has been shown to enhance the response rate. In patients with colorectal metastases, response rate and R0 resection were twice higher, resulting in improved survival. Folfirinox also increases response and chance of R0 resection rates in initially unresectable colorectal metastases, compared to standard or intensified bi-chemotherapy regimens. Adding two months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Folfirinox) before radiochemotherapy, the investigators expect to increase chance of organ preservation rate, as compared to radiochemotherapy alone.",

Summary: For locally advanced adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction(AEG) (cT3-4aN+M0), neoadjuvant chemotherapy was improved to downstage T and N stage, increase the resectability of tumor, and finally improve the long-term survival. Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy for locally advanced AEG could be a novel therapy to increase response rate and resectability and reduce recurrence rate. Sintilimab in this study is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection which has been approved for several malignant tumors. This study is a multi-center, open-label, randomized phase II clinical trial to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of sintilimab in combination with perioperative chemotherapy in locally advanced AEG.",

Conditions: Cancer; Insomnia; Cancer Related Insomnia. Interventions: Ciwujia capsules (DRUG). Sponsor: Shanghai Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Summary: Cancer poses a severe threat to human physical and mental health as well as survival. High diagnostic rates of cancer and various treatments can significantly impact patients' sleep quality, leading to diverse sleep disorders. Cancer-related insomnia (CRI) is a prevalent sleep disturbance among cancer patients, potentially associated with the tumor itself, treatment modalities (such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy), psychological status, pain, fatigue, and other symptoms. Although reported incidence rates vary across studies, CRI is consistently high and severely compromises patients' quality of life. Core symptoms include difficulty falling asleep, sleep maintenance difficulties, and early morning awakening, which contribute to daytime fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, ultimately detrimentally affecting patients' health and quality of life. The pathogenesis of CRI is complex, potentially involving multiple factors including the tumor's direct effects, treatment side effects, psychological distress, pain, and fatigue.\n\nThe primary component of Ciwujia capsules (containing Eleutherococcus senticosus extract) is Ciwujia extract. To clarify the clinical efficacy of Ciwujia capsules for cancer-related insomnia in real-world clinical settings, this study will employ a multicenter, prospective, open-label, real-world research design. It is projected to involve 30-50 centers over an approximate 3-year trial period, with a planned enrollment of 3,000 subjects. Changes in sleep-related indicators before and after treatment will serve as the primary endpoint observation metrics. The study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety profile of Ciwujia capsules in treating insomnia disorders in cancer patients, thereby providing robust evidence for identifying effective Chinese herbal medicine therapies for sedation and sleep promotion.",

Interventions: Targeted biopsies (OTHER). Sponsor: Assistance Publique - H\u00f4pitaux de Paris. Summary: The management of localized prostate cancer remains controversial because of a risk of over diagnosis and over treatment. Focal therapy represents an approach to improve the therapeutic ratio of prostate cancer treatments. Focal therapy has been developed as minimally invasive procedure with the aim of providing equivalent oncological safety, reduced toxicity and improved functional outcomes. Multiparametric (mp) MRI Imaging may provide a reliable mean of monitoring for disease recurrence, and has been suggested as the most accurate imaging tool currently available for systematic detection of recurrence, pre-biopsy and preoperative mapping for an eventual salvage therapy. However, question about the performance of MRI and targeted biopsy in monitoring and defining successful therapy and follow up has been poorly evaluated. Modalities (standard biopsy, ablation zone biopsy vs targeted biopsy) and number of biopsies to be performed, depending on the results of MRI, remains unanswered due to a lack of available data.\n\nWe hypothesize that the combination of MpMRI of the prostate with subsequent targeted biopsy (TB) may improve detection of prostate cancer and may therefore improve the follow-up of men after focal therapy (FT) to better identify patients that need a salvage treatment and when.",

Summary: During the past three years, a revolutionized radical surgical approach for rectal cancer (\"down to up TME \" approach or \"transanal TME (TaTME)\"approach, which is opposite to the conventional approach) has emerged and it is a concept that combines natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery(NOTES) and total mesorectal excision(TME) with curative intent. The feasibility, safety and reproducibility of it were first demonstrated in swine survival experiments and subsequently in human cadaver series, and then it was successfully applied to human patients in few centers around the world, most of which were performed with assistance of laparoscopy, namely hybrid transanal TME. In addition, pure-NOTES without conventional laparoscopic assistance (no scar) has also been demonstrated, though the cases were more limited. In the initial stage, our group has successfully performed this no-scar transanal TME in a series of human cadavers with satisfactory outcome. Hence the investigators conduct this study, looking to see if this pure transanal NOTES investigational procedure is a safe and effective approach to radically remove rectal cancer of the mid and lower rectum and meanwhile, if it can reduce pain, gain faster recovery and better function and life quality when gaining the best cosmetic effect.",

Interventions: \"We Want to Know\" campaign, Patient survey at 2 time points (OTHER). Sponsor: University of Massachusetts, Worcester. Summary: Cancer patients often experience problems in their care, many of which are caused by communication breakdowns. Some communication breakdowns lead to adverse events and even harmful errors. Deficiencies in provider-patient communication can compound patients' distress, lower the quality of care, and disrupt patient-provider relationships. There is little research on patients' and providers' experiences of the communication breakdowns that precipitate adverse events and errors, or on effective responses to these events. Because of this, cancer providers are unsure how to communicate with patients in these difficult situations. The goal of the proposed study is to improve patient-centered communication around adverse events and errors in cancer care. Our specific aims are: 1) To describe patients' experiences with communication around adverse events and errors in cancer care, 2) To describe providers' experiences and practices with communication around adverse events and errors in cancer care, 3) To develop practical recommendations, provider training materials and patient educational materials for improving communication around adverse events and errors in cancer care, 4) To disseminate the recommendations and materials through three health plans, and 5) To conduct a preliminary evaluation of the perceived usefulness and impact of the materials. The investigators will first conduct interviews with breast and colorectal cancer patients who have experienced adverse events or errors at 3 Cancer Research Network (CRN) health plans (Atlanta, Georgia; Seattle, Washington and Worcester, Massachusetts). The interviews will focus on instances where patients believe that better communication might have prevented an adverse event or error, or mitigated the event's impact. Next the investigators will conduct focus groups to understand providers' attitudes and experiences with these communication dilemmas, and use simulations to describe providers' communication practices. Finally, the investigators will interview health plan leaders to identify the systems factors that influence communication with patients around adverse events and errors. These perspectives will be synthesized to create patient and provider educational material for improving communication. Three advisory panels: a Patient Advisory Panel, a Health Plan Advisory Panel and a Dissemination Advisory Panel (including all 14 CRN health plans) will help create and disseminate these educational interventions. Dissemination will occur at the three core clinical sites. The investigators use patient and provider surveys to evaluate the educational materials' impact. This evaluation will provide the evidence-base to refine the study products before widespread dissemination throughout the CRN and beyond. The project will have the advantage of the CRN infrastructure, the CRN Clinical Communication Research Center, and is led by nationally recognized communication researchers.",

Summary: This phase II trial is studying how well giving trastuzumab together with ixabepilone works in treating women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining trastuzumab with ixabepilone may kill more tumor cells.",

Conditions: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis. Interventions: Cytarabine (DRUG); Vinblastine/prednisone (DRUG). Sponsor: Baylor College of Medicine. Summary: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is a type of cancer that can damage tissue or cause lesions to form in one or more places in the body. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a cancer that begins in LCH cells (a type of dendritic cell which fights infection). Sometimes there are mutations (changes) in LCH cells as they form. These include mutations of the BRAF gene. These changes may make the LCH cells grow and multiply quickly. This causes LCH cells to build up in certain parts of the body, where they can damage tissue or form lesions.\n\nFor most patients with LCH, standard-of-care vinblastine/prednisone are used as front-line therapy while cytarabine therapy has been used as therapy for patients who develop recurrence. No alternate treatment strategy has been developed for frontline therapy in LCH.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to compare previously used vinblastine/prednisone to single therapy with cytarabine for LCH. We will evaluate the utility of an imaging study called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to more accurately assess areas of LCH involvement not otherwise seen in other imaging studies as well as response to therapy. We also want to identify if genetic and other biomarkers (special proteins in patient's blood and in patient's cancer) relate to the response of patients LCH to study treatment.",

All participants will be on treatment and take darolutamide with ADT until their cancer spreads, they have a medical problem, or they leave the study. The results will then be compared with patients' results from another study who received ADT alone (CHAARTED).\n\nThis study will also assess safety by gathering adverse event information throughout the duration of the study. An adverse event is any medical problem, related or not to study treatment that a participant has during a study.\n\nThe study drug, darolutamide, is already available for doctors to prescribe to patients with prostate cancer that has not yet spread to other parts of the body. It works by blocking a protein called a receptor from attaching to a hormone called androgen that is found in men. This protein can also be found in prostate cancer cells. ADT is a treatment that doctors are currently able to prescribe to patients with mHSPC. ADT is used to lower the amount of the androgen hormone.",

Conditions: Pancreatic Steatosis; Pancreatic Cyst. Interventions: MRI for pancreatic fat and liver fat quantitation (DIAGNOSTIC_TEST). Sponsor: Chinese University of Hong Kong. Summary: Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality in Hong Kong and the seventh leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. In 2020, approximately 496000 new cases of pancreatic cancers were diagnosed globally . Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal cancer with a case-fatality rate of 94.0% globally. In Hong Kong, both the incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer have increased over the past decade.\n\nDue to the deep-seated location of pancreas, it is difficult to diagnose pancreatic cancer at an early stage, which in turn leads to delays in cancer treatment and poorer survival. Despite advances in oncologic treatment, the 5-year survival rate of metastatic pancreatic cancer remains poor (\\~2.9%). As such, there has been growing interest to improve pancreatic cancer prevention and survival by:\n\n1. reduction of modifiable risk factors (eg, cigarette smoking, obesity, diabetes),\n2. screening for early detection of high-risk pre-malignant lesions in selected high-risks patients with strong family history of pancreatic cancer and/or certain germline mutations of pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes (eg, BRCA1, BRAC2, DNA mismatch repair genes in Lynch Syndrome, etc) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and\n3. surveillance of pre-malignant precursor lesions such as mucinous pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) by imaging and/or EUS to identify high-risk neoplastic progression indicated for surgical resection.",

Status: RECRUITING. Phase: NA. Conditions: Colo-rectal Cancer; Colon Lesion. Interventions: novel type of health education (OTHER). Sponsor: National Taiwan University Hospital. Summary: Colorectal cancer is the cancer with highest incidence in Taiwan. The disease itself and subsequent treatment cause huge impact on the physical, psychological, and spiritual parts and social role of a patient. Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions is possible. Early treatment can reduce the impact on quality of life and economics.\n\nColonoscopy is an important tool for diagnosis of colorectal proliferative lesions. Qualified bowel preparation can enhance sensitivity and reduce false negative of the colonoscopy. However, multiple factors influence the quality of bowel preparation. This study aims to investigate whether the animation video and game-based health education is more effective and satisfying than conventional health education, and to explore the difference of knowledge dissemination and quality of bowel preparation between novel and conventional methods.\n\nThis study is a randomized controlled trial and uses structural questionnaire for study participants. Before the main study, the investigators will consult professors' opinions to adjust and enhance validity of the questionnaire, and the investigators will perform pretest to calculate its reliability. The investigators will enroll participants at the out-patient-department and the health management center. Questionnaires may be completed by on-site paper or phone with internet resources. The main participants of this study are adults aged 18 and more, and planned to receive colonoscopy. The questionnaires investigate the spent time, patient satisfaction, knowledge of bowel preparation and results of colonoscopy of different approaches of health education. Multiple linear regression will be applied to calculate the possible significance difference between two kinds of health education.\n\nThe investigators expect this study (1) to explore whether novel health education enhances patient satisfaction (2) to investigate the efficiency of novel health education, and (3) to compare the effect of knowledge dissemination and quality of bowel preparation between experimental and control groups. This study will develop the model of health education to facilitate holistic health care.",

Interventions: Anti-pneumococcal vaccination with prime-boost strategy in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (BIOLOGICAL). Sponsor: University Hospital, Tours. Summary: Pneumococcal infections remain frequent and potentially fatal. To prevent them, two anti-pneumococcal vaccines exist: a 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevenar\u00ae) and a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax\u00ae). For their utilization, several studies approved a prime-boost strategy. It consist two administer Pneumovax\u00ae at least two months later than Prevenar\u00ae. Patients with diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) have a higher-risk to develop a pneumococcal infection. The main reason is immunosuppression, induced by rituximab (B cell depletion), chemotherapy and lymphoma. Patients are treated by immunochemotherapy, combining rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) and conventional chemotherapy (CHOP). However, those patients have a low rate of vaccination (about 15%).",

Conditions: Metastatic Colorectal Cancer. Interventions: mFOLFOX6 (DRUG); MVA-BN-CV301 (BIOLOGICAL); FPV-CV301 (BIOLOGICAL); Nivolumab (DRUG). Sponsor: Patrick Boland. Summary: This is a multi-center Phase II randomized study. We plan to enroll 78 patients with biopsy-proven hepatic-limited metastatic colorectal cancer deemed resectable after multi-disciplinary discussion. Eligible patients must have confirmed isolated liver metastases by radiographic imaging of the investigators' choosing. Imaging must include the chest, abdomen, and pelvis regardless of imaging modality chosen. Patients will be randomized to either the control arm or the experimental arm. The control arm will receive mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks for 4 cycles concurrently with Nivolumab. The experimental arm will first be treated with 2 vaccinations of MVA-BN-CV301 given two weeks apart (Days -28, -14) concurrently with Nivolumab followed by 4 vaccinations of FPV-CV301 given two weeks apart concurrently with mFOLFOX6 and Nivolumab, which will again be administered every 2 weeks for 4 cycles (FPV-CV301, mFOLFOX6 and Nivolumab) After Cycle 4, patients will be re-evaluated for surgical resection by re-staging CT chest, abdomen and pelvis (C/A/P). Patients still considered resectable will undergo surgical resection with the goal of complete resection. Patients who cannot be completely resected will continue to be followed on study, and an additional appropriate candidate will be randomized to the corresponding arm.\n\nWe will collect peripheral blood and tumor tissue at the time of surgical resection, if applicable, or by re-biopsy if resection is not possible. Post-operative therapy will begin when patients are deemed ready by their surgical oncologist team. Patients in the control arm will then undergo another 8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 with Nivolumab administered concurrently. Nivolumab will then be administered every four weeks. The experimental arm will receive the same post-operative regimen but including FPV-CV301 boosters given concurrently with mFOLFOX6 and Nivolumab. FPV-CV301 will then be administered every 12 weeks, and Nivolumab every 4 weeks. We will collect peripheral blood for evaluation of correlates upon the completion of therapy. The vaccination approach of initial immunization during the neoadjuvant period followed by FPV-CV301 boosters for two years postoperatively was chosen to optimize the induction of a long-lasting tumor-specific host response. Neoadjuvant vaccination will also allow for analysis of the tumor microenvironment in resection specimens.\n\nPost-therapy patients will be under surveillance per NCCN guidelines with repeat CEA every 3 months for 2 years followed by every 6 months for 1 year (total 3 years), repeat CT of the C/A/P every 3 months for 2 years followed by every 6 months for up to 1 year (total 3 years), and colonoscopy at one year with repetition based on findings at the time of the procedure.",

Summary: EUS-guided biliary drainage is gaining popularity as a means of achieving endoscopic drainage in patients with failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) 1. EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy (HGS) is a type of EUS-guided biliary drainage and the procedure is employed when the ERCP fails due to a malignant bile duct obstruction but the papilla is inaccessible or if the first of the duodenum is infiltrated by tumor. Recently, a novel dedicated HGS (Niti-S, Taewoong Medical, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) has become available, the stent has a novel design to that prevents the stent from migration, further improving the safety.\n\nThe aim of the current study is to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of the novel lumen apposing stent for EUS-guided HGS. The hypothesis is that the device is safe and effective.",

Conditions: Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer. Interventions: Arm A : standard neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy group (DRUG); Arm B : adjuvant FOLFOX group (DRUG). Sponsor: Yonsei University. Summary: The introduction of total mesorectal excision (TME) and the progress of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has significantly reduced the risk of local recurrence in locally advanced rectal cancer. However, systemic recurrence rate is not being improved and that is considered as the cause of unsatisfactory overall survival of patients with rectal cancer. Relatively higher systemic relapse rate than local recurrence rate is probably due to the insufficient control of systemic micrometastasis during adjuvant chemotherapy. The efficacy of adjuvant combination cytotoxic chemotherapy after surgery in treatment of rectal cancer remains controversial. In addition, preoperative radiotherapy increases surgical complication such as anastomosis site leakage and radiotherapy itself worsen sexual and urinary function and bowel habit which result in aggravation of the quality of life. Furthermore the preoperative chemoradiotherapy upto 3 months not only extends treatment period but increases cost of care. To reduce the possibility of overtreatment, it is needed to confirm that the preoperative chemoradiotherapy is absolutely necessary to locally advanced rectal cancer patients with safe circumferential margin (CRM) resected curatively by standardized TME operation.\n\nIn this study, investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy after TME without preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer having spared CRM are not inferior to that of current standard treatment.",

Conditions: Hepatocyte Receptor; Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Interventions: Study on samples of tumor and peri-tumor tissues from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (OTHER). Sponsor: Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Amiens. Summary: Primary liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 7th most common cancer in humans; 9th in women (figures from the Association for Research against Cancer ARC). This cancer is a major public health problem on a global scale. Patients, whose diagnosis is often late, are at advanced stages of the pathology, even those who benefit from locoregional treatments have a poor prognosis and suffer from a lack of curative therapeutic strategies. CHC is highly refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy and so far the response rates to conventional systemic chemotherapy has provided a clinical benefit where survival was prolonged by more than 25% in patients with advanced CHC. Further efforts are needed to effectively manage HCC. Knowledge of the mechanisms regulating proliferation and inhibiting the sensitivity of transformed cells to apoptosis is the key to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.\n\nSeveral new therapies, called targeted therapies, are tested in clinical trials. Currently, the most effective molecular agent for targeting the Raf pathway is sorafenib capable of also inhibiting tyrosine kinases of VEGFR and PDGFR. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, decreases the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro that inhibit the activity of targets present in tumor cells (CRAF, BRAF, V600E BRAF, c-KIT, and FLT-3) and tumor vascularization VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and PDGFR-beta). Despite the real benefit of this treatment, its efficacy (three months of overall survival) and its indication remain limited to Child-Pugh A, WHO 0-2 patients in whom curative treatment is contraindicated. In addition, several patients have resistance to Sorafenib and thus find themselves in therapeutic failure, thus limiting the therapeutic choice for these patients.\n\nResistance to treatment with Sorafenib limits the therapeutic choice. The mechanisms responsible for this resistance remain to be elucidated. Drug resistance proteins, MDR Multi-Drug Resistance, is a family of molecules whose expression increases in the cancer cell and ensures the repression of chemotherapy molecules outside the target cancer cell. This family includes the proteins ABCG2, MDR and MRP1. Our in vitro studies show that treatment of CHC Huh-7 cells with Sorafenib (10 mM) induces the specific expression of the transcripts of the MRP-1 protein without any effect on the expression of the ABCG2 and MDR protein. In addition, sorafenib has an effect on the expression of hepatocyte SLAMF3 receptor transcripts, a receptor recently identified in hepatocyte tissue. Indeed, it has been shown that the expression of SLAMF3 is lowered in the cancerous tissue compared to the healthy tissue and that the reintroduction of a strong expression in the cancer cell inhibits its proliferation by inhibiting the MAPK Erk pathway, Cancer cells to apoptosis and inhibits the uptake of tumor masses in the Nude mouse (I. Marcq, et al., 2013).",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, stopping them from dividing, or stopping them from spreading. Giving the drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for uterine cancer.",

Summary: LCCC2415 examines the antiproliferative effect of tirzepatide on the endometrium of endometrial cancer (EC). This is a pre-operative window clinical study. Endometrial biopsy samples from patients before tirzepatide treatment will be compared to their post-intervention hysterectomy specimens. If archival tissue is unavailable, a fresh biopsy will be taken before tirzepatide treatment. Post-intervention tissue will be collected from the hysterectomy specimen.\n\nThe hypothesis is that tirzepatide's anti-tumorigenic effects are due to both an improvement in the host's metabolic milieu (indirect effect) and a direct effect on the EC tumor microenvironment via the inter-related pathways of insulin, lipid, and mTOR signaling. Therefore, tirzepatide may be an innovative approach to effectively induce weight loss and inhibit tumor growth in EC, the most obesity-driven of all cancers.",

Conditions: Obesity, COVID-19 Infection. Interventions: NIVOLUMAB (DRUG); Routine standard of care (OTHER). Sponsor: Hospices Civils de Lyon. Summary: Although SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus) due to COVID-19 evolves poorly towards ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and death, there is to date no validated drug available for severe forms of COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 undergo a drastic decrease of T lymphocytes (LT) count, while the remaining ones display an \"exhausted\" phenotype, due to immunosuppressive pathway activation among which the Programed cell Death 1 (PD1) receptor pathways. LT exhaustion is responsible for host anergy towards viral infection and leads to increased risk of severe forms of COVID-19. Moreover, while the number of systemic LT PD1+ correlates with poor prognosis clinical stages of COVID-19 infection, healing from COVID-19 associates with LT PD1 expression normalization. Chinese epidemiologic data identified clinical risk factors of poor clinical evolution (i.e. ARDS or death), among which is found obesity, similarly to observation previously obtained during H1N1 infection (flu virus).\n\nObese persons display meta-inflammation and immune dysfunction, a condition similar to ageing, thus termed \"Inflamm-aging\", thus also used during obesity. Inflamm-aging, characterized by cytotoxic LT exhaustion and reduced NK cell (Natural Killer cell) cytotoxic function secondary to PD1 pathway activation, could contribute to the poor prognosis observed during cancer and infection in obese individuals. We hypothesize that the immunocompromised profile observed during obesity contribute to their vulnerability towards COVID-19.\n\nIn cancer or certain infection diseases, NIVOLUMAB, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, restores exhausted LT immunity. We thus hypothesize that NIVOLUMAB-induced immunity normalization could (i) stimulate anti-viral response also during COVID-19 infection and (ii) prevent ARDS development, which has previously been associated with low LT count concomitant with increased inflammatory cytokine production.\n\nThis randomized controlled therapeutic trial, using an add-on strategy to usual standard of care, aims at demonstrating the efficacy and safety of NIVOLUMAB-induced cytotoxic LT normalization, to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19+ adult obese individuals with low LT, since they are at risk of poor prognosis. We postulate that NIVOLUMAB will increase the number of individuals able to stop oxygen therapy at D15",

Sponsor: University Hospital, Geneva. Summary: Persistent dyspnea is a debilitating symptom, that is common and difficult to treat. This symptom is found in many different diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and metastatic cancer. Dyspnea is associated with many other symptoms, including anxiety, depression, and fatigue and is responsible for a significant reduction in quality of life. To date, only opiates are recommended for the pharmacological treatment of persistent dyspnea.\n\nThe effectiveness of hypnosis is well known in the treatment of anxiety and delivered to patients suffering from chronic dyspnea for this reason. One randomised controlled study has shown that a single 20-minute mindfulness sessions could significantly reduce general symptom burden and have a significant impact on anxiety and depression in palliative care patients. Furthermore, the intervention had no negative side effects.\n\nOur aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of three hypnosis sessions on breathlessness mastery in patients with persistent dyspnea, using as a primary outcome the mastery domain of a validated tool, the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ).",

Interventions: euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (DRUG); muscle biopsy (PROCEDURE); indirect calorimetry (DEVICE). Sponsor: Hospices Civils de Lyon. Summary: An increase of longevity and of the number of men and women older than 60 years old is observed in most industrialized countries. Aging is a complex, multifactorial and continuous process involving physical and biological modifications such as a notably decrease in glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes risk. Insulin sensitivity follow-up during aging is difficult mainly because of many confounding factors (environment, lifestyle).\n\nIn 2006, SUVIMAX 2 study began, based on the monitoring of volunteers who participated in former SUVIMAX study (1994-2003). This study was a randomised trial which was designed to study the link between a low antioxidant intake and risk of cancer or ischemic heart disease. The subjects recently had a health check-up including complete information about their diet, physical and neurosensory status. Based on these data, a score was established to classify subjects according to their quality of aging (\"successful aging versus \"problematic aging\") These volunteers, who undertook a 13-year follow-up (dietary and medical status), constitute the reference population to determine the mechanisms involved in the insulin resistance development in aging.\n\nThe purpose of our research work is to determine whether the quality of aging could influence insulin sensitivity, by studying metabolic profile and change in gene expression (genes involved in glucose metabolism and metabolic senescence in muscle tissue) during aging.",

Conditions: Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic; EGF-R Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Interventions: Dacomitinib (DRUG). Sponsor: Shanghai Chest Hospital. Summary: This is a single center and exploratory study, aiming to analyze the efficacy and safety of dacomitinib-a pan-HER and irreversible TKI in subjects with diagnosed stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC. All subjects will have tumors that test positive for at least one uncommon EGFR activating mutation (do not have drug-resistant pattern, e.g. 20 insertion or 20T790M). All patients will be of histo- and/or cytopathology confirmed. Determination of the EGFR mutation type will be performed in the pathological department of Shanghai Chest Hospital. Both ARMS method or targeted sequencing are acceptable. It is not acceptable for subjects with the presence of the exon 20T790M mutation or insertion together with either EGFR activating mutations (exon 19 deletion or the L858R mutation in exon 21) or uncommon EGFR mutations. 10ml peripheral blood must be available for concomitant study. All eligible subjects must have adequate renal, hepatic, and hematologic function, as defined in \"inclusion criteria\".\n\nPatients will receive continuous oral therapy with the study drugs (dacomitinib 45 mg) until progressive disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1 or judged by investigator that the patient no longer derives clinical benefit from study treatment. At the time of progression and removal from study treatment, the subject may receive any regulatory approved therapy at the judgment of the investigator. Timely and complete disease assessments in this study are important. Every effort should be made to ensure disease assessments performed as scheduled to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of efficacy. Failure to perform any of the required disease assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status for that time point. Frequent off schedule or incomplete disease assessments have the potential to weaken the study conclusion.\n\nSubjects who have progressive disease per RECIST version 1.1 confirmed by the investigator believes it is in their best interest to continue on their study therapy, will be allowed to continue on their therapy with or without local therapy (e.g. surgical removal and/or radiation of a single lesion), at the discretion of the investigator until any alternate or additional systemic anti-cancer therapy regimen is implemented. The subsequent new cancer therapy (including, for systemic therapy, drugs administered, date of initiation and discontinuation of each drug) and OS will be recorded. Each subject will be followed for survival status and subsequent cancer therapies up to 48 months from the date of first dosing. This data may be collected from subjects by telephone, and if collected should be entered into the CRF.",

Sponsor: Emory University. Summary: This clinical trial tests an individualized online home-based exercise program in gynecologic cancer survivors and its impact on gut microbiome (the bacteria and microorganisms that live in the digestive system) and symptoms such as pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and cognitive impairment. These symptoms can significantly reduce the quality of life (QoL) and survival rate in this cancer population. Thus, promoting physical activity among cancer survivors may help mitigate these severe symptoms. Using online platforms such as Zoom can help participants access an individualized exercise program that meets their specific needs to engage in physical activity and decrease their symptom burden. Home-based exercise, by providing self-chosen time and location and low costs, can address some barriers to physical activity for cancer survivors. An individualized online home-based exercise program may be feasible, and may improve symptoms and quality of life in gynecologic cancer survivors.",

Conditions: Radical Cystectomy; Muscle-Invasive Bladder Carcinoma; Multiparametric MRI; Vesical Imaging Report and Data System. Sponsor: Samsung Medical Center. Summary: Bladder Cancer (BCa) is the 9th most common cancer worldwide. In general, BCa is presented as a non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) in 70% of patients and treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-BT). However, in cases of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), radical cystectomy (RC) is the gold standard of treatment. Therefore, It is important to distinguish MIBC from NMIBC.\n\nTo date, pathologic staging is based on the result of TUR-BT before RC. However, it is operator dependent, thus residual cancer may be remained depending on surgical experience. Therefore, about 7%-30% patients of MIBC can be underestimated with NMIBC, and it can be increased to 45% if the muscle is not resected. Consequently, it has been raised the need for imaging test to overcome diagnostic limitations.\n\nMultiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has been widely used in the field of diagnosis of BCa. In 2018, the Vesical Imaging Report and Data System (VI-RADS) was published using T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging, and 5-point VI-RADS scoring system has been proposed and reported as an imaging test useful for assessing muscle involvement in primary bladder cancer Therefore, in this study, we investigate the diagnostic performance of the VI-RADS scoring system that can differentiate NMIBC from MIBC in primary bladder cancer.",

Conditions: Telangiectasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic; Rendu Osler Disease. Interventions: Low CT scanner without injection dose (RADIATION); Ultra-low dose CT scanner without injection (RADIATION). Sponsor: Hospices Civils de Lyon. Summary: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is linked to a dysregulation of angiogenesis leading to the formation of arteriovenous malformations (AVM): cutaneo-mucous telangiectasia and visceral shunts. The diagnosis is clinical and based on Cura\u00e7ao criteria: recurrent epistaxis, cutaneo-mucous telangiectasia, hereditary signs and presence of visceral AVM.\n\nPulmonary AVMs (PAVM) expose patients to many potentially life-threatening complications, such as strokes or brain abscesses due to the right-left shunt created and the lack of filtration barrier of the pulmonary capillary within the AVM. These patients should therefore have regular monitoring throughout their life by a chest CT scanner every 5 to 10 years in the absence of PAVM at the initial scan or more often if PAVMs are present. The management of PAVMs is based on their early detection and embolization in interventional radiology during which is set up within the afferent artery of the PAVM an embolizing agent, the coil.\n\nHowever, the risk of cumulative irradiation exposure from thoracic scanners and repeated thoracic embolizations over time could be reduces by a decrease of X-rays dose.\n\nA new thoracic CT imaging protocol validated in the United States in the primary screening of lung cancer, the ultra-low dose protocol, is a CT scanner acquired at an irradiation dose equivalent to that of a frontal chest x-ray and in profile. The dose reduction is of 40 times the usual dose of a chest CT scanner.\n\nThe lung parenchyma has a high natural contrast on thoracic CT images and there are few adjacent attenuating structures allowing a drastic reduction of dose. However, from this dose, the image quality is degraded with an increase of the image noise. The diagnostic performances have to be confirmed with qualitative and quantitative measurements.\n\nThus, the objective of this study is to compare the sensitivity and the specificity of the current scanner and the ultra-low dose scanner to reduce the exposure to X-rays.",

Summary: Targeted therapy against the CD30 molecule has achieved some progress in CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma, but its efficacy remains unsatisfactory. Previous studies have demonstrated that N-glycan modifications in the extracellular domain of target proteins can disrupt immune synapse formation with CAR-T cells. Our preliminary research has shown that ablation of N-glycans on CD30 enhances the anti-tumor effect of CD30-targeted therapy.It is hypothesized that Eliglustat, by inhibiting GSL synthesis,may potentiate the anti-tumor effect. Consequently,we designed and initiated a single-center, open-label phase I/II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of Eliglustat combined with CD30 targeted immunotherapy in patients with CD30-positive lymphoma.

Summary: In this randomized clinical trial, patients with Stage IV solid tumors will be enrolled in a patient navigator-led generalist palliative and supportive care intervention or in usual care led by their treating physician. The patient navigator will assess the patient's palliative and supportive care needs using standardized quality of life and symptoms questionnaires and present this assessment to a multidisciplinary team composed of oncologists and palliative care specialist. The multidisciplinary team will develop a personalized supportive care plan for the patient which will then be presented and discussed by the patient navigator. Those interventions which are accepted by the patient will be implemented by the patient navigator, who will also provide education and teaching. The patient navigator will also help eligible patients complete advanced directives according to local rules and regulations. The patient navigator will follow the patients both in person and by telephone to ensure that the recommended interventions have been implemented. Three months after enrollment the patients will undergo quality of life and symptom assessment once again, and the implementation of interventions will be recorded.",

Conditions: High-risk Prostate Cancer. Interventions: urine collection (OTHER); canine detection (OTHER). Sponsor: Assistance Publique - H\u00f4pitaux de Paris. Summary: The sense of smell allows both humans and dogs to carry out a chemo-sensory analysis of their environment. Volatile organic compounds enter the nasal cavities and bind to receptors in the nasal mucosa. Neuroepithelium cells perform chemoelectric transduction of olfactory information. The latter is supported by one of the fibers of the olfactory nerve which crosses the cribriform plate of the ethmoid to arrive in the olfactory bulb of the brain. Incorporating this information can lead to behavioral responses. The dog has a sense of smell 100,000 times more sensitive than humans, it is able to detect one particle among 1 trillion. The use of detection dogs involves learning the behavioral response to an olfactory stimulus. Prostate cancer represents 25% of male cancers, it is the second deadliest cancer in France with 10,000 deaths per year. Diagnosis of prostate cancer requires a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test and a digital rectal examination. In the event of an abnormality in one of these parameters, a prostate MRI is indicated, supplemented by prostate biopsies in the event of an abnormal MRI. However, one situation remains open to discussion: what should be done when faced with a normal MRI despite an abnormal PSA level or digital rectal examination? In this situation and according to current recommendations, the practitioner has the choice between performing prostate biopsies, i.e. an invasive procedure with a high risk of being negative, and simple monitoring, this time with the risk of missing the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Several studies have shown the effectiveness of dogs in detecting very specific volatile organic compounds. Can the investigators train them to detect the catabolites of prostate tumours?",

Conditions: Breast Cancer. Sponsor: Martin-Luther-Universit\u00e4t Halle-Wittenberg. Summary: The improvement of the healing rates for breast cancer is based to an important part on the consistent use of so-called adjuvant (\"supporting \") medicamentous therapies, including chemotherapy. However this success has a price due to still inaccurate knowledge of the individual risk of relapse: a high number of unnecessary therapies are applied (over-therapy!). The invasion factors uPA (plasminogen activator of the urokinase type) and PAI-1 (uPA inhibitor) were described extensively as strong and independent prognosis factors with high clinical relevance for patients with node negative breast cancer. Compared to clinical and pathological factors (further: \"traditional factors \") they show better estimation of the relapse risk leading to an avoidance of redundant adjuvant chemotherapy and may thus essentially contribute to the improvement of the quality of life in these women. In this study we aim to evaluate, how large the portion of the patients with early, operable, node negative breast cancer will be, in whom, by improved low-risk identification through uPA/PAI-1, adjuvant chemotherapy can be omitted.",

Status: RECRUITING. Conditions: Polycythemia Vera; ET (Essential Thrombocythemia); Polycythemia Vera (PV); Essential Thrombocythemia (ET); Primary Myelofibrosis (MF); Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF); Myelofibrosis; Myelofibrosis (MF); Myelofibrosis, Primary; Myelofibrosis, Post ET. Sponsor: MPN Research Foundation. Summary: The MPN PROGRESSion Registry is a multi-year, observational research study designed to improve understanding of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)-a group of rare, chronic blood cancers that include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (MF), pre-fibrotic primary myelofibrosis (pre-PMF), secondary myelofibrosis, myeloproliferative neoplasm-unclassifiable (MPN-U), MPN in accelerated phase (MPN-AP), and MPN in blast phase (MPN-BP), post-MPN Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and MDS/MPN overlap syndrome as defined above per WHO 2022 criteria, including patients originally diagnosed with one of these conditions but who have received one or more SCTs and/or BMTs . These conditions are characterized by abnormal blood cell production in the bone marrow and may lead to complications such as blood clots, bleeding, bone marrow fibrosis, and, in some cases, progression to acute leukemia.\n\nThe central hypothesis of the registry is that collecting and analyzing real-world, longitudinal data-including electronic health records (EHRs), laboratory values, treatments, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs)-from a diverse population of people living with MPNs will help identify patterns and predictors of disease progression, treatment response, quality of life, and long-term outcomes. These insights are intended to guide future research, inform clinical guidelines, and support improvements in patient care.\n\nThe registry is non-interventional and observational; participants do not receive investigational treatments, and all medical care continues under the supervision of their own physicians. Data collection includes EHRs, PRO surveys, patient-reported symptom and lab tracking, insurance claims, and, in the future, may include linkages with other relevant disease registries and datasets. Potential collaborations under consideration include those with the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) MPN Registry, the Mayo Clinic MPN Database, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), the SEER Program, Harmony Alliance Foundation, and the National Cancer Database (NCDB).\n\nThe registry emphasizes the patient voice, incorporating lived experiences related to hallmark MPN symptoms such as fatigue, pruritus (itching), bone pain, night sweats, and social and emotional impacts. Participants will be followed for at least five years, with many enrolled for ten years or longer, to capture the natural history of disease and long-term outcomes. PRO surveys will be completed approximately every six months, and EHR data will be regularly reviewed to track changes in clinical status, treatment, and disease evolution.\n\nStatistical analyses will use descriptive and inferential methods to examine clinical characteristics, symptom burden, disease trajectories, and patient-centered outcomes. Planned subgroup analyses may compare differences across diagnoses, treatment approaches, demographics, or genomic factors. Analytic plans will be finalized during the course of the study and may evolve in response to emerging scientific questions.\n\nThe registry is open to adults (18 years or older) living in the United States who have been diagnosed with any of the included MPN subtypes and are willing to share health information and complete study surveys. Individuals currently enrolled in interventional clinical trials or unable to provide informed consent may be excluded. Participation is voluntary, and participants may withdraw from the study at any time without affecting their medical care.\n\nPrivacy and data security are core priorities. Participant data will be securely stored and managed in accordance with all applicable privacy laws and research regulations. No identifiable information will be shared with external parties without appropriate authorization. Oversight is provided by a Steering Committee and a Patient Engagement Advisory Committee (PEAC), ensuring rigorous scientific, ethical, and patient-centered governance.\n\nThe registry is sponsored by the MPN Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization advancing research and patient advocacy in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Participants can contact the registry team at any time with questions and will receive periodic updates on study findings.\n\nThis study aims to address critical gaps in understanding the real-world experiences of people with MPNs-such as symptom burden over time, risk factors for progression, and how different treatments impact patient outcomes. Findings may inform clinical trial design, support biomarker discovery, and contribute to the development of updated treatment recommendations. The registry is committed to including participants from diverse backgrounds and clinical settings to ensure findings are broadly applicable across the MPN community. Summary results will be shared through scientific publications, presentations, and other dissemination efforts to advance MPN research and care globally.",

CD137L-DC-EBV-VAX is a product made from one of our own immune system cells (dendritic cell, DC). Dendritic cells are immune cells that help to stimulate our body's T lymphocytes to fight cancer by presenting specific proteins from the cancer cells. The investigators have developed in the laboratory a highly effective dendritic cell which is primed to activate T cells with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins. It is hoped that this will stir an immune response to recognize NPC cells and kill them as part of body's immune surveillance system.",

Interventions: ACE inhibitors (OTHER); beta blockers (OTHER). Sponsor: Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. Summary: The survival rate of cancer patients has greatly increased over the past decades' mainly due to early detection and the use of new medications with higher doses and combined protocols. This achievement comes with the price of cardio toxicity, leading to cardiac dysfunction ranged from transient asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to cardiac death. In the long term, the risk of death from cardiovascular causes exceeds that of tumor recurrence for many types of cancer. As a result of the increasing number of long-term cancer survivors the magnitude of this problem is growing. Early identification of cardio toxicity can be identified by clinical follow-up and the use of electrocardiography, cardiac biomarkers (Troponin, brain natriuretic peptide) and echocardiogram. Past studies imply that the addition of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) and beta blockers to the patient's treatment may prevent the development of cardiac dysfunction. However, currently there are no specific or clear guidelines for the follow-up and management of cardio-toxicity in cancer patients.\n\nThe aim of the study: To try to identify who are the patients at increased risk for developing cardio toxicity, by follow up of clinical evaluation, cardiac biomarkers and echocardiogram examination, in purpose of early diagnosis, management and prevention of cardiac events. For achieving this the investigators will build a registry which will include all the oncologic patients going an evaluation in the cardio-oncology clinic in the Tel Aviv Medical Center .",

Summary: Re-irradiation in gliomas is a therapeutic option at recurrence before of 2nd-line chemotherapy. The dose of re-irradiation with conventional fractionation is unfortunately limited by the risk of symptomatic radionecrosis that is significant for cumulative doses above 100 Gy. The use of unconventional low dose rate pulsed radiotherapy (pLDRT) can reduce the risk of radiotoxicity while taking advantage of the cellular hyper-radiosensitivity that occurs at low dose-rates. The present study therefore aims at evaluating whether the use of pLDRT in the re-irradiation of recurrences of gliomas allows maintaining a low risk of symptomatic radionecrosis even for cumulative doses greater than 100 Gy.",

Treatment with mBACOD has been promising, but the toxicity is very high. Patients treated with mBACOD have very low white blood cell counts. GM-CSF has increased the number of white blood cells in animal studies and preliminary human studies. It is hoped that including GM-CSF among the drugs given to lymphoma patients will prevent or lessen the decrease in white blood cells caused by mBACOD.",

In patients with colorectal cancer feasible radical surgery, plasma ctDNA methylation detection was performed before and after surgical treatment and during regular follow-up to explore the predictive effect of plasma ctDNA methylation status at different time points on postoperative recurrence. To explore whether postoperative dynamic monitoring of plasma ctDNA methylation can be used for adjuvant chemotherapy efficacy evaluation and whether it can indicate tumor recurrence and metastasis earlier than imaging examination.",

Phase: PHASE3. Conditions: Brain Metastases. Interventions: Memantine (DRUG); Hippocampal-avoidant (HA-WBRT) Radiotherapy (RADIATION); Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Canadian Cancer Trials Group. Summary: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a commonly used treatment for brain tumors. It is a one-day (or in some cases two day), out-patient procedure during which a high dose of radiation is delivered to small spots in the brain while excluding the surrounding normal brain.\n\nWhole brain radiation therapy with hippocampal avoidance (HA-WBRT) is when radiation therapy is given to the whole brain, while trying to decrease the amount of radiation that is delivered to the area of the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a brain structure that is important for memory. Memantine is a drug that is given to help relieve symptoms that can be caused by WBRT, including problems with memory and other mental symptoms.\n\nHealth Canada, the regulatory body that oversees the use of drugs in Canada, has not approved the sale or use of memantine in combination with WBRT to treat this kind of cancer, although they have allowed its use in this study.",

Interventions: Integrated Lifestyle Intervention (BEHAVIORAL). Sponsor: Virginia Commonwealth University. Summary: Obesity and chronic inflammation influence the development and progression of many types of cancer. These conditions share several of the same causes, including physical inactivity, poor nutrition, stress, and insufficient sleep. Emerging adulthood (ages 18-25) represents an important developmental period in which to address behaviors and psychological variables that affect both weight status and inflammation. At least 40% of emerging adults have overweight/obesity, and this transition from adolescence to early adulthood is associated with significant increases in fast food consumption, decreases in physical activity, unpredictable sleep schedules, and alarmingly high rates of depression and perceived stress.\n\nDespite this high risk for obesity, very few weight loss interventions are designed specifically for emerging adults. Preliminary findings from weight loss interventions targeting this population have shown some promise, but generally produce modest outcomes with less consistent effects than programs in older adults. Depression and stress have been found to interfere with weight loss among emerging adults, and may be in part responsible for poorer outcomes. This proposal will develop and test an Integrated Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) that comprehensively addresses both psychological distress and traditional weight management targets. This novel approach has not been tested before and has the potential not only to enhance weight loss outcomes in this high risk population, but also to produce reductions in markers of inflammation beyond those achievable by weight loss alone.",

Summary: Multiple Myeloma (MM), the second most common hematological malignancy, continues to pose challenges in precise clinical identification. As a potential solution, nuclear medicine immuno-PET imaging has emerged as a promising approach. However, traditional full-length antibody probes suffer from delayed tumor uptake peaks and low target-to-background ratios, limiting their clinical utility. In our study, a peptide or nanobody targeting BCMA was developed by computer-aided designing, which was subsequently radiolabeled with 68Ga to create a novel molecular probe, 68Ga-MM-BC1. This research aims to overcome the diagnostic limitations of MM and may also offer valuable insights for molecular-targeted imaging in other malignant tumors.",

Lifileucel (Amtagvi), the first FDA-approved TIL therapy, has demonstrated significant success in treating unresectable or metastatic melanoma by utilizing the patient's own immune cells to combat cancer. This study aims to apply a similar approach to Brain cancer. TILs will be harvested from patients' tumors, expanded in vitro, and infused back into the patients following a non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen. Pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the PD-1 receptor on T cells, will be administered to enhance the immune response. The primary endpoint is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) of this combined therapy. Secondary endpoints include disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), and quality of life (QoL). This trial aims to offer a novel, personalized treatment option for patients with limited therapeutic alternatives.",

Sponsor: University Hospital, Montpellier. Summary: Improving personalized cancer treatments and finding the best strategies to treat each patient relies on using new diagnostic technologies. Currently, for colorectal cancer, the methods used to decide who gets additional post-surgery treatment are suboptimal. Some patients get too much treatment, while others do not get enough.\n\nThere is a new way to explore if there is any cancer left in a patient's body using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detected in blood samples. This can help decide who needs more treatment after surgery. Even though many tests have been developed, it has yet to be determined which test performs best at relevant time points.\n\nThe GUIDE.MRD consortium is a group of experts, including scientists, technology, and pharmaceutical companies. The consortium is working on creating a reliable standard for the ctDNA tests, validating their clinical utility, and collecting data to help decide on the best treatment for each patient.\n\nFRENCH.MRD.CRLM is the French study and part of the european GUIDE.MRD project.",

Interventions: Peer PN (BEHAVIORAL); Pro PN (BEHAVIORAL). Sponsor: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Summary: Cancer health disparities related to race and ethnicity are among the most serious problems facing the US health care system. A recent institute of medicine report stated that such disparities are seen at every level of health care, from prevention to treatment and follow-up. This problem is acutely evident in the figures for colorectal cancer (CRC) among African Americans. According to the American cancer society, African Americans have the highest CRC incidence and mortality of any ethnic/racial group. Indeed, CRC incidence and mortality are 15% and 43% higher among African Americans than whites, respectively. These disparities could be effectively reduced through greater African American participation in CRC screening and early detection. More importantly, due to the preponderance of CRC in African Americans beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscopy (1), increased adherence to colonoscopy among African Americans will save lives. Although there is clear evidence that providing patients with someone to help them manage/navigate the health care system (i.e., patient navigation (PN)) is effective in helping them to complete cancer screening, very few hospitals provide PN for colonoscopy. The vast majority of hospitals in NYC are unable to provide PN for patients for whom colonoscopy is recommended, in large part because of the costs associated with professional-led PN. This project seeks to address this serious public health problem by investigating the success of training African Americans who have undergone colonoscopy to serve as volunteer peer patient navigators to encourage others from their community to complete CRC screening via colonoscopy.",

Conditions: Breast Cancer; Hodgkin Lymphoma. Sponsor: IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna. Summary: Italian Cancer Registry data show a steady increase in the number of cancer survivors due to advances in treatment. However, these treatments can impair ovarian function, causing premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Women with POI may experience vasomotor symptoms, infertility, psychological distress, and a significant reduction in quality of life. POI typically occurs before age 40 and is characterized by irregular menstruation and biochemical alterations (elevated gonadotropins and low estradiol). Chronic estrogen deficiency in POI is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, osteoporosis, psychological issues, and reproductive dysfunction.\n\nPreliminary studies suggest that chemotherapy-induced POI results from genetic changes in ovarian tissue, indicating a crucial role of genetic variations in individual susceptibility. Incidence rates of POI vary widely: about 38% after Hodgkin lymphoma and between 15% and 94% after breast cancer. Currently, there is no personalized pre-treatment risk assessment, complicating informed decision-making regarding ovarian function and fertility.\n\nFertility preservation options include ovarian tissue and oocyte cryopreservation. This study aims to compare the mutational status of DNA repair genes in ovarian tissue fragments from women who underwent ovarian cryopreservation and completed chemotherapy for lymphoma or breast cancer, categorized into those who developed POI and those who did not. Additionally, the mutational load of these genes will be compared between groups.\n\nThe study includes patients aged 18-38 who preserved ovarian tissue before gonadotoxic therapy between 2002 and 2024 at the IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Policlinico di S. Orsola. Two groups will be analyzed:\n\nGroup 1: Patients who developed POI after gonadotoxic treatment\n\nGroup 2: Patients who did not develop POI\n\nGroup assignment will be based on clinical and anamnesis data. Cryopreserved ovarian tissue from all participants will undergo advanced molecular analyses by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to assess germline and somatic mutational status and load. The genetic variant analysis, conducted in collaboration with the Computational Genomics Unit of IRCCS AOUBO, will focus on a panel of 26 DNA repair genes. Bioinformatic analysis will be performed using the Ion Reporter platform, with clinically relevant variants validated by orthogonal methods.\n\nThe study plans to enroll approximately 50 patients, 25 per group.",

Interventions: therapeutic estradiol (BIOLOGICAL); exemestane (DRUG); laboratory biomarker analysis (OTHER); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (OTHER). Sponsor: University of Arizona. Summary: RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of tumor cells. Hormone therapy using therapeutic estradiol may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Though estradiol initially produces stimulation of ER+ cancer cells, both laboratory and some clinical experience indicate that it may have the opposite effect on such cells, once they have become resistant to estrogen deprivation. In laboratory models, there is death of the \"resistant\" population after estradiol treatment, followed by restoration of sensitivity of the remaining cells to estrogen deprivation, as with an aromatase inhibitor. Exemestane may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving therapeutic estradiol together with exemestane may kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This clinical trial studies therapeutic estradiol and exemestane in treating post-menopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer",

Conditions: Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC); Esophageal Cancer, Squamous Cell. Interventions: Radiation: MRI guided radiotherapy (OTHER). Sponsor: UMC Utrecht. Summary: SUMMARY Rationale: Esophageal cancer (EC) is the seventh most frequently diagnosed cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. As a result of the late onset of symptoms, most patients with EC present in an advanced stage with a corresponding poor prognosis. Poor disease outcome after surgery alone (5-yr overall survival between 25-40%) prompted many researchers to explore neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) or neoadjuvant or perioperative chemotherapy (nCT/pCT) approaches. nCRT has led to pathological complete response (pCR) rate in squamous cell EC of almost 50%. Patients with a pCR have a favorable prognosis with 5-year OS \\>50%. In addition, patients who will achieve a pCR might be candidates for an organ preserving treatment strategy. Current standard nCRT consists of a relatively low dose of radiation compared to other tumors in the same area. The investigators hypothesize that increasing the dose of radiation will lead to increased local tumor control and pCR rates.\n\nObjective: The main objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2-fraction boost MRI-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) for patients with SCC following CROSS therapy. The secondary objectives are feasibility, non-dose limiting toxicity, oncological outcomes and to explore variables for early response evaluation.\n\nStudy design: 6+3 dose-escalation design with 3 radiotherapy dose levels. Study population: Patients with a resectable squamous cell esophageal carcinoma who are eligible for nCRT, surgery and MRgRT.\n\nIntervention: 2 sequential, homogenous boost fractions of 4-7 Gy on the gross tumor volume (GTV) in the week following CROSS using MR-guided online adaptive radiotherapy on the MR-linac. Start in dose level 0, of 2 x 5Gy boost per patient, and if safe this is increased step-wise to a maximum dose level 2 of 2 x 7Gy per patient.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the incidence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Early DLT is defined as radiation induced esophageal fistula/ perforation/ hemorrhage/ necrosis or tracheal, bronchial or bronchopleural fistula/tracheal or bronchopulmonary hemorrhage grade \u2265 3 or any non-hematological grade 4 toxicity according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 occurring within 14 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and before surgery or the postponing of surgery \\> 14 weeks after the end of radiotherapy due to any grade of treatment-related toxicity. Subacute DLT is defined as peri- and/or postoperative complications occurring within 30 days after surgery, defined as postoperative anastomotic leakage or pneumonitis \u2265 3b according to Clavien-Dindo. Secondary endpoints are non-DLT toxicity, the technical feasibility of dose delivery, perioperative complications, and oncological outcomes including R0 resection rate, histopathological tumor response, local and regional recurrence and death from any cause.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The benefits for the patients may include higher probability of complete pathological response that initially leads to increased survival and could eventually result in organ-sparing treatment programs. Compared to standard treatment, the CROSS regimen including the sequential boost will take 2 days extra in the final week of CROSS. Possible risks include higher radiation toxicity and surgical complication rates. However, it is expected this increase to be minor, for the investigators will use dose constraints on organs at risk, which are associated with low radiation-induced toxicity, and they will not be exceeded.",

The clinical benefit is based on the results of comprehensive assessment by the investigator in combination with imaging findings and clinical condition when the patient has no intolerable toxicity or the symptoms worsen due to disease progression.\n\nTumor assessments are performed at screening (as the baseline), every 6 weeks from the first dose in the first year, and every 9 weeks from the second year until radiologically documented progressive disease (PD), or second disease progression judged by the investigator (for patients with disease progression shown by first imaging, but who can continue treatment judged by the investigator), or withdrawal of informed consent by the patient, or loss to follow-up, or start of a new anti-tumor therapy, or the termination of the study. If a patient withdraws from the study for reasons other than disease progression (including due to the AE or because the treatment interval is beyond the window) and no disease progression occurs at the time of withdrawal, radiographic assessments should be continued until disease progression, death, or start of a new anti-tumor therapy. Patient medication management is based on the investigator's tumor assessment.",

Interventions: Telehealth Intervention (BEHAVIORAL); Standard of care (OTHER). Sponsor: City of Hope Medical Center. Summary: Over one million individuals in the U.S. have ostomies. An ostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening in the abdominal wall that allows bodily waste (urinary or fecal) to pass through into an external pouch; in essence, it is the externalization of the gastrointestinal or urinary structures to the abdominal wall. For cancer, ostomies are most commonly placed for rectal cancers, followed by urinary bladder cancer. The health-related quality of life impact of an ostomy is tremendous and greater than many other cancer treatments. The goal of this study is to pilot-test a perioperative ostomy self-management telehealth intervention (Periop-OSMT) in patients with colorectal and bladder cancer and their family caregivers. Participants will receive seven group telehealth sessions before and after ostomy surgery. This pilot clinical trial will study the feasibility of the methods/interventions and determine the preliminary efficacy to support a larger confirmatory trial.",

Interventions: Questionnaire and Physical Exam (OTHER). Sponsor: University Hospital, Montpellier. Summary: To date, there is a lack of data about the benefit of blood cell transfusions for patients diagnosed of a hematologic malignancy who are not eligible for curative treatments. Furthermore, there is no clear guideline about how to transfuse these patients and when the blood cell transfusions should be stopped.\n\nAllogenic stem cell transplantation is nowadays the only curative treatment for patients with high-risk myeloid neoplasms. Knowing that the median age at diagnostic for acute myeloid leukemia is 68 years and this incidence increases after 65 years, a lot of patients won't be eligible for allogenic stem cell transplantation.\n\nBesides, patients with haematologic malignancies are prone to cytopenias, due to their pathology and the treatments used to limit its progression. A study estimate that these patients need a median of 4 blood cell units per month, and it is known that repeated transfusions are associated with an increased risk of dying in hospital.\n\nFinally, it is estimate that there was a lack of 20 000 blood cell units in France in 2022.\n\nIt therefore seems essential to find ways to optimize blood transfusion prescriptions in this population of patients who won't be eligible for curative treatments, with the main idea of maintaining or even improving their quality of life.\n\nThe investigators will study the expectations of patients in palliative situation, paramedics and medical staff concerning blood cell transfusions, by asking them if whether or not they believe that the transfusion planed to be administer will benefit the patient. To do this, investigators will distribute questionnaires before each blood cell transfusions to patients who will be included, to the paramedic who administered the transfusion and to the physician who prescribed the transfusion.\n\nIt is to investigators knowledge the first study to compare the expectations of patients in palliative situation, paramedics and medical staff concerning blood cell transfusions in hematology department, and follow the evolution of these expectations prospectively.",

Summary: Objectives: This 3-year study aims to develop, refine, and evaluate a brief compassion-based intervention specifically designed for family caregivers of lung cancer patients. In the first year, the primary focus will be on developing the intervention content and assessing its feasibility and acceptability. In the second and third years, the goal will be to assess the intervention's effects on depression and anxiety.\n\nMethod: In the first year, the intervention will be developed in three stages. Initially, the intervention will be created based on compassion-focused theory and evidence-based exercises, incorporating feedback from family caregivers in previous studies and insights from professionals to ensure its relevance to lung cancer caregivers. Next, a pilot study will test the intervention's feasibility and acceptability with 30 family caregivers, using mixed methods to gather session-by-session feedback and assess recruitment, retention, and adherence. Following the pilot, the intervention will be revised based on participant and researcher feedback, preparing it for further study. In the second and third years, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted with 84 participants randomly assigned to either the 4-session Brief Compassion-Based Intervention (BCI) or a single-session Telephone-Based Support and Education (TSE) control group. Outcomes, including depression, anxiety, caregiver stress, mindfulness, self-compassion, and self-efficacy, will be measured at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. For data analysis, long-term follow-up quantitative data will be analyzed using the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) to examine group differences. Moderation and mediation analyses will be conducted to explore potential moderators and mechanisms of the intervention. Qualitative data from interviews will be analyzed using content analysis.\n\nExpected Results: This study is expected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of compassion-based interventions for lung cancer caregivers, contributing to their application in clinical care practice.",

Interventions: Tagged axillary metastatic node (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Institut Cancerologie de l'Ouest. Summary: Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) after NAC, aimed to reduce the rate of unnecessary axillary lymphadenectomy, is not a standard of care in case of patient with previously involved node before NAC because of a too high false negative rate (FNR).\n\nClinical consequences of FNR of SLND after NAC are currently unknown. Consequently, contrary to adjuvant setting, a risk of SLND false negative case after NAC is not acceptable.\n\nGANEA3 aims to evaluate the results of an innovative multiparametric strategy combining (1) an identification before chemotherapy of a lymph node involvement using a metal clip and then its analysis after treatment, (2) the analysis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) after NAC, and (3) analysis of biological parameters of breast tumor before and after NAC, to predict axillary status after NAC. This will identify patients with initial lymph node involvement who could benefit from SLN after NAC without additional axillary dissection with a very low FNR (\u22641%).\n\nThe most \"pathological\" metastatic lymph node will be identified with a metal clip under ultrasound. They will then receive a NAC before breast and axillary surgery. An assessment of the NAC response at the breast and axillary will be performed by imagery. Then, all patients undergo the resection of the tagged axillary node with the metal clip, SLN detection and biopsy and a complementary axillary lymphadenectomy.",

In a sub-group of participants, mitochondrial biogenesis and function and other molecular processes in skeletal muscle biopsies are studied. The women will be randomly allocated into three different intervention arms, a control arm with usual care and two different training arms. All participants will respond to questionnaires and have blood samples and taken and for a subgroup muscle biopsies before and after the exercise intervention. Participants will be supported to uphold exercise through collaboration with Friskis \\& Svettis and followed for 5 years. Some of the women will also be asked to participate in an in depth interview about the experiences of exercise during ongoing treatment. This study will contribute to increased knowledge about the type, intensity and frequency of training that patients with breast cancer benefit most from with regards to impact on physical and mental wellbeing. This knowledge is of great importance since experience shows that patients and relatives often seek information about rehabilitation, self-care and physical activity. The study will also contribute to the improvement of the patients\u00b4 quality of life, ability to return to work, and reduce social costs, but above all, increase the possibility for development and implementation of evidence-based rehabilitation of women with breast cancer during and after active treatment.",

Conditions: Low Grade Gliomas; Craniopharyngioma; Ependymomas; Meningiomas. Interventions: Stereotactic Conformal radiotherapy (RADIATION); Conventional radiotherapy (RADIATION). Sponsor: Tata Memorial Hospital. Summary: Brain tumours are the commonest solid tumours in children and the second most common neoplasms overall in this patient population. Radiotherapy plays an important part in the management in a majority of these tumours. While the cure rates of these tumours, especially the benign and low grade ones are quite encouraging, the treatment itself may lead to some late sequelae, which could have significant implications in the quality of life in these long-term survivors.\n\nStereotactic conformal radiotherapy (SCRT) is a modern high-precision radiotherapy technique, which reduces the volume of normal brain irradiated and has the capability to minimise the doses to critical structures. The present study is designed to prospectively estimate the incidence and severity of neuropsychological, cognitive and neuroendocrine dysfunction following radiotherapy delivered with conventional and stereotactic techniques and would be one of the most comprehensive studies providing very important longitudinal and reliable data regarding these sequelae. The study involving 200 patients would be to the best of our knowledge not only the largest ever study conducted so far but also the only randomised trial assessing these sequelae in patients receiving focal brain irradiation.\n\nThe study also examines whether the physical advantages of modern technological progress translate in clinical benefit. This could have significant implications in the radiotherapeutic management of children and young adults with brain tumours. The study is unique in design in terms of evaluating the efficacy of SCRT with respect to conventional radiotherapy in terms of long term tumour control and treatment related complications.",

Interventions: EFI (RADIATION); Pelvic RT (RADIATION). Sponsor: National Cancer Center, Korea. Summary: This study is an open-label, multi-institutional, randomized phase II study, which is designed to investigate the efficacy of Extended-field irradiation (EFI) on reducing recurrences at the para-aortic lymph node (PAN), and also on improving disease-free survival of locally advanced uterine cervical cancer. Radiotherapy is given as a conformal technique based on the individually taken CT scan and cisplatin is given concomitantly with radiotherapy in both EFI arm and pelvis only treatment arm. According to our past study result, patients with more hypoxic tumors are more likely to develop distant metastasis including the recurrences at PAN (1-3). This study started with examination of CA9 (hypoxia marker) expression in the primary cervical tumor before randomization because it was expected that there would be a differential benefit of EFI in patients with CA9-positive vs CA9-negative tumors. However, the study design was modified because there was too much delay in the patient with CA9-negative tumors. The patients are now registered and then immediately randomized to experimental (EFI) and control arm (pelvis only treated) with examination of CA9 expression at later time.",

Summary: This study will evaluate the impact InheRET\u2122, an online family history gathering and risk assessment reporting tool, has on facilitating National Comprehensive Cancer Network(NCCN) guideline compliant referrals for cancer genetic counseling/genetic evaluation by decreasing and/or removing the barriers of 1) time-consuming in-clinic 3-generation family history collection, and 2) interpretation of the family and personal history in light of current NCCN guidelines.\n\nIdentifying individuals at increased risk for cancer has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in multiple clinical settings. Investigators hypothesize that InheRET will prove to be accurate, efficient, and accessible, and that its use will improve identification of individuals at risk for inherited susceptibility to cancer. The investigators propose also that using this tool will result in a reduction of inappropriate genetic counseling referrals and reduce unnecessary genetic testing in both primary and specialty care settings. InheRET will allow health care providers to focus resources on individuals at higher risk for developing cancer.",

Sponsor: CHU de Reims. Summary: Hairy-cell leukemia is a rare and indolent lymphoid disorder, representing 2% of all cases of lymphoid leukemias. Treatment of hairy-cell leukemia relies mainly on the purine analogs, cladribine and pentostatin, which have shown similar efficacy and constitute the gold standard of care either as front-line therapy or for relapsed patients.\n\nHowever, despite the remarkable response rates obtained with purine analogs therapy, some patients will eventually relapse and the efficacy of these agents seems to decrease at each line of treatment. The addition of new molecules to purine analogs may improve the response rates and prevent relapse.\n\nRituximab is a chimeric IgG1 kappa-type monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 molecule. It was first used in relapsed patients with hairy-cell leukemia more than 10 years ago and several series of patients treated with rituximab as monotherapy were published in the following decade, reporting response rates ranging from 25% to 80%.",

Cyclophosphamide may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Giving vaccine therapy together with cyclophosphamide after surgery may cause a stronger immune response to kill any remaining tumor cells. It may also prevent or delay the recurrence of melanoma.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy when given with or without cyclophosphamide and to see how well they work in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage II, stage III, or stage IV melanoma.",

Collecting and storing samples of blood from patients with cancer to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well lycopene works in treating patients with prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia.",

Summary: The management of colorectal cancer often requires oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, either as part of curative treatment plans or exclusively in palliative situations. Oxaliplatin therefore plays a key role in the management of colorectal cancer. In addition to its digestive and hematological toxicity, oxaliplatin frequently induces chronic, often limiting, sensitive peripheral neuropathy.\n\nOnly early discontinuation of oxaliplatin can limit the risk of clinically limiting neurotoxicity (grade \u2265 3).\n\nIn oncology, managing the side-effects of treatment is an essential objective of supportive care, and is open to a variety of complementary medicines, including reflexology. This technique, derived from traditional Chinese medicine, involves stimulating reflex points on the arch of the foot.",

Sponsor: National Taiwan University Hospital. Summary: The best strategy to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) death lies in early detection and early treatment at the local disease status of tumor. After curative resection of tumor, there are about 5\\~10% of stage I, 20\\~30% of stage II and 40\\~50% of stage III patients suffering metastasis during subsequent follow-up periods. Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most widely used biomarker for postoperative monitoring of recurrence on asymptomatic patients, it is difficult to use CEA as biological marker to identify the population with high recurrent risk in patients with early-stage cancer because lower than half of patients with early-stage cancer do not have CEA elevation. For improving the survival of patients with early-stage CRC, we need effort to search more useful biological markers to predict the risk of tumor recurrence and to select out patients with high recurrent risk to receive preventive adjuvant therapy.\n\nCirculating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood play an essential role in cancer metastasis. Hence, the detection of CTCs and subsequent analysis can potentially revolutionize the cancer care ranging from screening, diagnosis, monitoring, to drug selection and so on. In the past decade, many methods using magnetic beads (CellSearch), filtration (RareCelletc), or flow cytometry have been developed but all of them have the shortcomings from low sensitivity, low purity, to unable to retrieve cells for downstream molecular analysis and cell culture. Recently, a biomimetic affinity based microfluidic platform has overcome abovementioned technical challenges. Importantly, by using only 2 ml of peripheral blood, Sinica's team has shown that the enumeration of CTCs increases with the CRC disease progression, where the mean CTC counts are 3, 15, 29 and 60 per ml for the stages I, II, III and IV, respectively. The results imply that monitoring CTC enumeration serially may serve as a prediction marker to identify the CRC patients with high probability of recurrence. The aims of this study are toestablishing CTC platform standard operation protocol (SOP) that leads to certification of ISO 13485 and to establish CTC criteria and evaluate its prediction power of early detection of colorectal cancer recurrence.",

Summary: While several studies have been reported with increasing doses of daunorubicin in the first line treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), there is no similar experience with idarubicin as initial treatment of AML.\n\nAs idarubicin is the most common treatment used for AML, it is needed to find the optimal dose for the combination of idarubicin, cytarabine and G\\_CSF, to explore if this combination improves the outcomes of current treatments for AML.\n\nThe aim of this dose-finding study is to find the optimal dose for the combination of idarubicin, cytarabine and G-CSF that could improve the response rate, reduce relapse and improve survival of patients with primary acute myeloid leukemia. This could be a significant advance in a field where treatment outcomes have stabilized in the last 15 years. This study will be the basis for further prospective, randomized, multicenter trial comparing idarubicin maximum tolerated dose, compared to standard treatment with idarubicin and cytarabine, including raising both arms in G-CSF. The dose of 12 mg/m2 will be administered as control arm in this future randomized study, which will investigate the benefit of enhanced dose identified as optimal in this phase II pilot study.",

Sponsor: Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. Summary: Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Due to the shortage of donor organs and the risk of tumor recurrence after transplantation, the restrictive Milan criteria is the standard guideline for liver transplantation (LT) in patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis. The XXL study (Mazzaferro et al, 2020) is the first prospective trial validating that effective and sustained downstage therapy could expand the selection criteria and improve the prognosis of recipients with HCC beyond Milan criteria. However, the optimal DT protocol is poorly defined, especially in the Asian population. Recently, immunotherapies such as immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are revolutionizing the management of advanced HCC, the combination of the ICI and other treatment regimens (Anti-VEGF, locoregional therapies et al) produced superior results in patients with advanced-stage HCC compared to those with traditional therapeutic regimens. Therefore, we hypothesize an intensive downstage regimen containing immunotherapy could expand the selection criteria for HCC LT",

Summary: Endometrial cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in our means. The diagnosis is made by endometrial biopsy sampling with anatomopathological analysis which pinpoints the cell line and the level of cell differentiation. Its treatment is surgical with adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) besides, depending on the staging. Thus far, in the first diagnosis it is only request the tumor marker CA125 in serum, but there are studies that identify the HE4 protein in blood as a feasible marker for endometrial cancer. Furthermore, the staging changes the surgical and the adjuvant treatment: in its early stages, surgery is based on hysterectomy and double adnexectomy, however, in later stages it is necessary to add pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy with the associated comorbidity. This makes extremely important that the preoperative diagnosis is accurate. The aim of this study is to identify and characterize the HE4, Ki67, p53 and other potential biomarkers in endometrial tissue in order to diagnose patients with disease only with a biopsy. Moreover, the investigators are searching for connections among these markers and prognostic factors such as grade of cell differentiation, cell line, lymphatic affectation, tumor stage or even features as survival or disease free survival.",

Sponsor: Seoul National University Hospital. Summary: Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite advances in therapeutic intervention, the mortality from this disease remains high. As a result, most patients are now offered varying combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy in order to derive benefits from a multidisciplinary approach. Unfortunately, therapies are often toxic or debilitating and therapeutic responses can vary. Thus new therapeutic strategy is required for the treatment of gastric cancer.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the discovery of cytolytic T cells (cytolytic T lymphocytes, CTLs) directed against an antigen presented on tumor cells was published. They can kill many invasive cells by recognizing the tumor specific antigens on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. It is now generally agreed that although tumors express tumor antigens, they usually lack immunogenicity because of their inability to activate the immune response. The current view is that tumor cells are antigenic, but not immunogenic. If we can artificially activate the immune system against the tumor, it may be possible to eradicate the tumor. This approach is the basis of cancer immunotherapy.\n\nMany tumor antigens have been defined in terms of multiple solid tumors: MART-1/Melan-A, gp100, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), HER-2, mucins (i.e., MUC-1), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) are just a short list. Some immune-based therapies targeting these tumor antigens are in phase III trials assessing whether immunizing against these antigens affects overall survival. In gastric cancer, some tumor antigens such as MAGE-A3, NY-ESO-1, and WT-1 have been reported to be expressed in substantial proportion of cases. They have the potential to be the targeting molecules for immunotherapy in the future. In this study, we aim to explore the expression levels of the four tumor markers (MAGE-A3, NY-ESO-1, WT-1 and PRAME) in gastric cancers of Korean patients and to examine the correlations of the expression levels of the four markers to clinic-patholoical factors.",

Summary: The standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is surgery, such as, by hepatic resection or liver transplantation, but less than 20% of HCC patients are suitable for surgery. In the remaining patients with inoperable and advanced HCC, trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) has been widely used but TACE alone rarely produces complete response and commonly develops recurrence. Recently several small studies reported high tumor response and local control rate after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) alone or with TACE for inoperable HCC. This study will evaluate SABR effect with 60 Gy in 3 fractionations for HCC with size of \u2264 5 cm and 3 cm apart from gastrointestinal tract.",

Sponsor: National Cancer Institute (NCI). Summary: Background:\n\nThe National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with melanoma that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying them, and then giving the cells back to the patient. In a previous study, the NCI Surgery Branch used the anti-ESO-1 gene and a type of virus (retrovirus) to make these tumor-fighting cells (anti-ESO-1 cells). About half of the patients who received this treatment experienced shrinking of their tumors. In this study, we are using a slightly different method of producing the anti-ESO-1 cells selected for a specific cell type, which we hope, will be better in making the tumors shrink.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified cells) that express the receptor for the ESO-1 molecule on their surface can cause melanoma tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.\n\nEligibility:\n\n-Adults 18 and older with cancer that has the ESO-1 molecule on tumor surfaces\n\nDesign:\n\n* Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed\n* Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}\n* Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-ESO 1 cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.\n\nFollow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.",

Sponsor: Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. Summary: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a heterogeneous group of cancers arising from the epithelial cells of bile ducts. Because of highly aggressive malignancy, most of the patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage and lose the chance to undergo surgery. As more effective and novel chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy become available, multiple treatments can be chosen for the patients with advanced CCA. Cytotoxic cell death during tumor chemotherapy triggers antigen release and induces strong anti-tumor effects of T cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) can reduce the expression of PD-L1 and inhibit Treg cell infiltration, and together with immune checkpoint inhibitors, they can relieve tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore,we aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib, tislelizumab combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GPLET) in the treatment of advanced cholangiocarcinoma.",

Conditions: Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Interventions: Upadacitinib (DRUG); Vedolizumab (DRUG). Sponsor: Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University. Summary: It's of great importance to effectively induce and maintain disease remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Vedolizumab (VDZ) is known for its high safety profile and confirmed therapeutic efficacy in UC treatment. However, according to the experience in clinical practice, the effect onset speed of vedolizumab is relatively slow. Upadacitinib (UPA), however, works quickly, which complements the defect of slow onset of VDZ induction. However, the safety of UPA used in situations such as infection and tumors is inferior to that of VDZ, and long-term use requires testing for the risk of adverse events such as deep vein thrombosis. Therefore, if the advantages of long-term maintenance therapy safety of VDZ and rapid induced remission of UPA are fully utilized, the combination of VDZ and UPA induction for 8 weeks, followed by the use of single drug VDZ in maintenance therapy, can maximize the clinical benefits of UC patients. Due to the lack of high-level clinical research data at home and abroad, we plan to conduct a multicenter prospective randomized controlled clinical study to provide the evidence-based basis for the efficacy analysis of the sequential treatment of moderate to severe UC patients with VDZ and UPA.",

Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Plerixafor is a drug that may prevent recurrence of glioblastoma after radiation treatment. Giving whole brain radiation therapy with standard temozolomide chemo-radiotherapy and plerixafor may work better in treating patients with glioblastoma.",

Status: RECRUITING. Phase: NA. Conditions: Lung Cancer; Non Small Cell Lung Cancer. Interventions: NodeAI (DIAGNOSTIC_TEST); Surgeon (DIAGNOSTIC_TEST). Sponsor: St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton. Summary: Lung cancer is the leading cause of annual cancer deaths globally, more than breast, prostate, and colon cancers combined. The staging of chest lymph nodes (LNs) is a crucial step in the lung cancer diagnostic pathway because it aids in treatment decisions - whether a patient is a candidate for lung resection, chemotherapy, radiation, or multimodal treatments. Endobronchial Ultrasound Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is the current standard for chest nodal staging for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and guidelines mandate that Systematic Sampling (SS) of at least 3 chest LN stations be routinely performed for accurate staging. Unfortunately, EBUS-TBNA yields inaccurate results in 40% of patients, leading to misinformed treatment decisions. This proportion is much higher in patients with Triple Normal LNs \\[LNs that appear normal on computed tomography (CT) scans, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and EBUS\\], which have been found to have a \\> 93% chance of being truly benign. This is because EBUS-TBNA is based on ultrasound, whose success highly depends on the skill of the person performing it (operator). When the operator makes an error, the entire procedure is jeopardized. This causes downstream delays in treatment due to repeated testing and ill-informed treatment decisions.\n\nOver the past decade, the investigator has been conducting a series of research studies and trials: the development and validation of the Canada Lymph Node Score (CLNS) - a surgeon-derived semi-quantitative measure of LN malignancy; an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based version of the CLNS to predict malignancy; and a fully autonomous AI that learned to predict malignancy directly from ultrasound images, to introduce AI to the decision-making pathway in NSCLC. This resulted in the creation of an AI-powered software to predict malignancy in mediastinal LNs of patients with lung cancer. The software is currently housed in cloud storage and its applications are latent - which means that LN images must be uploaded to the software, and results are received at a future time. In its current form, the software is not ready for clinical application due to this latency. In this project, the investigator aims to build a point-of-care device which will house the software (NodeAI) and deliver real-time results to the surgeon, and this device will be tested in a clinical trial.",

Interventions: Granulocytes (BIOLOGICAL). Sponsor: University of Manchester. Summary: Although most children with leukaemia are cured using drugs (chemotherapy) alone, for some children additional treatments are needed. Stem cell transplant can cure children where chemotherapy and other drugs have failed. In this case, the immune cells of the donor attack the leukaemia cells of the patient. Cord blood collected from the placenta of unrelated babies is often used as a donor cell source and appears to work well at controlling leukaemia and less likely to cause complications such as when the immune cells also mistakenly attack healthy tissues (called graft versus host disease, GVHD).\n\nThe investigators have noticed that during cord blood transplant, the donor immune system appears to recover more quickly and not be associated with GVHD, when a type of blood transfusion containing white cells are also given to the patient. The infused white cells appear to stimulate the donor immune cells to expand much more than usually seen.\n\nDuring this research, the investigators will study this immune cell expansion during cord blood transplant in children with difficult-to-cure leukaemia who also receive a transfusion of white cells, termed granulocytes. The investigators will assess the safety of the effects of the white cell transfusions and the immune cell expansion on the child, and look at the outcomes on the patient's leukaemia, and whether there is GVHD or not.",

Microwave ablation is designed to kill tumor cells by heating the tumor until the tumor cells die. A wedge resection is a procedure that involves the surgical removal of a small, wedge-shaped piece of lung tissue to remove a small tumor or to diagnose lung cancer. Comparing these two treatment options may help researchers learn which method works better for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic sarcoma, and metastatic colorectal cancer.",

Summary: This phase I trial studies the side effects of image-guided hyper-fractioned proton therapy in treating patients with head and neck cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Radiation therapy uses high energy protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. The change in dose radiation frequency and dose investigated in this study may help to better control the tumor and prevent it from coming back or growing. The goal of this study is to test a new radiation schedule that administers more radiation to the tumor tissue using image guided proton therapy for patients that have a high risk of having a tumor recurrence (the tumor comes back after treatment).",

Summary: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects of self-applied acupressure on arthralgia-fatigue-sleep disturbance symptom cluster in breast cancer survivors receiving aromatase inhibitors. This is a preliminary randomized controlled trial, with a three-arm trial design including verum self-acupressure, sham self-acupressure, and usual care. Subjects will include 52 breast cancer survivors who are receiving aromatase inhibitors and have experienced a moderate level of joint pain and at least one of the two symptoms including fatigue and sleep disturbance. Subjects who are randomized to either the verum self-acupressure group (group A) or the sham self-acupressure group (group B) will receive up to 8 weeks of the intervention consisting of two components: (1) two individual/group acupressure training sessions over 2 weeks and (2) self-acupressure for 6 weeks. The method and duration of self-acupressure in the sham group will be the same to those in the verum intervention group. The control group will receive usual care. The outcome measures of this study will be related to feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects of self-acupressure. Individual in-depth interviews will be conducted with selected participants in group A and B to understand their perceptions and perceived effectiveness of the intervention.",

Sponsor: Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. Summary: RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, and radiation therapy before a donor bone marrow or stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus after transplant may stop this from happening.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying cyclophosphamide and/or mycophenolate mofetil with or without tacrolimus to see which is the best regimen in treating patients who are undergoing a donor bone marrow or stem cell transplant for hematologic cancer.",

Summary: RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can find cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as busulfan and cyclophosphamide, before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving tacrolimus and methotrexate after the transplant may stop this from happening.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the best dose of alemtuzumab when given together with busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed by a donor stem cell transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with hematologic cancer.",

Interventions: receive dissolved form of BIKTARVY\u00ae (DRUG); receive crushed form of BIKTARVY\u00ae (DRUG); receive solid form of BIKTARVY\u00ae (DRUG). Sponsor: University Hospital, Caen. Summary: Study context:\n\nSome HIV-positive patients have difficulties with oral administration of antiretroviral drugs, such as children and adults suffering from ENT cancer. It is therefore necessary to offer these patients an alternative: administering the triple therapy in a liquid or well crushed form would be alternatives to a solid tablet, conditional on demonstrating their bioequivalence and that they are well tolerated (taste in particular).\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe investigator's primary intention is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of each of the three active ingredients in Biktarvy\u00ae (single daily tablet made up of a set combination of tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine/bictegravir: TAF/FTC/BIC) by administering the drug in the forms of a complete and solid tablet (phase S), a tablet dissolved in water (phase D) or a tablet crushed and suspended in apple compote (phase C). The secondary objectives are to compare the safety, tolerance (taste in particular) and preference of healthy volunteers after administration of Biktarvy\u00ae, depending on the three methods of oral administration.\n\nEquipment and methods:\n\nThis is a phase I, monocentric, open, three-period, randomised, cross-over trial that will be conducted with 18 healthy volunteers (9 men, 9 women) above the age of 18 in a French university hospital (Caen University Hospital - CHU de Caen). The healthy volunteers will be randomised to receive three different forms (solid, dissolved or crushed) in a varying order, according to the randomisation, at an interval of 14 to 28 days. After each of the three doses, the volunteers will be hospitalised for 24 hours and will then return three times to carry out the pharmacokinetic study with samples taken at the following times: 0 h (right before taking Biktarvy\u00ae); 0.5 h; 1 h; 1.5 h; 2 h; 2.5 h; 3 h; 4 h; 8 h; 12 h; 24 h; 36 h; 48 h and 72 h (after Biktarvy\u00ae).\n\nThe plasma concentration in antiretroviral drugs will be analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (QTRAP 5500, Sciex, Les Ulis, France) at Orl\u00e9ans Regional Hospital (CHR d'Orl\u00e9ans). The bioequivalence between administration methods D or C will be demonstrated if the confidence interval at 90% (CI 90%) of the ratio parameters Cmax, AUC0-72h and AUC0-\u221e is included in the 80%-125% range of those obtained for administration method S and for the three active ingredients.\n\nHypothesis tested:\n\nOral administration of Biktarvy\u00ae tablets dissolved in water (as a liquid solution) or crushed and administered in an apple compote is bioequivalent to the solid form (entire tablet swallowed with water) with regard to the three active ingredients that make up Biktarvy\u00ae. This means that these methods could be offered to patients who have difficulties with swallowing tablets. Preliminary data must be obtained using healthy volunteers.",

Sponsor: National Cheng-Kung University Hospital. Summary: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the major cause of gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer in adults. Bismuth-based quadruple therapy is recommended by a recent review to be the first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication, replacing clarithromycin-based triple therapy. It is because the eradication rates of triple therapy in adults have declined due to increasing clarithromycin resistance. The best regimen for H. pylori eradication should be the one which succeeds on the first attempt. However, the effectiveness and the optimal duration of bismuth-based quadruple therapy for first-line H. pylori eradication in adults are unknown. Moreover, the impacts on gut microbiota after H. pylori eradication should be concerned; for example, bismuth-based quadruple therapy decreases F. prausnitzii richness. The transient perturbation of the gut microbiota after H. pylori eradication were restored at 8 weeks and one year in subjects receiving clarithromycin-based triple therapy but not fully recovered in those receiving bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Therefore, the important issues are that the short-term and long-term gut dysbiosis and the recovery of gut F. prausnitzii depletion in H. pylori-infected adult patients after bismuth-based quadruple therapy. It is also uncertain the role of irreversible gut dysbiosis even though H. pylori is eradicated in gastric persist inflammation and progress to cancer, and whether probiotics could be helpful in recovering gut dysbiosis.\n\nThe therapeutic strategy to eradicate H. pylori infection is based on antibiotics; however, this strategy not only increases drug resistant rates of the pathogen but also shapes the gut microbiota.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that bismuth-based quadruple therapy could be an optimal regimen for first-line H. pylori eradication in the era of increasing clarithromycin resistance; moreover, gut dysbiosis could be reversed after bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Furthermore, the efficacy of the10-day course is not inferior to that of the 14-day course in H. pylori eradication. The investigators also hypothesize that probiotics could restore gastric or gut dysbiosis, especially gut F. prausnitzii depletion.",

Summary: Despite broad awareness of the role that diet plays in increasing obesity risk, adherence to public health recommendations for maintaining healthy eating is low. Insights gained from weight loss intervention trials find that trial participants report difficulty in restricting calories, dissatisfaction with the pace of weight loss, inability to control eating, low palatability of recommended foods and strong food cravings. Indeed, recent systematic reviews provide empirical support that these subjective experiences that trial participants describe likely represent eating-related traits or phenotypes . While amassing evidence supports individual variation in these eating-related traits, to date there has been no systematic effort to characterize robust eating-related phenotypes. Proposed is a Sub-study initially planned to be piggy-backed on a planned Study being conducted by investigators at the University of North Carolina (UNC-- Linnan, Dilworth- Anderson \\& Evans). The UNC Parent Study was a feasibility study using community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches to explore possible intervention strategies aimed to reduce the burden of chronic disease and cancer among African American families. The NHGRI-led eating behavior Sub-study is proposed to be integrated with the UNC Parent Study (hereafter referred to as Phase 1). The additional aims of the Sub-study (hereafter referred to as Phase 2) are to gain understanding of whether we can characterize clusters of eating-related behaviors that may be associated with adherence to weight management and weight outcomes. This current protocol lays out the specific qualitative activities planned for Phase 1 which include conducting structured interviews with Black Family Reunion organizers (N=8) and a sample of reunion participants (N=40). We also describe the larger quantitative survey proposed for Phase 2. Pending the feasibility of the sub-study with the African-American community, we will collect information on eating-related behaviors in a large sample of individuals (N=350). If the initial assessments (Phase1) prove that this is not a viable study to be conducted in that setting, we will consider other population groups and other settings.\n\nWe are also considering Phase 3 activities if we identify clusters of eating-related phenotypes within individuals. Amended IRB applications will be submitted prior to launching Phase 3.",

Conditions: Multiple Myeloma; Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma; Hodgkins Disease. Interventions: G-CSF plus Plerixafor (DRUG). Sponsor: Duke University. Summary: Plerixafor, administered at a dose of 240 ug/kg, potentiates the effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to increase peripheral blood progenitor cells in both healthy volunteers and cancer patients. Furthermore, in cancer patients, cells collected via apheresis using Plerixafor and G-CSF have been successfully transplanted. In December 2008, Plerixafor received approval from the Food and Drug administration for use in combination with G-CSF to aid in mobilization of progenitor cells for apheresis. The proposed study is not designed to support approval of a new indication or change in the advertising for Plerixafor. The route of administration and dosage level are identical to that which is listed on the package insert. Although Plerixafor is not approved for patients with Hodgkins Lymphoma, there is no known or theoretic increased risk of the use of this drug in this patient population.\n\nThe study hypothesis for this study is that patients with a circulating CD34+ count \\< 20 cells/ul after 5 days of mobilization with G-CSF alone will achieve \\> or equal to 2 X 10(6)CD34+ cells/kg within 3 days of apheresis after receiving Plerixafor with G-CSF.",

Interventions: Liver resection Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) (PROCEDURE); Liver resection with the harmonic scalpel (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Sohag University. Summary: Evaluation Of Liver Resection Using Harmonic Scalpel Versus Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA)\n\nIntroduction The mode of parenchymal transection in hepatic resection has been a topic of great debate for decades. Many resections have now evolved into laparoscopic , and robotic-assisted procedures to limit morbidity. Morbidity and mortality after hepatic resection has progressively improved over the years due to improved equipment, operative technique \\[3\\], and anesthetic management. Prior to 1980, mortality rates were reported to be in the 10-20% range with many deaths related to perioperative hemorrhage. Now perioperative mortality has dropped significantly to approximately 5%.\n\nThe clamp-crush technique, first reported in 1974, has been used for decades and remains the standard means of parenchymal division for many surgeons. Control of intraoperative hemorrhage has been one of the principle technical problems in advancing liver surgery. Excess blood loss and intraoperative blood transfusions have been shown to be associated with increased perioperative mortality and morbidity including an increased rate of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence . Transfusions are also associated with increased infections and with increased cost. Costs of blood transfusions were recently examined in surgical patients.\n\nMany devices are now available to surgeons for division of the liver parenchyma in both open and minimally invasive surgery including: the CUSA (Tyco Healthcare, Mansfield, MA), Harmonic Scalpel (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA), Ligasure (Valley Lab, Tyco Healthcare, Boulder, CO, USA), Tissue Link (Salient Surgical Technologies, Portsmouth, NH), water-jet dissection, radiofrequency, microwave assisted resection, vascular staplers, and others In this study, we looked at the TissueLink bipolar sealer device that was used in combination with the CUSA in group 1 termed the CUSA/TissueLink group, and the Harmonic Scalpel in the group 2 termed Harmonic Scalpel/TissueLink. The TissueLink uses radiofrequency energy focused near the end of the device for electrocautery and a low volume saline drip that produces ohmic heat causing precoagulation of hepatic parenchyma. The saline keeps the temperature at or below 100 C to avoid eshcar formation ultimately helping prevent delayed biliary leak and hemorrhage. The hemostatic effects of TissueLink are a result of its disruption of the collagen in blood vessels causing closing of the lumen .\n\nThe CUSA, a commonly used device in hepatic resection, was used in combination with the TissueLink in this study. We previously described this combination of devices reporting a shorter length of hospital stay, decreased operative time, and decreased intraoperative blood transfusion . CUSA uses ultrasonic energy to fragment and aspirate parenchymal tissue. This exposes biliary as well as vascular structures that may then be closed in a variety of ways at the surgeon's discretion. It allows for a precise transection plane allowing preservation of normal hepatic tissue .\n\nThe Harmonic Scalpel, used in this study in combination with the TissueLink, utilizes ultrasonic vibration of two blades causing destruction of hydrogen bonds. This disruption of hydrogen bonds causes protein denaturization coagulating small vessels of 3 mm diameter. The parenchyma is also cut when the blades move in a saw-like fashion In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of two different techniques described above for the division of the hepatic parenchyma in order to improve perioperative outcomes.",

Conditions: Gastric Cancer. Interventions: Capecitabine monotherapy (DRUG). Sponsor: The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. Summary: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and lethal malignancies in Asia. For early (stage T1) GC, it has been found by analyzing surgical specimens that \\~5% of cancers have lymph node metastasis. For patients with stage T2-3N0M0 GCs, there is a considerable probability of micro-metastasis. While the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association (JGCA), and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines recommend adjuvant therapy for most patients with resected \\>T1N0 GCs, the recommendations vary regarding postsurgical treatment for patients with stage T1N+M0 or T2-3N0M0 disease. The JGCA guidelines do not recommend postsurgical chemotherapy for this patient population, while the ESMO support the adjuvant treatment. The NCCN has not offered a definitive recommendation on this issue. Through careful literature search, there is not yet randomized report on whether postsurgical chemotherapy benefits survival for patients with resected T1N+M0 or T2-3N0M0 GC. The first-line chemotherapy regimen for GC is fluorouracil plus platinum. Among fluorouracil, platinum is especially favored due to its less frequent and less severe adverse effects. This large multicenter phase III randomized controlled trial is led by Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and carried out in multiple Chinese centers, aiming to compare the safety and efficacy of capecitabine monotherapy versus no therapy in the adjuvant setting for patients with stage T1N+M0 or T2-3N0M0 GC undergoing R0 Resection.",

Interventions: PET Imaging (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Ontario Clinical Oncology Group (OCOG). Summary: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women. Although overall survival remains poor, early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is potentially curable. Improved staging has led to stage-specific therapies such that patients with early stage NSCLC are potential candidates for surgical resection, and those with more advanced disease are spared the morbidity and risk of mortality from thoracotomy and pulmonary resection. Despite contemporary staging techniques, 25-50% of patients who appear to have limited disease amenable to surgical resection go on to die from metastatic lung cancer. If occult micro-metastatic disease that becomes evident later could be detected reliably during the pre-operative assessment, patients harboring such disease could be spared a non-curative thoracotomy. PET imaging has the potential to detect mediastinal and extrathoracic metastatic disease not detected by conventional imaging modalities.\n\nThis prospective, multicenter trial will enroll patients with biopsy-proven clinical stage I-IIIA NSCLC who are considered to be candidates for surgical resection with curative intent. Preoperatively, patients will be randomized to conventional staging for metastatic disease (CT liver/adrenals, total body bone scan, and CT with contrast or MRI with gadolinium of the brain) versus whole body PET or PET-CT and brain CT or MRI with contrast/gadolinium.",

Sponsor: National Cancer Institute (NCI). Summary: The Columbia, MO Serum Bank initially was established in 1977 as part of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Biological Markers Project to identify serum markers for breast cancer. Participants were volunteers identified through the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP) at the University of Missouri Hospital and Ellis Fischel Cancer Center in Columbia, MO. A total of 6,915 women without a prior history of cancer, other than non-melanoma skin cancer, donated blood to the bank on one or more occasions between 1977 and 1987.\n\nAt the time of each blood collection, interview information was obtained including age, height, weight, reproductive and menstrual histories, family history of breast cancer, medical conditions, and drug use, including oral contraceptives and menopausal hormone therapy. Date of last menstrual period was captured for women who were premenopausal at the time of each blood collection. Approximately 30% of the women donated multiple samples over the first 10 years of the study, (including 20% with 3 or more samples), with collections occurring on average one year apart. At each collection, serum was aliquoted into up to ten, 1 ml vials and stored at -70 (Infinite)C at the NCI Repository. All women gave informed consent before donating to the serum bank.\n\nThe initial follow-up continued for up to 12 years through 1989, with 244 cancers identified. Of the 6915 original participants, 79% were last seen in 1983 or earlier, yielding a median follow-up time of 4 years. A questionnaire was mailed to all participants annually to ascertain information on interim breast biopsies and cancer diagnoses. Women who indicated that they had a breast biopsy or breast cancer were sent a consent form for permission to obtain medical records including pathology reports. For cancers at sites other than the breast, medical records and pathology reports were not requested, although date of diagnosis and site were ascertained.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2002, an extended follow-up of Columbia, MO Serum Bank participants was conducted. Of the 6915 original participants, 6,720 women had blood remaining and were included in this phase of the study. Of these, 6,154 (91.6%) were located; 566 (8%) were not locatable, 109 (2%) refused to participate, and 40 (\\<1%) were too ill to participate. 1,694 women (25%) were deceased. This last follow-up identified an additional 1123 cancers. This cohort has serum samples from a cohort of 6720 pre- and postmenopausal women followed up to 20 years for cancer diagnoses and is a unique resource for molecular epidemiologic studies exploring serum markers associated with cancer risk.",

Sponsor: AHS Cancer Control Alberta. Summary: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a specialised nuclear medicine procedure that uses positron emitting radiolabeled tracer molecules to measure biological activity. The most common of these radiolabeled tracers is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), which is used to determine abnormal glucose metabolism in tumours and other sites. It has general applications in all areas where abnormal glucose metabolism may be present including in circumstances such as differentiating the tumour from scar tissue; evaluating the presence of the tumour in light of rising tumour markers and normal morphological imaging techniques; and assessing response to therapy where other techniques are deemed to be unhelpful. The Cross Cancer Institute (CCI) has recently been funded to establish a PET centre, and this study will prove the effectiveness of PET scanning in the Canadian health care environment and validate the data that have been developed in other jurisdictions in specific oncologic indications.",

Interventions: Physical training (BEHAVIORAL). Sponsor: Karolinska Institutet. Summary: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is increasingly used in breast cancer. The best proof of NACT efficacy is pathological complete response (pCR), i.e. the absence of invasive tumour on post-NACT surgical histopathology. While it is known that physical exercise can help patients to better tolerate and complete often harsh cancer treatments, it is an emerging area of research to understand if and how exercise exerts anti-tumour effects and improves oncological outcomes.\n\nThe main aim of the Neo-ACT trial is to examine if a physical exercise intervention during NACT can increase pCR rates in breast cancer. Secondary aims are residual cancer burden, radiological tumour response, patient-related outcomes (health-related quality of life, physical activity), physiological outcomes (muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness), cancer treatment-related toxicities (cognitive dysfunction, chemotherapy completion rates) and long-term sick leave. Furthermore, the trial will explore how physical exercise affects anti-tumoral mechanisms inherent to therapy or host by hypothesis-generating translational analyses.\n\n712 patients with primary invasive breast cancer will be randomized to either a supervised intervention of high-intensity interval and resistance training during NACT, supported by an exercise app, or to usual care, and followed for two years. Physical activity is meticulously tracked. By offering patients active involvement, the trial contributes strongly to the concept of personalized medicine.",

Summary: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of conversion therapy combined with radical gastrectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy targeting para-aortic (station 16) lymph nodes in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and isolated station 16 nodal metastases. Eligible participants must have no evidence of peritoneal dissemination, visceral metastases, or non-regional lymphatic spread. Based on PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS), patients in the experimental arm will receive systemic therapy with SOX (S-1 plus oxaliplatin) with or without a PD-1 inhibitor, followed by D2 gastrectomy and postoperative adjuvant SOX chemotherapy, then intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to the para-aortic region. The control arm will receive standard chemotherapy with CAPEOX or SOX, with or without immunotherapy, according to CPS status. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety.

Interventions: Lansoprazole (DRUG); Amoxicillin (DRUG); Clarithromycin (DRUG). Sponsor: Mackay Memorial Hospital. Summary: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most common chronic bacterial infection in humans.\n\nThe prevalence of H. pylori is about 30\\~50% in the Western adult population. It is estimated that about 50% of people are infected with this bacterium in Taiwan. Many studies have shown that H. pylori is an important causal factor of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma. The World Health Organization classified H. pylori as a Group 1 carcinogen in 1994. Endoscopic examination is indicated to confirm the above diagnosis for patient with H. pylori infection. Eradication of H. pylori infection reduces the risk of gastric cancer and recurrence of peptic ulcer disease. However, the eradication rate of clarithromycin-based triple therapy has been declining in recent years, probably related to the increasing resistant rate to clarithromycin. Several strategies have been proposed to overcome the declining eradication rate, including (1) extending the treatment duration of triple therapy to 14 days; (2) the use of bismuth quadruple therapy which contains bismuth, a proton pump inhibitor, and two antibiotics (usually metronidazole and tetracycline); (3) non-bismuth quadruple therapy (concomitant therapy) which contains a proton pump inhibitor and three antibiotics (usually amoxicillin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin); (4) sequential therapy which contains a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus amoxicillin for five days, followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin and tinidazole for another five days. The investigators aim to improve the eradication rate of H. pylori infection while an endoscopic examination is performed.",

    "search_text": "Clinical trial: A Prospective, Multicenter, Multicohort Phase II Study: Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Preoperative Neoadjuvant Treatment With a PD-1 Inhibitor in Combination With Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Laryngeal and Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING. Phase: PHASE2. Conditions: Head and Neck Cancers. Interventions: Pembrolizumab (DRUG); Cisplatin (DRUG); Nab-paclitaxel (DRUG). Sponsor: Beijing Tongren Hospital. Summary: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) refers to a series of tumors that occur in the head and neck region, including the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, thyroid gland, and salivary glands. Malignant tumors of the head and neck account for approximately 19.9% to 30.2% of all tumors in the body, ranking sixth in incidence among all malignant tumors, with over 90% being squamous cell carcinoma in terms of pathological type. The treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is primarily surgical. Early-stage cases can achieve a cure through simple surgical resection or radiotherapy. For locally advanced and late-stage cases, a combination of surgery with radiotherapy or chemotherapy can yield satisfactory therapeutic effects. However, most patients with head and neck tumors present at a locally advanced (Stage III to IVB) or late stage, possibly having lost the opportunity for surgery and can only opt for a comprehensive treatment mainly based on radiochemotherapy. Current data show that with standard treatment, the 5-year survival rates for patients with early-stage, locally advanced, and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are 80%, 50%, and 25%, respectively. Fifty to sixty percent of newly diagnosed subjects cannot be cured and experience recurrence or metastasis within 3 years. For patients with recurrent or metastatic disease after first-line treatment failure, the median survival time with chemotherapy is only 6 to 9 months, with a 1-year survival rate of 5% to 33% and a 5-year survival rate of merely 3.6%. Laryngeal cancer and hypopharyngeal cancer hold unique significance among head and neck tumors because they not only threaten patients' lives but can also significantly affect their quality of life, particularly the preservation of laryngeal function. Laryngeal function includes voice production, swallowing, and breathing, and the loss of these functions can lead to a severe decline in quality of life. Traditionally, surgical resection has been the main treatment for these cancers, but total laryngectomy can result in permanent voice loss and significant psychological and social impacts. Therefore, how to effectively control the tumor while preserving laryngeal function has become an important goal of treatment.\n\nPD-L1 is a key negative regulator of self-reactive T cells and plays a role in maintaining peripheral immune tolerance and suppressing autoimmunity in various ways, leading to T cell exhaustion and dysfunction, and allowing tumor cells to evade immune surveillance. PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies restore the function of tumor-specific T cells by blocking the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1, thereby enhancing antitumor immunity and are now used to treat a variety of tumors. The efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors as neoadjuvant therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is not yet clear. However, given the good therapeutic effects of immunotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, induction therapy with PD-1 inhibitors is considered to have promising clinical application prospects.\n\nIn summary, we hypothesize that compared with the traditional TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil) neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen, a PD-1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy regimen may be safer and more effective and easier to apply in clinical practice. At present, there are no reports of studies on the use of PD-1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced, resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, either domestically or internationally. We plan to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant treatment with PD-1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy for resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients in China, to provide a basis for future neoadjuvant treatment regimens.",

Sponsor: UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Summary: The goal of this study is to determine the anti-proliferative effect of tirzepatide on the endometrium of patients with endometrial intra-epithelial neoplasia (EIN) and Grade 1 endometrial cancer (EC), by comparing archival endometrial biopsy samples of patients randomized to tirzepatide versus SOC (no tirzepatide) to their post-intervention hysterectomy specimens.\n\nIt was hypothesized that tirzepatide may help fight tumors in two ways: indirectly, by improving the body's overall metabolic health, and directly, by acting on abnormal cells in the uterus, such as those found in endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) and endometrial cancer (EC). EIN is considered a precursor to EC. Tirzepatide may influence the tumor environment through key biological pathways related to insulin, fat metabolism, and mTOR signaling, all of which are often disrupted in individuals with obesity. Because both EIN and EC are strongly linked to obesity, tirzepatide could offer a promising dual benefit, promoting weight loss while also slowing or stopping tumor growth. The primary goal of this study is to determine whether tirzepatide can reduce cell proliferation in the lesions or tumors of patients with EIN and early- stage (Grade 1) EC.\n\nPatients will either be randomized to receive tirzepatide or no tirzepatide for 4 weeks prior to their hysterectomy surgery. Patients randomized to the tirzepatide arm will be given a glucose monitoring system for continuous monitoring with real-time alarms to alert of hypoglycemia. Patients will complete diaries during treatment to document compliance with medication and record any side effects.\n\nPatients will undergo standard of care surgery 7-10 days after the final dose of tirzepatide in order to minimize the risk of gastroparesis. During surgery (hysterectomy), an endometrial biopsy for uterine biopsy tissue will be collected.\n\nAt the 1-month post-operation visit, patients from both arms will be referred to an institutional weight loss clinic.",

    "search_text": "Clinical trial: Use of Hand Prosthesis With Direct Nerve Stimulation for Treatment of Phantom Limb Pain. Status: COMPLETED. Phase: NA. Conditions: Phantom Limb Pain. Interventions: Operation of sensorized hand prosthesis (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Paolo Maria Rossini. Summary: Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a frequent consequence of amputation, and it is notoriously difficult to treat. Amputation usually follows traumatic injuries or surgery following vascular diseases, diabetes, osteomyelitis or tumours in cases where the loss of the limb is required for the survival of the patient. The loss of a limb or other body parts is usually followed by the sensation that the lost body part is still present and can be felt. These phenomena are called, respectively, phantom awareness and phantom sensation. In 50-80% of amputees neuropathic pain develops in the lost limb also referred to as phantom limb pain (PLP). PLP can be related to a certain position or movement of the phantom limb, and might be elicited or worsened by a range of physical factors (e.g. changes in the weather or pressure on the residual limb) and psychological factors (e.g. emotional stress). It is well known that most treatments available for PLP today, such as pharmacological, surgical, anaesthetic, psychological and other, are ineffective. Today it is believed that phantom limb pain may be related to changes in the cortex of the brain. There is evidence that these changes may be modulated - or even reversed - by providing sensory input to the stump or amputation zone. For example, cortical reorganization and alleviation of phantom limb pain has been observed in amputees following intense use of a hand prosthesis. However, there is no consistent knowledge on which type of peripheral sensory feedback may be effective in affecting the cortical plasticity or on how to best apply the sensory feedback. The aim of the proposed research is to create natural, meaningful sensations through providing sensory feedback (i.e. surface or neural electrical stimulation) and the effectiveness to alleviate phantom limb pain and restore the cortical neuroplastic changes.",

Sponsor: Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. Summary: This clinical trial compares the effect of using weighted blankets versus regular blankets during first time infusions (e.g. chemotherapy, targeted therapy etc.) to decrease adverse side effects such as anxiety and distress in cancer (oncology) patients. Feeling safe, comforted, and grounded in the world are some of the benefits noted by individuals who use weighted blankets. Deep touch pressure (DTP) has been found to reduce symptoms of stress and anxiety and is defined as a sensation one feels when being hugged, squeezed, or held. DTP affects the nervous system by creating a calming effect which may lower stress and increase feelings of well-being. The use of weighted blankets may help to manage anxiety and distress during chemotherapy or immunotherapy infusions.",

    "search_text": "Clinical trial: Real-world Study Evaluating the Long-term Outcomes of Pegylated Interferon \u03b1-2b Treatment in the Families With Clusters of HBV Infection and Unfavorable Prognosis - A Prospective, Controlled, Multicenter, Cohort Study. Status: RECRUITING. Conditions: Hepatitis B, Chronic (CHB); Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). Interventions: Peg IFN-\u03b1-2b (DRUG). Sponsor: First Affiliated Hospital Xi'an Jiaotong University. Summary: Chronic hepatitis B can develop into cirrhosis and liver cancer, which seriously endangers the life and health of people. In China, HBV is mainly transmitted from mother to child, showing the phenomenon of family clusters. Similarly, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma occur in familial clusters. Familial clusters of HBV infection with unfavorable prognoses refers to HBV-infected patients from two consecutive generations of blood relatives, with at least one family member diagnosed with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous family investigations have shown that the risk and harm of HBV-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are significantly higher in families with familial clusters of HBV infection with unfavorable prognoses than in the general population.\n\nCurrently, antiviral drugs used for CHB mainly include nucleoside analogues (NAs) and interferon-alpha (mainly pegylated interferon-alpha, Peg IFN). NAs mainly inhibits viral replication by blocking the reverse transcription process, but it cannot effectively inhibit the expression of viral proteins such as HBsAg, and rarely achieves clinical cure. Multiple clinical studies have shown that the use of NAs reduces the incidence of cirrhosis decompensation, HCC, and death in patients with CHB compared to untreated or placebo-treated patients. Despite long-term treatment with first-line NAs drugs, CHB patients continue to be at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Peg IFN \u03b1-2b injection is the first-line drug of choice for antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and its main mechanism of action includes anti-HBV, anti-fibrosis, anti-tumor and regulation of immune response. In 2024, a randomized controlled multicenter study showed that Peg IFN \u03b1-2b combined with NAs therapy could effectively prevent hepatocellular carcinoma in CHB patients. There is sufficient evidence in clinical practice that long-term antiviral therapy, whether NAs or Peg IFN \u03b1-2b, reduces the risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death in patients with CHB. In conclusion, early antiviral therapy can reduce the risk of developing hepatitis B cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in CHB patients with familial clusters of HBV infection with unfavorable prognoses.\n\nThe goal of this observational study is to explore the evaluation of pegylated interferon \u03b1-2b combined with first-line NAs on the long-term outcome of CHB antiviral therapy with cirrhosis and HCC progression as the main observation targets, compared with only use of NAs in the context of familial clusters of HBV infection with unfavorable prognoses. It is intended to provide high-quality evidence-based medical evidence for the treatment and follow-up of CHB, explore optimal clinical decision-making, and provide global clinical data for the improvement and evaluation of this difficult-to-treat population. The main question it aims to answer is: Can Peg IFN-\u03b1-2B combined with NAs therapy improve the long-term outcomes of this particular population of familial clusters of HBV infection with unfavorable prognoses compared to first-line NAs monotherapy? Patients with familial clusters of HBV infection with unfavorable prognoses using Peg IFN-\u03b1-2B combined with NAs therapy and NAs monotherapy will be collected laboratory and medical examination data at specified follow-up points, and recorded adverse events and drug combinations in detail for 7 years.",

Summary: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor primarily originating in the nasopharynx, commonly found in populations in southern China, certain regions of Asia, and North Africa. The main treatment for NPC is primarily radiotherapy, with some patients receiving combined chemotherapy. Early-stage NPC patients can achieve adequate tumor control with radiation therapy alone. Various studies report that the 5-year survival rate for very early-stage NPC exceeds 90%. However, some stage I patients experience local recurrence or distant metastasis after treatment, indicating treatment failure. This study aims to retrospectively analyze the factors contributing to treatment failure and prognostic factors in this group of early-stage NPC patients.",

Conditions: Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. Interventions: Gefitinib (DRUG); Docetaxel (DRUG). Sponsor: Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Summary: Gefitinib, the first EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in the world was examined as monotherapy in two phase \u2161 studies called IDEAL trials. Response rate with doses of 250mg and 500mg/day were similar, ranging from 10% to 18%. Posterior analysis demonstrated that patients with EGFR mutation had an improved response rate (RR) to gefitinib compared to wild-type patients (46% versus 10%). The early trials that evaluated EGFR-TKIs for the second- and third-line settings of advanced NSCLC did not select patients on the basis of any EGFR marker. The IEESSA Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer (ISEL) trial evaluated the role of second-line gefitinib 250mg/day in 1692 patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients with EGFR mutations had higher RR than patients without (37.5% versus 2.6%). From the above results, the response rate in patients without EGFR gene mutation was obviously different (10% versus 2.6%). The methods used for detecting EGFR gene mutation was different, which might contribute to the difference of response rates. In IDEAL trial, EGFR gene mutation was detected by sequencing. But in ISEL trial, EGFR gene mutation was detected by ARMS. As we know, ARMS was more sensitive than sequencing in detecting EGFR gene mutation. That is to say, in IDEAL trials some EGFR mutant patients were misdiagnosed as wild-type patients, so the response rate was higher. Recently, Wu Yi-Long et al reported that relative abundance of EGFR mutations predicted benefit form gefitinib treatment for advanced non small cell lung cancer. The study cohort was all Chinese. In this study, the objective response rate in patients without EGFR mutation detected by ARMS was 16.1%, which was significantly higher than the response rate of docetaxel. But in 2012 American society of clinical oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, the Tailor study in which Italian NSCLC patients were enrolled demonstrated a clear superiority of docetaxel over erlotinib as second line treatment for patients without EGFR mutations in exons 19 or 21. So we wonder if the racial difference is the determinant factor. So the purpose of this trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of gefitinib with docetaxel as second-line therapy for advanced or metastatic Chinese NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR.",

Summary: In liver surgery peroperative assessment och the future liver remnant (FLR) is pivotal in order to avoid posthepatectomy liver failure. To date this is mainly performed by measuring the volume of the FLR. Of course FLR volume acts as a surrogate measure of FLR function and the correlation between volume and function is not always accurate. Several techniques to assess FLR function has been proposed. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) and Dynamic MRI are the two such methods. In this study we compare HBS and MRI, in addition to contrast-enhanced CT and ICG, repeatedly performed before and after right hepatectomy in patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

Sponsor: SingHealth Polyclinics. Summary: An Innovation involving Self-Surveillance and Serious Gaming to Increase Smoking Quit rate: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\n\nAbstract Introduction and study aims Smoking is a health hazard associated with cancer, vascular and lung diseases. Current methods to manage smoking cessation have limited success. A recent systematic review suggests increase in smoking cessation potential via serious gaming to attain desirable healthcare outcomes. Outcomes are limited in these studies to demonstrate, quantify, and understand these interventions.\n\nThe investigators have demonstrated feasibility of a portable device (\"STEADES-1\") which allows smokers to measure their exhaled-breath carbon monoxide (eCO) levels, related to their cigarette-smoking intensities. They can relay the eCO measurements via smart-phone applications (app) to their virtual coach to report their smoking cessation progress. The investigators have created an enhanced STEADES-2 system, which incorporates gamification using the eCO data as game element and allows anonymized smokers to compete with each other for the game rewards. It has additional authentication functions and embeds an e-coaching program by trained healthcare professionals.\n\nMethods and analysis This pilot randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of the STEADES-2 system in increasing smoking quit rate. The former includes assessing the smokers to monitor their eCO levels; leverage on telesupport via the e-Coaching to raise their motivation; reduce relapse tendencies by playing serious games with fellow smokers. The investigators postulate that the smoking quit rate in smokers in the STEADES-2 intervention group will be higher by 50% than the controls over 12 weeks. This trial will randomly select 20 smokers each into the intervention group and the control group. Smokers in both groups will be compared in terms of complete abstinence from cigarettes as the primary outcome at 12 weeks post-enrolment.\n\nEthics and dissemination The Institutional Review Board approves the study. The results will be disseminated via conferences and publications.",

Sponsor: Ezra AI, Inc.. Summary: The Ezra Faster Scan study uses non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology that can \"visually\" detect early and late-stage cancer, and other pathologies. MRIs use a magnetic field and radio waves to create a 3-dimensional (3D) image of an individual's body without using ionizing radiation.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to decrease the amount of time required by an individual to complete an early cancer screening comprehensive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, such as the Ezra Full Body MRI imaging scan. If the time required to conduct a comprehensive scan is reduced, the cost of the scan may also decrease. By decreasing consumer costs and time, more individuals may be able to afford MRI-based early cancer screening technology.\n\nParticipants in this study will undergo a minimum 30-minute MRI session. These sessions will be used to evaluate new MRI \"instructions\" that allow for a faster MRI scan time. The images will also be used to develop mathematical models or machine learning tools that allow images to be enhanced. By enhancing images using machine learning, they may be restored to a quality typically observed in MRI sessions with longer scan (acquisition) times.\n\nTo read more about the study, potential participants may review the informed consent form located below in the References section.

Summary: DM-CHOC-PEN is a polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryl carbonate that has demonstrated antineoplastic activities in patients with advanced cancers - melanoma, lung, breast and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) involving the CNS during a Phase I study. These findings support the preclinical responses seen in mice bearing intracerebrally implanted human breast and GBM tumor xenografts. Toxicity was acceptable - hyperbilirubinemia (in patients with liver disease and/or liver metastasis). No hematological, renal, cardiovascular, behavioral or cognitive impairment/neurotoxicities were noted during the Phase I human trial or in previous pre-clinical studies.\n\nThe drug is available for use as a soy bean oil/egg yolk lecithin/glycerin water emulsion; the latter continues to be chemically and biologically stable and safe.\n\nPatients with advanced lung, breast and melanoma cancers spread to the CNS and primary CNS malignancies will be eligible for enrollment and treatment, providing the required blood and other eligibility requirements are met. The trial will be 2-tiered - patients with liver involvement vs. non-liver involvement will be treated with different doses of the drug.\n\nThe trial is open and patients are currently being enrolled and treated with the protocol.",

Conditions: Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, Childhood; PTEN Loss; NOTCH1 Gene Mutation; Pediatric Cancer. Sponsor: Sun Yat-sen University. Summary: With the development of molecular biology and precise medical treatment, new challenges have been raised in the diagnosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in children. In recent years, the criteria for clinical staging and efficacy evaluation of NHL in children have been updated. Recent clinical studies of COG in the United States and LMB in France have confirmed that molecular biological markers such as Notch1, PTEN and LOH6q are significantly associated with the prognosis of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). These molecular biological markers should be included in the new risk stratification system. High-intensity treatment of high-risk patients will improve survival. Recent studies have also suggested that PET/CT is helpful in evaluating residual lesions in patients with lymphoma after chemotherapy. In order to keep pace with the times in the diagnosis, clinical staging, risk stratification, efficacy evaluation and treatment of NHL in children. SCCCG-LBL-2017 was formulated by South China Children's Cancer Group of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which mainly updated in clinical staging, efficacy evaluation, risk stratification, treatment,etc..",

Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as iodine I 131 tositumomab, can find cancer cells and deliver radioactive cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Combining a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody with combination chemotherapy before autologous stem cell transplant may kill more cancer cells",

Summary: Objective :\n\nTo study and support the hospitalization and the return home of patients with the help of a psychological follow-up started in a hospital institution and which will continue in the patient's home, based on the concepts of transitionality and narrativity.\n\nMaterial and method To do this, the subjects will benefit from psychological interviews where they will freely discuss what concerns them, whether it is illness, treatment, returning home, or any other personal subject.\n\nThey will be divided into two groups of 5 patients each, one of the groups will benefit from follow-up in an institution as contracted for several years between the Institute of Hematology and the psychologists of the UMDSP, another from the same follow-up but with the presence of the psychologist at the time of discharge extended to the patient's home after leaving the hospital for a period of 2 months.\n\nTo ensure a certain consistency in the evaluation criteria, these will be standardized in the form of questionnaires completed blindly by the patient, a caregiver and the investigator, at 3 key times of the research (entry, discharge from hospital, two months after this discharge)\n\nDevice tested:\n\nThe aim of this work is to test the benefits of a device based on transitionality, which can limit, thanks to the restoration of the symbolization process, the deleterious effects of each of the stages imposed by the disease, the care and the resumption of autonomy once the active phase of care has passed.\n\nNarrativity is also at the heart of this transitional device. It makes it possible to evoke the present experience of the patient in connection with future projects and in the continuity of past, potentially traumatic events. It opens onto a dynamic temporal perspective where the trauma freezes.\n\nThe whole process promotes the subjective reappropriation of the experience and a psychic well-being.",

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING. Phase: PHASE1. Conditions: Solid Tumors. Interventions: BI 3923948 (DRUG); Ezabenlimab (DRUG). Sponsor: Boehringer Ingelheim. Summary: This study is open to adults aged 18 and over or above legal age with different types of recurrent advanced cancer (solid tumors) that have spread to other parts of the body and that are accessible for injection and biopsy. This is a study for people for whom previous treatment was not successful or no treatment exists, with a life expectancy of at least 3 months after starting study treatment. The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of a medicine called BI 3923948, that people with advanced cancer can tolerate, when taken alone and together with a type of antibody called a checkpoint inhibitor (anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody). Another purpose is to check whether the study treatment can fight cancer. In this study, BI 3923948 is given to people for the first time.\n\nThis study has 2 arms. In Arm A, participants get BI 3923948 alone for up to 3 months. In Arm B, participants get BI 3923948 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. Participants who take the combination treatment get BI 3923948 for up to 3 months and a checkpoint inhibitor for up to 1 year. BI 3923948 is given as injection(s) into the tumor, and the checkpoint inhibitor is given as an infusion into a vein. Participants get the medicines about every 3 weeks. This is called a treatment cycle. Only in treatment cycle 1 will participants get BI 3923948 twice in the first week.\n\nParticipants visit the site study site regularly. The number of study visits vary based on the study arm and treatment response. Some visits include an overnight stay. The doctors regularly check the participants' health and monitor the tumors. The doctors closely check the health of the participants and also take note of any health problems that could have been caused by the study treatment.",

Conditions: Head and Neck Cancer. Interventions: High flow oxygen therapy (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. Summary: Patients undergoing major head and neck surgery often develop breathing difficulties as a result of build up of sputum and difficulty taking deep breaths. Often as part of the surgery patients may also require a tracheotomy tube (a temporary tube placed into their airway) which is removed around 5-7 days after the operation. The presence of this tracheostomy tube increases the patient's risk of developing breathing problems, especially difficulty clearing sputum and reduced lung volumes. To reduce the risk of developing these problems, different forms of oxygen therapy and humidification are used. This normally involves using oxygen masks, nebulisers and other medications to help loosen the sputum and maintain blood oxygen levels. Another method of giving oxygen and humidification is through the use of AIRVO, which delivers the air / oxygen to the patient at higher rates as well as warming and humidifying the air.\n\nThe aim of this study is to compare the AIRVO system to standard care in a small sample of patients (20 patients) undergoing major head and neck surgery involving insertion of a tracheostomy tube.\n\nThe study will compare rates of breathing complications (e.g. pneumonia, reduced lung volume) as well as comparing the time to remove the tracheostomy tube and the time the patient is required to stay in hospital. These results will then be used to develop a larger funded study.",

Conditions: Obesity. Interventions: Abdominal waist and hip circumference (OTHER). Sponsor: Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc- Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain. Summary: Despite advances in surgical technique, preoperative patient evaluation and post-operative care, elective colorectal surgery carries a risk of mortality of approximately 2% and a morbidity rate ranging from 20-40%. Risk prediction is important for two reasons: it informs decision-making in individual cases before surgery (part of informed consent) and allows the comparison of actual outcome with predicted outcome. A number of scoring systems for assessing risk of death after surgery have been developed. They vary from simple scores based on a few variables to highly complex mathematical models requiring detailed data input. Recently, the Association Fran\u00e7aise de Chirurgie conducted a multicentre study to develop and validate a 4-item predictive score of mortality after colorectal resection which has good predictive value and is simple to use.\n\nAlthough many surgeons associate obesity with adverse outcomes, recent large, well-designed studies have been unable to show that obesity (defined as Body Mass Index (BMI) \\>30) is an independent risk factor for major morbidity or mortality after general abdominal surgery. Recently abdominal obesity (waist measurement \\>102cm in men and \\>88cm in women) has been shown to have better correlation with cardiovascular disease than BMI and is strongly associated with a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes (insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and abdominal obesity) known as the metabolic syndrome. Waist circumference and waist/hip ratio are measures of abdominal obesity that correlate with the amount of intra-abdominal rather than subcutaneous or general body fat and may be a better measure of the risk of intra-operative complications and post-operative morbidity following abdominal surgery than BMI.\n\nThe study will be prospective and multicentred, with 28 participating units in Belgium, France, Switzerland and Sweden. The coordinating centre will be UCL St Luc. The study will start on 1st September 2008 and will aim to include a minimum of 1000 patients. Consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal resectional surgery for cancer or diverticulitis will be included. In addition to normal preoperative assessment, waist and hip circumference will be measured before surgery and specific data will be collected on intra and post-operative complications and mortality. Data will be recorded using an encrypted, anonymous database using variables carefully selected to assess short and long term outcomes. The study will be the first of its kind to investigate abdominal obesity as a predictive risk factor for colorectal surgery and will also be one of the biggest prospective studies of morbidity after colorectal surgery.\n\nThe aims of the study are a) to assess if waist measurement or waist/hip ratio is a better predictive risk factor for complications or mortality after colorectal surgery than BMI, and b) if this measurement adds accuracy to the AFC score in risk prediction.",

Interventions: 90-Yttrium-labelled anti-CD66 monoclonal antibody (DRUG). Sponsor: Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust. Summary: Children affected by high risk or relapsed/refractory leukaemia have a poor prognosis, with an increased risk of relapse. These patients generally need treatment intensification and a bone marrow transplantation (BMT).\n\nNevertheless, with conventional treatent the risk of relapse after transplant remains high.\n\nRadioimmunotherapy provides a way to deliver high dose irradiation to the bone marrow (where leukaemia resides), while sparing normal organs and tissues from its toxicity.This can be achieved by linking a radioactive molecule (Yttrium90) to an antibody that, once infused in the blood, targets marrow/leukemic cells.",

Summary: The intent of the study is to show the potential benefits of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity.\n\nThis is a prospective, randomized, blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial that will enroll patients who are to be treated with anthracycline chemotherapy (doxorubicin, epirubicin, idrarubicin, or mitoxantone) to either lisinopril or placebo group. The study will be performed at the Genesys Hurley Cancer Institute. The treating oncologist who intends to start the patient on anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent will provide the patient with a recruitment flyer and informed consent form and then referred to the research nurse. Subjects interested in participation, that do not meet any of the exclusion criteria, will be consented and enrolled by the research nurse prior to their first treatment with chemotherapy. Over a period of 1 to 3 weeks the study medication will be titrated in a stepwise fashion to a target of 20 mg daily, maintaining a systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg. A baseline echocardiogram with strain and strain rate imaging will be obtained prior to initiation of anthracycline chemotherapy. Subsequent echocardiograms with strain and strain rate imaging will be performed every 3 months for a total of 12 months.\n\nPatients will be followed for a total of 12 months, starting on the day of enrollment. We intend to recruit a total of 200 patients.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study is a change in change in strain and strain rate parameters prior to, during, and after anthracycline chemotherapy compared to placebo.\n\nStudy data will be collected and managed using the Ascension installation of REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is a secure, web application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing user-friendly web-based case report forms, real-time data entry validation (e.g. for data types and range checks), audit trails and a de-identified data export mechanism to common statistical packages.\n\nEchocardiographic data will be stored in cine-loop format on a private, password protected echocardiogram viewing software and analyzed by a separate blinded cardiologist.\n\nPatients will be evaluated according to the standard oncologic evaluation. The treating oncologist will make decisions on their treatment based on their personal standards and clinical judgement.",

Interventions: Physical activity training (OTHER). Sponsor: Assistance Publique Hopitaux De Marseille. Summary: Adapted physical activity (APA) in the context of cancer is a field of growing interest and has been explored in numerous publications. In adults, the effects of APA on survival, symptoms and quality of life are established and its physiological consequences on immunity, angiogenesis and hormone secretion are under investigation.\n\nIn children and adolescents, evidence is scarce: pilot studies show clinical benefit of physical activity practiced in a wide variety of situations and protocols with low level of scientific evidence. It is therefore not possible to recommend this practice in pediatrics despite the large number of initiatives and the conviction of many clinicians that there is a benefit for patients. In particular, there are few trials in children with advanced cancer pathologies or in palliative care. However, these patients have a high prevalence of severe symptoms (pain, digestive disorders, asthenia, and anxiety) for which physical activity may represent a therapeutic option.\n\nThe purpose of our study is to describe a protocol of adapted physical activity and to evaluate its feasibility and toxicity according to a well-known and validated methodology in oncology used in drug development.\n\nMethodology is based on a simple and reproducible intervention combining brisk walking on treadmill and exercises of muscular strengthening with varying durations and intensities depending on physical capabilities of patients.\n\nThe primary objective is to define the volume of physical activity that can be proposed to a patient starting APA based on the assessment of his physical condition evaluated by a 6-minutes walking distance test.\n\nInclusion criteria are broad to allow study population to represent the diversity of patients in pediatric palliative oncology. Stratification of patients in three groups based on a 6-minutes walking distance test aims to adapt intervention to physical capability of patients and improve tolerance.\n\nDose escalation will be set with a \"3 + 3\" regimen used in drug early phases trials.\n\nPrimary outcome measure is perceived tolerance evaluated by the patient with a subjective scoring on CREST scale. Any score greater than 8/10 defines intolerance.",

Summary: Cancer and cancer treatment often lead patients and survivors to experience a host of chronic symptoms, of which sleep disturbances are a major concern. Smartphone-based meditation via an already-developed app (i.e., Calm) is a unique and novel way of providing a potentially helpful symptom-management strategy to cancer patients and survivors. Our hypothesis is that cancer patients/survivors using the Calm smartphone app for eight weeks will see improved sleep disturbance (primary outcome) as well as anxiety, depression, pain intensity, global health, quality of life, emotional regulation, and mindfulness when compared to a time and attention-matched health education podcast control group. Cancer patients/survivors (n=300) will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group for eight weeks, with study outcome measurement occurring at baseline, post-intervention (i.e., week eight), and follow-up (i.e., week 20).",

Interventions: Partial breast radiation after lumpectomy (RADIATION). Sponsor: Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Summary: In 2008 a research study conducted by Dr. Barth involving 46 women determined that whole breast radiation therapy performed after a lumpectomy of borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors decreases rate of recurrence. None of the 46 participants developed a local recurrence.\n\nBased on information we have learned from research studies, we recommend whole breast radiation therapy for women with malignant and borderline phyllodes tumors after they receive a lumpectomy.\n\nNew methods for delivering breast radiotherapy are being developed that allow radiation to be delivered solely to the site of the surgical resection. This is called partial breast radiation. The main advantage of partial breast radiation is that it simplifies treatment for the patient. Radiation is delivered twice a day for 5 days, rather than 5 days per week for 6 weeks. The main concern is that partial breast radiation might miss other sites of breast cancer in the breast receiving the radiation.\n\nEvidence is accumulating from research studies that partial breast radiation therapy after surgical removal of the more common type of breast cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma, the breast results in rates of local recurrence that are comparable to those seen after whole breast radiation therapy.\n\nIn contrast to patients with invasive ductal cancers of the breast, it is very rare for patients to have phyllodes tumors that appear in more than one area of the breast. Review of research data determined that cancer recurrences seen in patients with phyllodes tumors that had undergone lumpectomies were almost always at the original tumor site. Therefore, partial breast radiation is likely to be as effective as whole breast radiation therapy after resection of malignant phyllodes tumors.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to determine what the chances are that a phyllodes tumor will recur in the breast when the breast is treated with partial breast radiation therapy after a lumpectomy.",

Conditions: Hot Flashes. Interventions: fezolinetant (DRUG); placebo (DRUG). Sponsor: Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.. Summary: This study was for women in menopause with moderate to severe hot flashes. Menopause, a normal part of aging, is the time of a woman's last period. Hot flashes can interrupt a woman's daily life. The study treatments were fezolinetant 30 milligrams (mg) (1 tablet of fezolinetant and 1 placebo tablet) once a day, fezolinetant 45 mg (2 tablets of fezolinetant) once a day or placebo (2 tablets) once a day. (Placebo was a dummy treatment that looks like medicine but did not had any medicine in it.) The study compared fezolinetant and placebo after 4 and 12 weeks of dosing. The study evaluated if fezolinetant reduces the number of hot flashes. And the study evaluated if fezolinetant reduces the severity of the hot flashes. Women in the study received an electronic handheld device at the first study visit. (It was similar to a smart phone.) Each day of the study, study participants used this to record their hot flashes. Their record for the 10 days before the start of study treatment was checked. They remained in the study if their record shown 7 or 8 moderate to severe hot flashes per day (50 or more per week). Next, they were picked for 1 of the 2 study treatments (fezolinetant or placebo) by chance alone. It was like flipping a coin. The study participants took study treatment for 52 weeks. The first 12 weeks of study treatment are \"double-blinded.\" That means that the study participants and the study doctors did not knew who took which of the study treatments (fezolinetant 30 mg, fezolinetant 45 mg or placebo) during that time. The last 40 weeks of study treatment are \"noncontrolled.\" That means that each study participant and the study doctors knew which study treatment that study participant took during that time. Women who took fezolinetant during the first 12 weeks continued to take the same dose. Women who took placebo during the first 12 weeks took fezolinetant. Their dose was either 30 mg or 45 mg fezolinetant. At weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16 and then once a month, the study participants visited the hospital or clinic for a check-up. They were asked about medications, side effects and how they felt. Other checks included physical exam and vital signs (heart rate, temperature and blood pressure). Blood and urine was collected for laboratory tests. Study participants completed questionnaires that were about how hot flashes affect their daily life. Study participants who still had their uterus had the following 2 tests done at the first and last study visits. One of the 2 tests was endometrial biopsy. This test involves removing a small amount of tissue from the inside lining of the uterus. The tissue was then checked under a microscope. The other test is transvaginal ultrasound. This test used sound waves to create pictures of the organs in the pelvis. The sound waves were transmitted by a probe (transducer), which was placed inside the vagina. Study participants may have a screening mammogram done at the first and/or last study visit. A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breasts used to screen for breast cancer. Study participants who did not had this test done in the last 12 months had it done at the first study visit. They had it done at the last study visit if they are due for their screening mammogram and their own doctor agrees. The last check-up at the hospital or clinic was 3 weeks after the last dose of study treatment.",

Conditions: Breast Cancer. Interventions: MagSeed and MagTrace in breast cancer pati\u00ebnts (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Zuyderland Medisch Centrum. Summary: Rationale:\n\nIn breast cancer, a sentinel node procedure is performed to investigate whether malignant cells have spread to the axillary lymph nodes. This is an important part of determining the stage of breast cancer and the final treatment plan.\n\nA disadvantage of the sentinel node procedure is that it is performed using radioactive tracing with concomitant radiation exposure for the patients and involved health care personnel. In addition, the use of radioactive tracing puts high demands on the logistics in the operation theatre: the capacity of patients that can be treated in one day is limited and the radio-active tracing leads to many time-consuming precautionary measures.\n\nA radiation free alternative would therefore have multiple advantages. Not only with respect to radiation exposure for the patients and health care workers, but also by reducing the waiting time for operation for the patients as it will make the planning of patients for surgery more efficient.\n\nRecently, a radiation free tracer for the sentinel node procedure has become available (Magtrace). This tracer has been tested in small-case studies and is currently used as standard care in several hospitals around the world.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Magtrace in the sentinel node procedure in breast cancer in the Breast Care Centre in Zuyderland Medical Centre; with the ultimate goal to make the sentinel node procedure a radiation free process.\n\nStudy design:\n\nA prospective cohort of forty patients with breast cancer and an indication for a sentinel node procedure will be injected with both Technetium (radioisotope) and Magtrace (magnetic). All patients in this study will receive both tracers.\n\nStudy population:\n\nPatients of 18 years or older with breast cancer and an indication for a sentinel node procedure will be included. These patients will be recruited by their breast surgeon in the outpatient department of the Breast Care Centre in Zuyderland Medical Centre.\n\nIntervention (if applicable):\n\nSentinel node procedure using a magnetic tracer next to Technetium.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints:\n\nThe concordance in detection of sentinel nodes by Magtrace and the Technetium tracer, measured by the sensitivity and specificity of Magtrace in detecting sentinel nodes with Technetium tracer as gold standard.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:\n\nThe goal of this project is evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of Magtrace in the sentinel node procedure. To establish that Magtrace is a non-inferior and a non-radioactive alternative for Technetium with respect to reliability in detecting metastases. The ultimate goal is to make the sentinel node procedure a radiation free process.",

Conditions: Overweight and Obese Adults; Healthy. Interventions: Phase 1 - Maintenance Diet (OTHER); Phase 2 - Weight loss diet (OTHER). Sponsor: University of Aberdeen. Summary: Obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, primarily due to elevated abdominal fat storage. With nearly two-thirds of the UK population living with overweight or obesity, there is an urgent necessity for evidence-based public health guidance to promote healthy weight. Calorie deficit can facilitate weight loss and body fat reduction, leading to health benefits, such as improved blood glucose control. Current weight management advice centres on lifestyle modification, incorporating changes to diet and physical activity to support a calorie deficit. However, existing dieting recommendations fail to consider gender or age. This is a surprising oversight, as it is well established that health outcomes vary significantly between men and women across the lifespan. Further, the menopause may have an impact on fat storage linked to changes in sex hormones. Our recent research, involving both mice and humans, has indicated that females are less responsive to weight loss and fat reduction during dieting. This study aims to understand endocrine and metabolic sex-based differences in obesity and calorie restriction, with a particular focus on women's health. We plan to conduct a diet study with 75 participants, encompassing both younger and older men and women, to monitor changes in energy expenditure and body composition using gold-standard techniques, such as doubly-labelled water. Blood and abdominal fat tissue samples will be collected to investigate how sex hormones might elucidate these differences. The aim of the study is to enhance our understanding of diet and women's health to combat obesity and promote healthy ageing.",

Phase: PHASE1, PHASE2. Conditions: Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung. Interventions: chemotherapy (DRUG); Radiation (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Clinical Oncology Research Associates. Summary: The study is designed for subjects whose cancer is too advanced and therefore cannot be operated with the goal of completely removing the cancer. At this stage of the disease, most subjects cannot be cured from the disease, however, treatment can help subjects to live longer and better by keeping the cancer under control. All treatment offered to is primarily pursuing that goal. Subjects at this stage of their disease traditionally receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy, both treatments in succession or both concurrently. Recently, the administration of both methods of treatment concurrently has been employed and indicate somewhat better results. Specifically, a class of chemotherapy agents called Vinca Alakaloids used in combination with radiation therapy appear promising as determined in small studies. The drug Navelbine is part of this class of drugs. This drug is approved as an infusion through the veins. The pill form is under development and will be used in this form in this treatment program.\n\nFor this protocol, radiation will be administered using a schedule which is more convenient for patients, by once weekly chest irradiation for a total of 12 weeks. Use of this schedule was determined to be as good as the more commonly used daily radiotherapy. The once weekly schedule is less cumbersome as it involves less visits. The rationale and reason why you are being asked to participate in this program is to study whether the drug Navelbine can be given together with the once weekly radiation schedule. Radiation will be administered in two fractions, 6 hours apart on one day. For this program, the drug Navelbine would be made available as a pill, and would not have to be infused through the vein. The proposed protocol will use increasing doses of the drug Navelbine in pill form to find the highest dose of Navelbine that is tolerated in conjunction with radiation therapy. Initially, each subject will receive one dose of Navelbine, which is higher than the dose of the previous subject. This escalation will continue until the highest tolerated dose has been determined.\n\nThe administration via pill would be easier and avoid previously experienced side effects that were experienced by infusion into the veins of subjects, such as burning and sores at the infusion site.",

Despite its activity, hormone therapy is associated with initial, or more frequently acquired, resistance after exposure to one or more treatment lines.\n\nThe combination of palbociclib with hormone therapy significantly increases progression free survival (PFS) compared with hormone therapy in first and second treatment line of HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer.\n\nThese results lead to palbociclib approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2015, and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval in November 2016 for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic HR+/HER2-breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, and for patients who had previously received hormone therapy in combination with fulvestrant.\n\nIn Spain, palbociclib was launched last November 1st, 2017. During this period, approximately 3500 patients have received treatment with Palbociclib, and approximately a half of them in first-line treatment in combination with hormone therapy. The collection of efficacy and toxicity data in the first-line usage in the clinical practice setting is of clinical interest.",

Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Summary: This study is a prospective and effective research study. The aim is to assess the difference in the quality of life of the family members of patients with colorectal cancer after application of follow-up disease management using mobile network terminals and routine clinical treatment follow-up management. The hypothesis is that the application of mobile-based disease management system significantly improves the quality of life of the patients' family members, thereby improving the quality of life of the patients' families.\n\nApproximately 100 families of colorectal cancer patients who had been diagnosed as high-risk stage II or stage III and required adjuvant chemotherapy XELOX regimen within 6 months after initial diagnosis were randomly assigned to the control and study groups at a 1: 1 ratio, with approximately 50 cases in the control group and about 50 patients in the study group. The reason for choosing these tumors is because the patients with these tumors will present a series of clinical symptoms during the treatment, which requires family members to take care of them. All patient and their family demographics, questionnaires on quality of life of patient's family, adverse events and other information will be collected.\n\nThe study uses a network-centric randomization system. In the randomization process, stratified randomization will be carried out according to the education level of the patient's family members (junior college degree or above vs. below college degree). The family members of the patients participating in the study will be randomly assigned to the tumor patient management platform or clinical routine treatment follow-up group.\n\nFamily members of all patients will be followed up to 2 months after randomization, or withdrew from the study (with the preceding events as the end point). Unless the patient's family member withdraws from the study, lost to follow-up, or the study is terminated, the patient is considered to be in the study. Family members of patients who are randomly assigned to the full management platform need to participate in a 60 minutes concentrated training session for 27 days, taught by experts online. The content of the lectures includes medical treatment guidelines, pain relief, family rehabilitation, family communication, family roles, early screening prevention, Medical insurance and other aspects. The contents of the online courses are: 1) Doctors are also mortal; 2) New medicines and new therapies; 3) Alternative therapies; 4) Don't panic during the operation; 5) Pain relief; 6) Side effects of treatment; 8) About the truth; 9) New topics; 10) Anti-cancer cost-effectiveness; 11) Medical insurance; 12) Commercial medical insurance; 13) Exercise and rehabilitation; 14) Nutrition and Foods to increase leukocytes level ; 15) Long-term persistence; 16) Acceptance Change; 17) Two new roles; 18) Future expectation.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This helps stop the spread of tumor cells. Giving nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib could prevent cancer from returning.",

Sponsor: Groupe fran\u00e7ais d'\u00e9tude des Maladies Inflammatoires de loeil. Summary: This is a french multicenter observational study assessing safety and efficacy of biosimilar of Tocilizumab in Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) with active aortitis, including 14 reference centers from the Groupe d'Etude Fran\u00e7ais des vascularites des gros vaisseaux (GEFA).\n\nGiant Cell Arteritis (GCA), formerly known as temporal arteritis, is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in patients aged \u2265 50 years. GCA is defined by granulomatous arteritis that affects large#sized and medium#sized blood vessels with a predisposition to affect the cranial arteries. Aortitis accounted for more than 50% of GCA patients with the new imaging techniques. Aortitis is typically diagnosed using imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Aortitis is an inflammation of the aorta, leading to a range of symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue, and chest pain. In severe cases, aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection can occur, which can be life-threatening.\n\nMultiple reports have demonstrated the presence of abnormal pro-inflammatory cytokine production in large-vessel vasculitis patients, particularly those with GCA, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interferon-\u03b3, by T lymphocytes and macrophages. IL-6 has been implicated as a crucial cytokine in the pathogenesis of aortitis and targeting its signaling has shown promising results in treating the condition. IL-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab have been found to effectively reduce disease activity and improve clinical outcomes in GCA patients.\n\nThe GIACTA study (GiAnt cell arteritis roActemra (tocilizumab) study) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of GCA. The study included 251 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA and found that treatment with tocilizumab significantly increased the proportion of patients who achieved sustained remission from GCA at 52 weeks, compared to placebo. Additionally, tocilizumab was associated with a lower incidence of disease flares and a reduced need for glucocorticoid therapy.\n\nFollowing the positive results of the GIACTA study, tocilizumab was approved for the treatment of GCA in adults with active disease, including aortitis, who have not responded to glucocorticoids, or for whom glucocorticoid therapy is not appropriate, by regulatory agencies around the world, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.\n\nHowever, the efficacy of IL-6 inhibitors on aorta inflammation as assessed by modern and powerful imaging techniques has never been specifically studied in GCA.\n\nThis observational study will provide important informations on the impact of Tyenne\u00ae (tocilizumab) associated with short term low dose steroids on clinical manifestations and vessel inflammation and damage in aortitis of GCA.",

Summary: In this study, we aim to reduce the burden of malnutrition in cancer patients by implementing and evaluating an improved nutritional support, using digital communication and registration tools during the clinical pathway. The project targets a group of patients with a high frequency of malnutrition, due to cancer and the subsequent therapy, where knowledge on the efficient and cost-effective treatment is scarce. The effect of the improved nutrition support will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial, and the primary endpoint is the prevalence of malnutrition. The long-term goal is to benefit the patients by increasing the completion rate of cancer treatment, reducing the infection rate, need for antibiotics, the total length of hospital stays and number of non-elective re-admissions, and thus increasing the patients' quality of life and survival. The project will be patient-orientated and result in a sustainable approach for the management of malnutrition.",

Summary: This is a single arm phase II study. All patients will receive 3 cycles of the treatment of nab-paclitaxel (Days 1, 8 and 15), gemcitabine (Days 1, 8 and 15), and TTFields (worn every day for at least 18 hours). Following the initial 3 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel/TTFields treatment, patients will undergo restaging by CT or MRI. Patients with stable disease or better will undergo surgery for resection within 8 weeks following completion of initial chemotherapy although enrolling sites are encouraged to perform resection within 4 weeks of Cycle 3 D15 of therapy. If resection yields R0 or R1, patients will begin an additional 3 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel/TTFields treatment within 8 weeks of surgery. Based on available literature, it is expected that a percentage of patients will not undergo resection either due to disease progression or due to toxicities/ complications of the neoadjuvant segment of therapy. These patients will be included in the evaluable patients for both co-primary endpoints as well as the secondary endpoints including ORR, adverse events, and OS.",

Interventions: Neuropsychological test battery (OTHER). Sponsor: Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Summary: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women with the majority receiving an endocrine therapy (ET) in the adjuvant setting. ETs dramatically reduce recurrence and improve survival but given the aging population and increased survivorship, there are growing concerns regarding the cognitive effects of ETs since estrogen is neuroprotective. A critical unanswered question is whether there are differences in cognitive decline between the two classes of ETs, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs - tamoxifen) and aromatase inhibitors (letrozole and anastrozole), in older women at greater risk of hormone receptor breast cancer and cognitive decline. Before a large multicentre observational study can be undertaken the investigators are proposing a feasibility study to establish metrics on participation, retention and adherence rates and parameter estimates to inform sample size calculation required to detect cognitive differences between the two ET classes. A convenience sample of chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients, aged 65 and older, with early stage disease, 25 on a SERM and 50 on an aromatase inhibitor, will be assessed cognitively at baseline and after one year.",

Summary: The recent global IMbrave150 study evaluated the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab versus sorafenib in 501 patients with advanced or metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The median overall survival (OS) was notably better in the atezolizumab/bevacizumab group. However, for HCC patients with intrahepatic macrovascular invasion (MVI), the prognosis remains poor, indicating a significant unmet need in this group.\n\nExternal Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) has shown promising results in treating HCC with MVI, especially when used in combination with trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE). It has been reported that radiotherapy may make tumor cells more susceptible to immune-mediated therapy, potentially enhancing the effects of atezolizumab and bevacizumab.\n\nThus, this study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab/bevacizumab alone versus atezolizumab/bevacizumab in combination with EBRT in HCC patients with macrovascular invasion.",

Summary: DNA vaccines, which are small pieces of DNA also known as plasmids, have several advantages over traditional vaccines such as live attenuated virus and recombinant protein-based vaccines. DNA vaccines appear to be well tolerated in humans. Therefore, the investigators have developed our DNA vaccine, VGX-3100, to include plasmids targeting E6 and E7 proteins of both HPV subtypes 16 and 18. The investigators have chosen to deliver our candidate vaccines via electroporation (EP) using the CELLECTRA constant current device to deliver a small electric charge following intramuscular (IM) injection, since animal studies have shown that this delivery method increases the immune response to our DNA vaccine leading to a decrease in the size of tumors caused by HPV 16 and 18. In study HPV-001, the vaccine was given to subjects with a history of CIN 2 and 3 who had been previously treated by surgery. This study is proposed to vaccinate the same subjects with a fourth dose of the VGX-3100 to determine the safety and immune response.",

Interventions: C7R.CD30.CAR-EBVST cells (BIOLOGICAL). Sponsor: Baylor College of Medicine. Summary: This study involves patients that have a cancer called diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL), or classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) (referred to collectively as lymphoma). Patients' lymphoma has come back or not gone away after treatment.\n\nA previous research study at Baylor combined two ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that bind to bacteria, viruses and other foreign substances to prevent disease. T-cells are special infection-fighting white blood cells that can kill tumor cells or cells infected with bacteria and viruses. Both have shown promise treating cancer, but neither has been strong enough to cure most patients. In the previous study, an antibody called anti-CD30 which is found on the surface of some T-cells and cancer cells, and had been used to treat lymphoma with limited success, was joined to the T-cells through a process called gene transfer, resulting in CD30.CAR T cells.\n\nAnother study saw encouraging responses using CD30.CAR T cells made in a lab from a patients' own blood then injected back into the same patient to treat their lymphoma. These cells are termed 'autologous' because they're given back to the original patient.\n\nIn an ongoing study, patients were treated with allogeneic CD30.CAR T cells, which are made from healthy donors instead of the patients. The use of allogenic cells avoids a lengthy manufacture time since the products are stored as a bank and available on demand. This ongoing trial has preliminarily shown promising clinical activity with no safety concerns.\n\nWith the current study, investigators plan to extend the anti-cancer effects of the CD30.CAR T cell by attaching another molecule called C7R, which has made CAR T cells have deeper and longer anticancer effects in the laboratory. The aim is to study the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic banked CD30.CAR-EBVST cells that also carry the C7R molecule, to learn the side effects of C7R modified CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in lymphoma patients, and to see whether this therapy may help them. As an extra safety step, the C7R containing T cells will also have a marker called iC9. If a patient experiences intolerable side effects from the C7R T cells, they could receive a medication called 'rimiducid' that can eliminate the C7R containing T cells by binding iC9, thereby potentially resolving the side effects. While not yet FDA approved, rimiducid has been tested in patients before without bad side effects.",

Conditions: Esophageal Cancer; Immunotherapy. Interventions: chronic psychological stress (OTHER). Sponsor: Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. Summary: Chronic stress refers to a special emotional state caused by unexpected stress for a long time, with an increasing incidence in the population. It can cause the body to release hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Tumor patients often experience changes such as psychological and emotional abnormalities, decreased quality of life, and impaired social relationships. Under stimulation, patients often experience negative reactions such as anxiety or depression. Epidemiological studies have shown that stress can affect the prognosis of malignant tumors, but the effect of stress on the efficacy and prognosis of esophageal cancer is still unclear.\n\nIn animal models, chronic stress leads to an increase in tissue catecholamine levels, increased tumor burden, and increased invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells in mouse models. At the same time, stress can promote tumor neovascularization in mice. However, the mechanism by which chronic stress affects the occurrence and development of esophageal cancer is currently unclear. In addition to neurohumoral factors, chronic stress can cause changes in the gut microbiota, which in turn affects the body's digestion, metabolism, and immune function. It is a key gatekeeper of the immune response to tumors. Therefore, gut microbiota as an intermediate factor may also affect the occurrence and prognosis of various types of esophageal cancer.",

Interventions: Tucatinib (DRUG); Trastuzumab (DRUG); Vinorelbine (DRUG). Sponsor: Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group. Summary: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common neoplasm in the world. In Spain, one in 8 women is diagnosed with BC. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive BC subtype (that represents around 20% of all BC) was associated with poor prognosis however, new therapeutic advances have significantly increased the cure rate of patients in early stages.\n\nIn the metastatic setting, anti-HER2 targeted therapies have significantly improved overall survival (OS) with good quality of life, however there is still a substantial group of patients who die, and therefore additional drugs need to be investigated.\n\nTrastuzumab, an anti HER2 antibody has demonstrated, in combination with chemotherapy, an improvement of OS in early and metastatic stages.\n\nTucatinib is an oral selective inhibitor of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase subunit. Its high affinity for this subunit causes fewer toxicities, such as rash and diarrhea, which are common with other anti-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\n\nVinorelbine has been evaluated previously in combination with trastuzumab showing interesting results.\n\nThis is a single country, multicenter, single arm phase II clinical trial with a safety run-in phase, to study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the administration of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine in HER2-positive non-resectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with measurable disease.",

Sponsor: National Cancer Institute (NCI). Summary: This phase III trial compares the effect of bevacizumab and osimertinib combination vs. osimertinib alone for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that has spread outside of the lungs (stage IIIB-IV) and has a change (mutation) in a gene called EGFR. The EGFR protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that control cell division and survival. Sometimes, mutations in the EGFR gene cause EGFR proteins to be made in higher than normal amounts on some types of cancer cells. This causes cancer cells to divide more rapidly. Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking EGFR that is needed for cell growth in this type of cancer. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Giving osimertinib with bevacizumab may control cancer for longer and help patients live longer as compared to osimertinib alone.",

Conditions: Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). Interventions: Transthoracic ultrasound-guided lung biopsy (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: University Hospital, Tours. Summary: Rationale Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) require accurate histological diagnosis when imaging is inconclusive, yet current techniques-surgical lung biopsy and transbronchial cryobiopsy-carry significant risks and lack real-time guidance. BPTE, widely used in oncology, provides ultrasound-guided sampling under local anesthesia with historically lower complication rates, but its value in ILD remains unproven. The TOUCANS study aims to generate safety and feasibility data to support its potential use as a less invasive diagnostic alternative.\n\nObjectives The primary objective is to assess the safety of BPTE in ILD patients, focusing on major adverse events: death, pneumothorax requiring drainage, hemorrhage requiring intervention, and prolonged pleural drainage. Secondary objectives include evaluating all complications within two months, comparing BPTE histological quality with surgical biopsy, and assessing pain, dyspnea, analgesic use, healing, drainage duration, and hematoma on thoracoscopic imaging.\n\nMaterials and Methods Fifteen patients aged 18-75 with ILD requiring tissue diagnosis after multidisciplinary review will be included. Exclusion criteria cover coagulation disorders, severe comorbidities, long-term oxygen therapy, impaired lung function, obesity, pulmonary hypertension, anesthetic allergy, and vulnerable populations. BPTE will be performed 2-4 weeks before surgical biopsy, under local anesthesia and spontaneous ventilation, with CT- and ultrasound-guided targeting. One or two biopsies will be taken, followed by ultrasound and chest X-ray monitoring; discharge occurs after four hours if stable. Surgical thoracoscopic biopsy will then be carried out with standard postoperative care. Pain, dyspnea, healing, and imaging findings will be recorded, and histological samples will be reviewed blindly. Data will be captured in eCRFs according to GDPR/CNIL requirements.\n\nExpected Outcomes TOUCANS will provide the first prospective evidence on BPTE for ILD. Demonstrating safety and adequate diagnostic yield could position BPTE as a minimally invasive, outpatient, ultrasound-guided alternative to surgical biopsy. This may shorten diagnostic pathways, reduce complications, and offer a viable option for patients unsuitable for surgery, ultimately improving early management and prognosis.",

Conditions: Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer. Interventions: Carboplatin (DRUG). Sponsor: Institute of Cancer Research, United Kingdom. Summary: Prostate cancer (PrCa) is one of the commonest cancer in men in the Western world. In the United Kingdom (UK), there were over 52,000 new cases diagnosed in 2016-2018 and a lifetime risk of 1 in 8. Research studies have identified several genetic changes that are thought to increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. Some of these genetic changes occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes. The BARCODE 2 trial is formed of two parts that aim to investigate how having genetic changes in DNA repair genes can affect response to carboplatin treatment in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In part 1 of the study, the investigators will invite men with mCRPC who have not had genetic testing before to join the study by initially undergoing genetic screening within the study. The DNA repair gene mutation carrier status of enrolled patients will be assessed using a gene panel. If a pathogenic mutation is confirmed in one of these genes, patients will be given the option to proceed to part 2 of the study. In part 2 of the study, men with mCRPC who are known to be carriers of a mutation in DNA repair gene(s) will be assessed for eligibility for treatment on the study with carboplatin chemotherapy. The aim of the study will be to determine how patients with mCRPC and a germline mutation in a DNA repair gene(s) respond to platinum chemotherapy. This study will help researchers to investigate platinum sensitivity of prostate tumours that have developed due to a germline mutation in a DNA repair gene. This study will provide data to use in a larger clinical trial of platinum chemotherapy based on patients' germline genetic signature and/or tumour genetic profile.",

Conditions: Brain Neoplasms; Glioma. Interventions: acoustic coupling fluid (BIOLOGICAL); Ringer's acetate (BIOLOGICAL). Sponsor: St. Olavs Hospital. Summary: Tools for improving brain tumor surgery, in particular for gliomas, are increasing. There seems to be an agreement that achieving extensive resections, when done safely without jeopardizing neurological function, improves survival.\n\nUltrasound is currently used as a tool for providing 2D or 3D images for tumor localization and resection control. For the use in resection control the resection cavity is filled with saline to provide acoustic coupling between the ultrasound transducer and tissue. However, attenuation of acoustic waves is very low in saline compared to the brain and this difference in attenuation is the cause of artifacts that may severely degrade the ultrasound images. Such artifacts are seen as high-intensity signal at the resection cavity wall and beyond. The artificial signal enhancement can potentially mask small tumor remnants and is generally making the interpretation of images more difficult.\n\nThis research group has developed an acoustic coupling fluid intended for use in the resection cavity instead of saline. Tests in laboratory measurements have shown that the fluid reduces artifacts and has the potential to enhance ultrasound image quality in brain tumor surgery. Three different concentrations of the acoustic coupling fluid have been tested in a phase 1 study that included 15 patients with glioblastoma. The concentration that provided the optimal ultrasound images, from qualitative and quantitative inspection, is used in the current phase II study. This study is a randomized controlled trial aiming to include 82 patients with glial brain tumours. Its purpose is to test the fluid during surgery of glial brain tumours to further investigate safety and efficacy.",

Interventions: Evaluation of systemic skin microvascular endothelial function (DIAGNOSTIC_TEST). Sponsor: National Institute of Cardiology, Laranjeiras, Brazil. Summary: Obesity is known to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal tract disease, respiratory problems (such as obstructive sleep apnea), joint and muscle problems, reproductive disorders, depression and cancer.\n\nHowever, recently a new classification has emerged about obesity, the metabolically healthy obesity (MHO). According to the definition of the term, MHO represents obesity that occurs segregated from the metabolic syndrome criteria defined by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). However, as there is still disagreement about the definition of MHO, the cardiovascular risk of these individuals is also uncertain. This phenotype may present as an intermediate risk between metabolically healthy normal-weight individuals and metabolically unhealthy obese individuals (MUO) or as a transition stage of the disease; when evolving to MUO, represents a higher risk of developing CVDs.\n\nThe hypothesis of the present study is that obese individuals classified as metabolically healthy have worse vascular endothelial function when compared to non-obese individuals, demonstrating increased cardiovascular risk even in this subgroup considered \"low risk\". The detection of endothelial dysfunction in metabolically healthy obese may help in the prevention, treatment and follow-up of these individuals, aiming to reduce the development and morbidity and mortality of CVD.\n\nIn the present study, the investigators will use a laser-based method for evaluating non-invasive, operator-independent systemic microvascular function that detects microvascular flow in the skin for the evaluation of systemic vascular endothelial function.",

Conditions: Adults; Hematological Malignancy; Oral Antineoplastic Agents. Interventions: Measure adherence behaviors (BEHAVIORAL). Sponsor: Jules Bordet Institute. Summary: Patients with haematologic malignancies are increasingly treated by Oral Anticancer Medications (OAMs), increasing the challenge of ensuring optimal adherence to treatment. However, except for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) or Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL), the extent of non-adherence has rarely been investigated in an outpatient setting. In Belgium, the only available data suffers from critical underrepresentation of patients from minority diverse population. In the context of increasing migration, the identification of differences in access and drug use that may lead to health disparities is crucial. Based on a sequential mixed method study design, our objectives are to measure adherence to OAMs in two subgroups of non-migrants and migrants with various haematological malignancies, to identify the associated risk factors and to explore the representations that come into play with regards to illness and adherence behaviors. Essentially, the MADESIO protocol will contribute to assess whether and why patients with migrant backgrounds are a risk group regarding adherence to OAMs.",

Conditions: Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor. Sponsor: University Hospital, Strasbourg, France. Summary: Neuroendocrine tumors represent a heterogeneous group of tumors, of which gastrointestinal (gastroenteropancreatic) NETs are the most frequent.\n\nTherapeutic management involves several approaches: control of any secretory syndrome and tumor control. Surgery is the first-line treatment for localized stages. When there is distant metastasis, various systemic treatments can be combined or administered sequentially (somatostatin analogs, everolimus, sunitinib, radioablation, targeted internal radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy). Gastrointestinal NETs are most often well-differentiated and slow-growing tumors with a median overall survival of up to 9 years (all sites combined), making comprehensive management of these patients all the more important.\n\nIn the context of cancer management, malnutrition has been shown to be associated with a poorer prognosis. Similarly, addressing malnutrition and improving nutritional parameters have been associated with improved prognosis.\n\nThe impact of nutritional status in patients with slow-growing tumors such as gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is less well understood but could be a modifiable factor for improving quality of life and treatment efficacy.\n\nThe research hypothesis is that nutritional status is associated with the prognosis of patients with gastrointestinal NETs.",

Conditions: Head and Neck Neoplasms; Radiotherapy Side Effect; Inflammation; Metabolism. Interventions: Radiotherapy (RADIATION). Sponsor: Uppsala University. Summary: An estimated 1500 people in Sweden will annually be diagnosed with head and neck cancer (HNC). Five year survival is approximately 69%. Long-term sequelae are common and in particular nutritional problems and fatigue. Radiotherapy (RT) is the cornerstone of treatment, either as single modality treatment or combined modality treatment. RT can induce immune responses at the site of tumor. It has been demonstrated that RT can lead to a strong systemic immune response . We have previously shown that an increase of conventional measures of systemic immune response to RT varied significantly across individuals. We predict that local immune response plays a major role in the antitumor effect. We also predict that a strong systemic immune response contributes to malnutrition and influence on survival. And malnutrition may lead to a worse response to RT.\n\nThe overall aim of this multicenter observational longitudinal study is to prospectively identify immunological and metabolic variables that affect the outcome of HNC patients. We will systematically investigate the local and systemic immune response induced by RT as well as explore alterations in metabolite composition induced by disease and treatment through global metabolite profiling. A platform for studies on immuno-metabolic changes in HNC patients has been established in the Uppsala-Orebro and Northern regions. Approximately 370 patients per year are eligible. Findings in this study can have implications on the development of personalized therapy in patients with HNC. The long-term benefit of the study will be the identification of measures for improved patient surveillance in order to improve the general and nutritional outcomes.",

Summary: Approximately 150 new cases of osteosarcoma are reported each year in France, of which 15 to 20% are metastatic.\n\nFurther to the initial standard care, about 45% of the patients relapse within a median duration of 20 months.\n\nResult of the OS94 study results and of the investigation performed within the CRLCC, indicate that 25 to 30 patients (children and adults) experience an osteosarcoma relapse each year in FRANCE.\n\nAccording to several studies, the 5-year overall survival rate of patients in first relapse is 23-28%,with a median post relapse survival of 10 to 17 months. Multiple relapse cases are also reported in the COSS study, with a median time to second relapse of 0.8 year.\n\nAt present, there is no reference treatment for the standard care of osteosarcoma relapse in FRANCE.\n\nThiotepa is known for its antitumor effect in numerous malignant tumors. In 2007, a study from our institution reported that about 35% of all osteosarcoma relapses are treated with a high-dose thiotepa while the efficacy and tolerance of this therapeutic strategy have never been assessed.\n\nThese results highlight the need to the evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of this high-dose of thiotepa within a clinical trial and its inclusion in the standard care of the osteosarcoma at relapse.",

Summary: Predicting response to chemotherapy in patients with Hodgkin's disease or lymphoma high-grade malignant de novo or recurrence.\n\nThe non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and high-grade Hodgkin's disease may show resistance to chemotherapy, regardless of their initial extension. The failure of treatment is most often correlated with an incomplete answer or lack of response to chemotherapy as a result chemoresistance. This drug, which may involve the gene MDR1 (multidrug resistance) encoding the protein PGP, can be studied in vivo by MIBI scan. The MIBI is behind a tracer perfusionnel used routinely to explore myocardial perfusion, but it has other characteristics of fixing, which can be used in oncological imaging (fixation by glial tumors of high grade).Prospective Study, which includes conducting a tomoscintigraphie 30 minutes after injection of 20 mCi of 99mTc-MIBI in initial stock or relapse of high-grade lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease any stage (I-IV). Fixing the MIBI is compared with morphological abnormalities detected by CT and the setting of lesions by 18FDG. Patients will be treated in a traditional way, without changes in treatment protocols used in routine. Patients with a negative MIBI scan, will be watched with particular attention in order to detect insufficient response to chemotherapy. The only change, the care of patients, only for the achievement of an initial consideration of non-invasive imaging, further, which is the tomoscintigraphie the MIBI. Of the tumor samples, will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry, the expression of PGP and the MRP1 (two proteins associated with the drug). On blood, may be carried out genotyping of MDR1, MRP1 and MRP2 to the patient.",

Summary: Background:\n\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder. It has a broad variety of effects on the body. Up to half of people with NF1 get plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). These are benign tumors. But they can have serious effects like pain and disfigurement. To treat PNs, a person may have to take medicine every day for a long period of time. Researchers think that it will be important for people to take the medicine regularly for it to work. They want to study how well people with NF1 follow their treatment plan for PNs.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study how often people with neurofibromatosis type 1 take medicine that has been prescribed to them for treating plexiform neurofibromas.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 3-59 already enrolled in an NF1 clinical trial\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will need access to the internet to do the study activities.\n\nParents or caregivers will do some study activities for child participants.\n\nParticipants will complete 5 questionnaires. They will take about 20 minutes total. The topics will be:\n\nDemographic data\n\nRecent life events\n\nHow much pain interferes with daily life\n\nAbility to focus and pay attention to tasks\n\nEmotional distress or depression\n\nParticipants will mark down every time they take a dose of the medicine in their clinical trial. They will use a form the researchers give them. The pill bottles they get in their trial will have a chip in the cap that will record when it is opened. Participants will keep a daily diary of their medicine. Their pills will be counted at clinical trial visits.\n\nParticipants may have more short questionnaires.

Summary: The goal of this clinical research study is to learn which chemotherapy combination may be more effective in treating locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The side effects of these combinations will also be studied.\n\nThis study treatment consists of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent chemotherapy. For study chemotherapy, patients will be randomized between cisplatin or the combination of docetaxel and cetuximab. Subjects will be stratified depending on HPV status and the presence of ERCC-1 \\[4F9\\] in the tumor prior to randomization. The study will evaluate cisplatin vs. docetaxel-cetuximab in the overall population, and test which radiation and chemotherapy combination works best in relationship to how much ERCC-1 \\[4F9\\] is expressed in a tumor.",

Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING. Conditions: Breast Cancer; Nipple Discharge. Sponsor: Hubei Cancer Hospital. Summary: This is a prospective, single-center diagnostic study testing whether a new, minimally invasive analysis of nipple fluid can distinguish benign from malignant causes of pathologic nipple discharge. Many patients with bloody or blood-tinged nipple discharge undergo surgery to make a diagnosis, yet most are ultimately found to have benign disease. The investigators aim to develop a laboratory test that analyzes DNA in nipple fluid to help avoid unnecessary operations while still identifying cancers.\n\nApproximately 30 adults with spontaneous, single-duct, unilateral bloody or serosanguinous nipple discharge who are already scheduled for standard diagnostic surgery will be enrolled at Hubei Cancer Hospital. Before surgery, the investigators will collect a small sample of nipple fluid (or gently obtain nipple aspirate fluid using a soft suction cup if needed) and one tube of blood. The investigators will analyze the fluid's DNA using two approaches: low-pass whole-genome analysis to look for copy number changes and fragmentation patterns, and genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. Surgical pathology will serve as the reference standard. Using these data, the investigators will build and validate a model to classify lesions as benign or malignant.\n\nThe primary outcome is diagnostic accuracy (area under the ROC curve, sensitivity, and specificity). Secondary outcomes include positive and negative predictive values, model calibration, subgroup performance (e.g., ductal carcinoma in situ vs invasive cancer), and an estimate of potential clinical impact (for example, how many benign cases might safely avoid surgery at a high-sensitivity threshold). Study test results will not affect current clinical care; all participants will receive usual evaluation and surgery. Risks are minimal and may include brief nipple discomfort or skin irritation from gentle suction and routine blood-draw risks (bruising, lightheadedness). There is no direct benefit to participants, but the findings may support a future noninvasive test to guide care and reduce unnecessary surgery. Data will be de-identified and stored securely. Expected enrollment is from September 2025 to May 2026.",

Sponsor: Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. Summary: Preoperative neoadjuvant therapy has become the guideline-recommended standard treatment for patients with locally advanced or mid-to-low rectal cancer with suspected regional lymph node metastasis. However, preoperative neoadjuvant radiotherapy caused radiation damage to the pelvic bowel, resulting in varying degrees of edema, vascular stiffness, and insufficient blood supply. According to the traditional rectal cancer surgery, the proximal bowel resection only needs to be more than 10cm above the upper edge of the tumor. However, this range of resection cannot remove all the damaged proximal bowel, and using the damaged proximal bowel for anastomosis may lead to the risk of anastomotic-related complications (including anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stenosis, and anastomotic proximal bowel stiffness, etc.) also increased. Therefore, extended resection of the proximal bowel with splenic flexure mobilization and using healthy proximal bowel for anastomosis may help reduce the incidence of complications related to rectal anastomosis after neoadjuvant therapy.",

Summary: Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) is a modern RT technique that delivers high doses of radiation to small tumor targets using highly conformal techniques, while trying to avoid healthy tissues and organs. However, SABR treatment requires increased planning, treatment time, cost and potential for higher toxicity due to the higher dose. The purpose of this study is to compare single fraction (SF) SABR vs. multiple fraction (MF) SABR in regards to toxicities, progression-free survival, quality of life (QoL), and cost-effectiveness. In a subset of patients, we will also compare patient QoL, hospitalization rates, and cost-effectiveness between patients who complete QoL questionnaires, record symptoms and receive healthcare provider-guided intervention vs. patients who complete QoL questionnaires only.",

Status: COMPLETED. Phase: NA. Conditions: Breast Cancer. Interventions: Cognitive stimulation sessions coupled with Adapted Physical Activity sessions. (OTHER). Sponsor: Centre Francois Baclesse. Summary: Investigator general objective is therefore to study and compare the benefit of several methods of management of cognitive difficulties reported by patients during treatment for breast cancer, among several treatments, offered independently in patients' homes and supervised from a distance: adapted physical activity only, cognitive stimulation only, and adapted physical activity coupled with cognitive stimulation (during separate sessions). The study will therefore be the first to include a group benefiting from these two management methods, which will make it possible to assess the individual benefit of cognitive stimulation sessions and adapted physical activity but also the benefit of combined sessions.As this type of combined management has never been the subject of a study, and previous studies relating to a single type of management having raised patient adhesion difficulties, it does not seem certain that this type of care is feasible in practice. Before studying its effectiveness, it is therefore essential to check the feasibility and acceptability of such a program combining sessions of adapted physical activity and cognitive stimulation sessions.Investigator will therefore first carry out a feasibility study, longitudinal and monocentric, which will assess the adherence of patients treated for breast cancer to the performance of cognitive stimulation sessions coupled with sessions of adapted physical activity.This feasibility study is a key stage of the Cog-Stim protocol because its results will probably highlight the obstacles to the intervention program, which will allow the investigator to propose adjustments to improve the study design for the following stages of the protocol.

Status: COMPLETED. Phase: NA. Conditions: Aromatase Inhibitor; Musculoskeletal Symptoms; Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Survivors. Interventions: APA (OTHER); Sham APA control (OTHER); Education control (OTHER). Sponsor: Johns Hopkins University. Summary: Aromatase inhibitor therapy has become a standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Up to 50% of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors exhibit significant aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms, defined as severe joint pain and stiffness. Aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms in turn has a negative effect on the women's physical function and quality of life, leading to discontinued aromatase inhibitor therapy and causing significant social and economic burden. Given aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms' profound effects, the management of aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms is an essential component in cancer care.\n\nThe investigators propose to test auricular point acupressure- -an innovative, non-invasive, nonpharmacologic, and low-cost intervention- -to manage aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms in breast cancer survivors. Auricular point acupressure applies an acupuncture-like stimulation to ear acupoints without using a needle (i.e., seeds are taped to the acupoints) to treat illness/symptoms. Auricular point acupressure is particularly well suited for current challenges of unmet aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms management. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to (1) determine the efficacy of auricular point acupressure in relieving aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms, and (2) examine the inflammatory signaling of auricular point acupressure effects in breast cancer survivors treated with aromatase inhibitor. The investigators will also measure psychological, behavioral, personal, and social factors that may moderate or mediate the effects of auricular point acupressure. The investigators also believe inflammatory cytokines may partially explain the mechanism of action of auricular point acupressure for improved aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms and physical function, and plan to measure these.\n\nThis study will identify a novel approach to manage aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, with minimal side effects. If successful, the paradigm of pain management will shift from a traditional medical model to a larger integrative medicine and patient-management paradigm to avoid unnecessary evolution towards prolonged disability.",

Interventions: Atezolizumab (DRUG); ONC201 (DRUG). Sponsor: UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Summary: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the fourth most common cancer in United States women, and alarmingly, the frequency and mortality from EC continues to rise, in part due to the obesity epidemic. Obese women with EC have a 6.3-fold increased risk of death from this disease, as compared to their non-obese counterparts. Patients with advanced/recurrent EC are unlikely to be cured by surgery, conventional chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin is the standard first-line treatment), radiation, or a combination of these. Thus, new treatments for EC are desperately needed as well as a better understanding of the impact of obesity on EC biology and treatment.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to test the safety of a combination of treatments, atezolizumab and ONC201, given based on body weight, to treat endometrial cancer. Using the combination of atezolizumab and ONC201, has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of endometrial cancer. This clinical trial will examine the treatment of atezolizumab + ONC201 in obese and non-obese subjects with metastatic/recurrent EC.",

Conditions: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Esophagus. Interventions: BIBW2992 (DRUG). Sponsor: Yonsei University. Summary: As a 2nd generation EGFR-TKI that irreversibly binds to EGFR receptors, afatinib showed the possibility of superior effects to 1st generation TKIs such as erlotinib and gefitinib. In a phase III study LUX-lung 3 in patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, afatinib monotherapy showed longer progression-free disease survival time of 11.1 months than that (6.9 months) of pemetrexed/cisplatin combination therapy. Based on such the results, it is currently recommended as the standard first-line treatment for EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer, and clinical studies are also being actively conducted in other types of carcinomas characterized by EGFR gene mutation and overexpression. Thirty (30) solid cancer patients were included in a phase I trial of afatinib, and of them, a patient with esophageal cancer had partial response. Taken together, based upon the results from clinical trials of afatinib conducted so far, 7 out of 15 esophageal cancer patients achieved clinical responses of 3 months or longer.\n\nHence, the overall results from previous studies of gefitinib and erlotinib as EGFR TKIs and our study of dacomitinib, as well as from preceding studies of afatinib - a 2nd generation EGFR TKI - suggest the possibility of an effective therapy in esophageal cancer characterized by well-known EGFR overexpression. In this phase II trial, afatinib shall be administered to patients with squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus to evaluate its effects and toxicity. Also, biomarkers to predict responses to afatinib shall be explored through further studies.",

Conditions: Solid Tumor; Colitis; Arthritis. Interventions: Tocilizumab (RoACTEMRA\u00ae) (DRUG). Sponsor: Herlev Hospital. Summary: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) might induce inflammatory potentially serious and even lethal immune related Adverse Events (irAEs). Diarrhea and/or colitis are ones of the most frequently reported irAEs in patients taking ICI. Although the immune mechanisms underlying irAEs have not been fully elucidated, studies suggest that Th17 and Tregs cells, increases in expression of immunologically-related genes, eosinophilia, microbiome among others and cytokines may be involved in the pathophysiology of immune-related complications in some diseases that resemble irAEs, such as colitis and rheumatic manifestations. Importantly, interleukin-6 (IL-6) promotes the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells (17), and IL-6 inhibition may rebalance the altered Th17-Treg axis without inhibiting the Th1-CD8+ T-cell subsets that govern antitumor immunity. These findings raise the possibility of using IL-6 blockade as a strategy for treating colitis and arthritis induced by immune checkpoint blockade.",

Summary: The purpose and the goal of this paper is to show whether the application of a combination of two local anesthetics, as opposed to the application of one local anesthetic at paravertebral block changes the hemodynamic variable. It is therefore a prospective randomized double- blind study, where we do a clinical trial in patients ASA(American Society of Anesthesiologists) 1 and 2 statuses between 18 and 80 years of age, using the ultrasound in plane technology.Upon arrival of patients in the unit for preparation procedures for anesthesia we set the ECG(electrocardiograph), noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and arterial cannula in the radial artery After sterile washing of the dorsal surface, paravertebral space was identified with ultrasound using 8 Hz(hertz) linear transducer probe then needle position was confirmed with neurostimulation at the level of 2.0 - 5.0 mA(milliampere). When muscle contraction persisted at 0.4mA(milliampere), the anesthetic was applied in levels of Th 2, Th3, and Th 4 (7,0 milliliters per level). We applied the 0.5 % levobupivacaine and 2 % lidocaine, 7,0 milliliters of mixture per level in one group, while only 0.5 % levobupivacaine also 7,0 milliliters. by level in the second one. After that, the invasive hemodynamic monitoring was placed on patients and the induction with 1 % propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg.and Vecuronium 0,08 mg/kg. was performed with the application of supraglottic airway gel of appropriate size. The maintenance of anesthesia and sedation will be conducted with Propofol 1 % continuously ( 25-150 mcg / kg / min.)The measurements will be taken every 5 minutes during the first hour of the application of paravertebral block, then every 15 minutes during the second hour and if the operation takes more than two hours, the measurements are performed every 30 minutes. Postoperatively, invasive hemodynamic monitoring will be removed in post-anesthesia recovery room together with the arterial cannula and the patient will be sent to the hospital ward with non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure, pulse, saturation) until the termination of the blocks.Statistical methods, By comparing two target groups, we analysed the strength of the test with following assumptions: X2 difference test, the expected difference in variances in stroke volume between groups of 60%, \u03b1 significance level of 0.05, and the minimum statistical test strength of 85%. The required total sample should include at least 80 patients, that is, 40 per group.Data will be presented in tables and graphs. Descriptive statistics of examined variables with appropriate measures of central tendency will be made. Smirnov -Kolmogorov test will assess the normality of data distribution. According to the received results, the appropriate parametric and / or nonparametric tests will be used. Comparisons of quantitative values between the two groups will be analyzed using the independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Dependent values within each group will be analyzed using analysis of variance for repeated measures or Friedman test. Differences in categorical values will be analyzed by X2 test. The appropriate regression model will be made in order to predict the variability of stroke volume in which the dependent variable will be a variation of the stroke volume, while relevant clinical values will be taken as predictor variables. All P values smaller than 0.05 will be considered significant.\n\nThis research is to present the main results - the existence of the significant change in Stroke Volume Variation (SVV) between groups using invasive hemodynamic monitoring, the changes of Stroke Volume Variation(SVV) depending on the time from the application within groups, differences in volume compensation of crystalloids and colloids and the need for the application of vasoactive drugs. Furthermore, as a secondary results we will present the time to maximal block development, the duration of post operative analgesia, patient satisfaction and time needed for the full recovery from the block.",

Status: TERMINATED. Phase: PHASE2. Conditions: Breast Neoplasms. Interventions: Positron Emission Tomography Imaging (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: AHS Cancer Control Alberta. Summary: Breast cancer affects many women. One of the places to which it can spread is the lymph glands under the arm. The type of treatment offered to patients often will depend on whether those lymph glands have cancer in them or not. For this reason, a standard recommendation is that women with breast cancer have these lymph glands removed with surgery. This cancer causes side effects including numbness, pain, decreased ability to move the arm and arm swelling. A new type of surgery which looks only at the first gland that a cancer drains to (sentinel node biopsy) may help to avoid having to remove the glands under the arm. Also, a new way of imaging the glands under the arm called Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning may also give a better idea of the chance that these glands have cancer in them. This study is determining whether PET scans before surgery and sentinel node biopsy can decrease the need for a complete axillary dissection.",

Interventions: Genistein (DRUG). Sponsor: Sofya Pintova. Summary: Colorectal neoplasms are the third most common malignancies in the United States. Patients with metastatic (stage IV) colorectal cancer have a median life expectancy of 2 years. The response rates to chemotherapy range from 35-40%.\n\nEpidemiologic evidence suggests that soy compounds may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancers. Laboratory analyses demonstrate that genistein, a soy-derived compound, may inhibit Wnt signaling, a pathway activated in majority of colorectal cancers. Laboratory observations also demonstrate that genistein may augment growth inhibition when combined with chemotherapeutic agents of 5-Fluorouracil and platinum compounds.\n\nBased on pre-clinical data the investigators hypothesize that combining genistein with the standard of care chemotherapeutic regimens will reduce chemotherapy resistance and improve response rates in patients. The aim of the study is to add genistein to the regimens of FOLFOX or FOLFOX-Avastin in patients with newly diagnosed stage IV colon or rectal neoplasms.",

Summary: In this study the investigators will advance research on the development of easy to use technologies to empower patients. This is a scalable approach that has a significant potential to reduce suffering for palliative care patients and their caregivers. The investigators will adapt existing tested empathic conversational agents (ECA) for home-based cancer care management and inpatient bedside counseling to provide the following functions:\n\n1. medication counseling;\n2. physical activity promotion;\n3. symptom management and continual screening for adverse events; and\n4. alleviation of stress and anxiety\n5. spiritual needs assessment; and\n6. advanced care planning.\n\nData from the system will be monitored by a health professional, who communicates with members of the patient's care team. In this project, this activity will include facilitating referral for palliative care services.\n\nThe investigators will conduct pilot studies both at Boston Medical Center and at Northeastern University that will test system usability (Northeastern University and BMC) as well as interview burden (BMC only).\n\nThe investigators will conduct a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) to evaluate the agent technology, comparing usual care (UC) versus usual care plus the agent (UC+ECA) for patients 21 or older, with a life expectancy of \\< 1 year, from outpatient clinics at Boston Medical Center (BMC). Each subject will be enrolled along with a caregiver surrogate subject. In addition to baseline data collection, there will be monthly phone surveys for six months; intervention subjects will use the system for a six-month period of time. In addition, the investigators will conduct a randomized trial within the intervention group to compare subjects getting functions 1-4 (above) versus subjects getting the augmented intervention with all six functions. The intervention will include a nurse management interface to monitor clinical alerts generated by the system to stimulate interventions by the clinical staff.",

It is hoped that the rapid treatment start with the initial 3D CRT plan will lessen clinical deterioration due to the growth of these aggressive tumours. The use of Linac-based IMRT in Phase II of the patient's treatment plan will maintain the benefit of the sophistication of IMRT.\n\nUsing novel PET imaging we also hope to better characterize regions of glioma cells thus producing more optimized planning target volumes (PTVs) for each patient and decreasing the volume of normal brain irradiated with the aim of minimizing radiation toxicities.

    "search_text": "Clinical trial: Yield of Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS-FNA) With and Without the Use of a Stylet in the Biopsy Needle. Status: COMPLETED. Phase: NA. Conditions: Pancreatic Mass on Imaging. Interventions: Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (PROCEDURE); Stylet out FNA first, Stylet in FNA second (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: University of British Columbia. Summary: Purpose:\n\nTo compare the diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) in patient with pancreatic masses with and without the use of a stylet in place within the biopsy needle.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nIn patients undergoing an EUS FNA for pancreatic indications, patients having a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) without the internal stylet will have a greater diagnostic yield compared to those with the internal stylet.\n\nJustification:\n\nEUS-FNA is an increasingly important means of obtaining tissue samples from lesions within the thorax and abdomen. In experienced hands EUS-FNA is a safe alternative to more invasive procedures such as mediastinoscopy or laparoscopy. EUS-FNA can be used for sampling suspected cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic masses or cysts, submucosal gastric lesions, peripancreatic, perigastric or mediastinal lymph nodes and in some cases adrenal or liver masses. Therefore, it is a powerful tool for both diagnosis and tumour staging. For example, for the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is a common indication for EUS-FNA, the sensitivity varies from 75 to \\>90%, with a specificity of 82-100% and a mean accuracy of 85%. Improving the diagnostic yield may lead to an earlier diagnosis with a reduced number of investigations and earlier institution of treatment for the patient.\n\nThe FNA needle system consists of a 22 or 19 gauge needle which is manipulated by a handle piston that attaches to the biopsy channel of the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) linear scope. The tip of the needle has grooves to disperse ultrasound waves making the tip of the needle easily seen. The sample is taken by inserting a specially designed needle into the area of interest under EUS guidance. Inside the needle is a removable stylet with a rounded or bevelled tip to facilitate the passage of the needle into the tissue. The usual practice is for the stylet to be extracted after the needle has been passed into its optimum position within the tissue and for it to be re-inserted before each pass. However, a recent prospective trial with 111 patients, published in abstract form, found this approach was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of adequate samples compared to when the stylet was removed before passing the needle. Although there was no significant difference in the diagnostic yield between the two groups this study raises the issue that the stylet left in place is to the detriment of the tissue sample and, ultimately, may reduce the diagnostic yield or increase the number of passes needed to obtain a satisfactory sample.\n\nOne limitation to this study includes the heterogenous patient population. Yields of EUS-FNA vary considerably depending on the type of tissue being biopsied. The second limitation is that consecutive patients were randomized to having the stylet removed versus having the stylet not removed at the time of FNA. There is no control group from which to compare the two groups. An improvement in the study design would be to have each patient to be their own control group. Successive passes of the FNA needle can increase the bloodiness of the sample, so randomization of the order in which each group is done will help eliminate potential bias.\n\nIt is clear from the current published literature that removing the stylet increases the cellularity of the sample. However, this increased cellularity may be the result of more contamination from the GI tract through which the FNA needle needs to pass in order to get an extra-luminal sample. Blood or a traumatic FNA can also lead to increased cellularity that can compromise diagnostic accuracy.\n\nDiagnostic yield depends on both adequacy of the sample and enough cells from the lesion to interpret. A preliminary result based on an air dried slide often can lead to fewer FNA passes if a diagnosis can be made. If this is not possible, a cell block preparation is made from all the washings from the EUS-FNA needle. No study has examined the diagnostic accuracy of these two types of samples using an EUS-FNA needle with and without the stylet within the same patient.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo determine if the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA is increased if the stylet is removed from the FNA needle compared with leaving it in place.",

Conditions: Gastrointestinal Imaging With pCLE. Interventions: Buscopan (DRUG); Scopolamine (DRUG); physiological saline (DRUG). Sponsor: Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases. Summary: Gastrointestinal cancer has developed into a serious health problem in China. 80%-90% patients were detected at middle and later stage. The five-year survival rate for advanced cancer patients is less than 10%. The main reason of the bad clinical diagnosis and treatment is that the present technical method is difficult to achieve early diagnosis. Endoscopy with biopsy is still the main method for confirming gastrointestinal cancer. But it is limited to identify early tumors and it leads to the low diagnostic rate of early tumors and the poor overall therapeutic effect.\n\nConfocal laser endoscopy (CLE) can obtain pathologic information of lesion in real time and improve the diagnostic rate of early tumors. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy(pCLE) is a new technology recently. Since its laser probe is applicable to all conventional endoscopes, pCLE greatly increased its clinical application. However, gastrointestinal motility has greatly influence on pCLE imaging quality and inspection effect owing to the poor stability of the small probe manipulation. Scopolamine (654-2, in China) is clinically used to inhibit bowel peristalsis, but its effect is still not ideal and its side effects are common.",

Conditions: AML, Adult Recurrent; MDS. Interventions: DVX201 (BIOLOGICAL). Sponsor: Coeptis Therapeutics. Summary: This study involves the use of an investigational cell therapy known as DVX201. DVX201 is an investigational cell therapy that contains a type of white blood cell called natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are a normal part of your immune system and have a lifespan of only about two weeks. They are called natural killer cells because they have the natural ability to identify and kill cells in the body that are abnormal, like cancer cells or virally infected cells. But fighting cancer can also lead to exhaustion and abnormal function of NK cells. It can also result in a significant decrease in the number of NK cells in the blood, making it more difficult for the immune system to control the disease. We believe that infusion of healthy, functional NK cells into patients with AML or MDS may boost the immune system and help by killing cancer cells that remain after chemotherapy. DVX201 is an investigational NK cell therapy that may provide a rapid and temporary source of healthy NK cells that are better able to fight those cancer cells.",

Summary: This phase III trial tests the side effects of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) compared to hypofractionated radiotherapy for treating patients with prostate adenocarcinoma that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to a limited number of sites (oligometastatic). SBRT is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors in the body (except the brain). The total dose of radiation is divided into smaller doses given over several days. This type of radiation therapy helps spare normal tissue. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumors cells and have fewer side effects. SBRT may work just as well as hypofractionated radiation therapy at treating patients with biochemically recurrent or oligometastatic prostate cancer, but with a shorter treatment time and possibly fewer side effects.",

Interventions: Diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) (DRUG). Sponsor: Rockefeller University. Summary: Melanoma is a life-threatening cancer which poses a significant health burden, especially when metastatic or spreading to areas other than the original tumor growth. Although various treatment options are currently available for melanoma, melanomas that have metastasized widely to the skin pose a significant clinical challenge as the available therapies have limited effect. This study proposes the use of a topically applied compound named diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) which has been shown to be effective in treating melanoma patients whose diseases have spread widely throughout the skin. DPCP works by having a patient's own immune system, which is usually used to fight infections, attack cancerous cells. This compound has commonly been used to treat other conditions such as warts and hair loss throughout the world for many years and is known to cause limited side effects. Altering a patient's own immune system through topical treatments has also been shown to benefit patients with other cancers that have metastasized to skin such as breast cancer. In this study, the investigators will use DPCP to treat cutaneous metastases of various cancers including melanoma. Our overall intention is to get a better understanding of effective immune responses in the skin that may mediate metastatic cancer regression or cure.",

PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumors to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120 together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells",

Conditions: Rhinitis; Sinusitis; Nasal Polyps. Sponsor: Hillel Yaffe Medical Center. Summary: An explosion of interest in the numerous therapeutic properties of Punica granatum over the last decade has led to numerous in vitro, animal, and clinical trials. Pomegranate is a potent antioxidant, superior to red wine and equal to or better than green tea. In addition, anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties suggest its possible use as a therapy or adjunct for prevention and treatment of several types of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Because of pomegranate's antimicrobial properties, it may aid in preventing infection by dental pathogens, pathogenic E. coli O157:H7, and antibiotic-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Pomegranate's effect on bacterial pathogens has only been tested in vitro, however, necessitating human trials to refute or substantiate any clinical effect.\n\nThe possibility that pomegranate extracts may also have an effect on several other disease processes, such as Alzheimer's and obesity, underscores the need for more clinical research. Currently, numerous clinical trials are in progress exploring the therapeutic potential of pomegranate extracts.\n\nAim The investigators want to evaluate the effect of Punica granatum components on Chronic sinusitis, nasal polyps and chronic rhinitis.",

Interventions: Elective neck dissection in early oral cancer (PROCEDURE); Therapeutic Neck Dissection (PROCEDURE). Sponsor: Tata Memorial Hospital. Summary: Cervical nodal metastasis is the single most important prognostic factor in head and neck cancers. Appropriate management of the neck is therefore of paramount importance in the treatment of these cancers. While it is obvious that the positive neck must be treated, controversy has always surrounded the clinically node negative neck with respect to the ideal treatment policy.The situation is difficult with regards to early cancers of the oral cavity (T1/T2). These cancers are usually treated with surgery where excision is through the per-oral route. Elective neck dissection in such a situation is an additional surgical procedure with its associated costs, prolonged hospitalization and may be unnecessary in as high as 80% of patients who finally turn out to be pathologically node negative. Should the neck be electively treated or there be a wait and watch policy? Current practice is that the neck is always addressed whenever there is an increased propensity to cervical metastasis or when patient follow-up is unreliable.\n\nThere is clearly a need therefore for a large randomized trial that will resolve the issue either way once and for all.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo demonstrate whether elective neck dissection (END) is equal or superior to the wait and watch policy i.e.\n\ntherapeutic neck dissection (TND) in the management of the clinically No neck in early T1 /T2 cancers of the oral cavity.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\n1. Does Ultrasound examination have any role in the routine initial workup of a node negative patient?\n2. How are patients ideally followed up -does sonography have a role or is clinical examination sufficient.\n3. Is assessment of tumor thickness by the surgeon at the time of initial surgery accurate -Is there a correlation\n4. Identify histological prognostic factors in the primary that may help identify a sub-set of patients at an increased risk for cervical metastasis.",

Sponsor: GlaxoSmithKline. Summary: Gene and cell therapies have a real value potential (example: potential long-term effect, curative potential, and single administration) but also drawbacks (example: treatment perceived as complex and risky generating fear and anxiety in subjects and their family; high cost) that require significant educational efforts and planning for optimal market access. It is therefore important to understand subject and physician perceptions of T-Cell Receptor (TCR) therapies. The aim of this study is to collect qualitative data from a small but diverse sample of oncologists and subjects in the United States to gather qualitative evidence for a preliminary understanding about their perceptions of T-cell therapies in the treatment of cancer. This cross-sectional study will involve up to 20 adult subjects with cancer and up to 20 oncologists/hematologist-oncologists in the United States. Eligible subjects will be scheduled for a telephone interview lasting approximately 60-90 minutes. Eligible oncologists will be scheduled for a telephone interview lasting approximately 60 minutes.\n\nSearching social media is another way of understanding the perceptions of prescribers and consumers of CGT, in addition to interviews being conducted under the original protocol. The results of a feasibility assessment suggested that it would be helpful to explore social media to add to the findings from the interviews. This social media study(SMS) is being conducted as a pilot study to hone methods for future explorations of social media. The pilot study will investigate and describe initial themes emerging from existing discussions related to CGT. Findings from this work will help GlaxoSmithKline to plan future work in the social media landscape.",

Interventions: Muse MRgFUS System (DEVICE). Sponsor: University of Utah. Summary: This is an open-label, single arm, single center, non-randomized feasibility study of the Muse MRgFUS System in subjects with breast cancer. Subjects will undergo partial ablation of half (\u226450%) of one of their tumors (if multifocal or multicentric disease) followed by surgical resection per standard of care. The partial tumor ablation design will ensure that no information is lost that would impact the subject's standard of clinical care. Because current care often includes testing on the tumor, retaining a portion of viable tumor is advised by the clinical team. To ensure viable tissue confirmation, patients will be enrolled in two cohorts as described in the protocol. The investigators will use imaging correlation, histological evaluation, and subject reported outcomes to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the Muse MRgFUS System. This proposed study will adhere to the guidelines of subjects receiving a timely tumor resection after diagnosis. All subjects will undergo the definitive procedure of surgical resection per standard of care. Surgical resection cannot be delayed as a result of the ablation and should occur within 6 weeks after the decision to proceed with surgical resection. In cases where a surgery may occur outside of the 6 week window, prior approval from the external DSMC should be obtained. While MRgFUS ablation is designed to be a breast-conserving technique, the investigators will enroll patients that are undergoing any surgical resection, including both lumpectomy or mastectomy. Both surgical procedures will allow assessment of the defined primary, secondary and exploratory objectives.",

Patients were aged 50-74 years at histologically confirmed primary invasive (stages I to IV) or in situ breast tumor (stage 0). Comprehensive information on demographic, socio-economic, and lifestyle factors was collected at multiple time points: at recruitment by a standardized face-to-face interview and at follow-up median 6 years as well as 11 years later using computer assisted telephone interview.\n\nVital status was assessed in 2009 and again in 2015 via the population registries and causes of death were obtained from death certificates and coded according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10).\n\nInformation on the clinical course was abstracted from medical records to verify clinical events either self-reported in follow-up interviews or reported by treating physicians.\n\nThe studies were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Heidelberg and the University of Hamburg and conducted in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent was provided by all participants at baseline and during follow-up.\n\nThe primary objectives of this study are\n\n* To assess the association of modifiable lifestyle factors and personal factors, including BMI, diet, physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use, menopausal hormone therapy, socioeconomic status, with breast cancer survival, overall and according to tumor type, after accounting for established prognostic factors.\n* To examine the influence of genetic variants on breast cancer relapse and survival\n* To assess the association of lifestyle factors and their changes in the course of survivorship on subsequent breast cancer prognosis.\n* To assess the individual and combined association of inflammation/metabolic biomarkers as well as changes in their serum levels with subsequent breast cancer prognosis overall and according to tumor type.\n* To assess whether and to what extent the associations between breast cancer prognosis and lifestyle factors and/or their changes are mediated by circulating biomarker levels.",

Summary: Conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is currently the therapeutic standard for patient with Breast Cancer. Symptoms are common among patients receiving this treatment. Ten percent of them will develop severe and chronic radio-induced toxicities, such as breast radio-induced-fibrosis impairing their quality of life (QoL). Yet, paying attention to symptom improves the empowerment and psychological adjustment to the disease. Web-based systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been shown to prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control, and to enhance patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being.Benefits of systems to elicit e-PRO improve reliable measure of health-related quality of life (QoL) remains discussed.\n\nTo date, there are few specific treatments for these severe radio-induced fibrosis except the antifibrotic combinaison Pentoxifylline/Vitamin E with inconsistent result.\n\nSince 2000, we and others have developed a mechanistic approach modulating the severity of RIF by targeting the Rho/ROCK/CTGF pathway, especially by inhibiting Rho activation by pravastatin. Our preclinical data, then followed by the Phase II PRAVACUR-01 trial, concluded that the use of pravastatin has an anti-fibrotic action on different experimental models and reduces the severity of the grade of fibrosis in 50% of patients.\n\nPatients can now benefit from this new anti-fibrotic agent.\n\nTaken as a whole, these data encourage combining both drug (pravastatin) and non-pharmacological intervention , in particular e-PRO, in the RIF management.",

Phase: NA. Conditions: Hepatocellular Carcinoma; Perfusion Scanner. Interventions: Scannographic evaluation of the tumor response performed with mRECIST criteria after 3 months of treatment with sorafenib (OTHER). Sponsor: Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Amiens. Summary: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular tumor. The reference treatment of advanced forms of stage C according to the Barcelona classification (BCLC C) is sorafenib, a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor with predominant anti-angiogenic action. In order not to underestimate the efficacy of sorafenib, scannographic evaluation of the tumor response should be performed with mRECIST criteria that are significantly better correlated with survival. These criteria take into account the tumor size and also the modification of the tumor contrast enhancement after anti-angiogenic treatment. It seems appropriate to evaluate tumor control rather than tumor response since sorafenib is more stable than tumor response.\n\nThis evaluation will be made according to the mRECIST criteria after 3 months of treatment since the progression-free survival is of the order of 3 to 4 months. The determination of early predictive criteria for the response to sorafenib would optimize the management of advanced HCCs. Indeed, sorafenib only improves overall survival by 3 months in selected patients, and with undesirable effects and a significant cost. Predictive biological criteria have already been studied, such as alpha foeto-protein (AFP), whose early decrease with sorafenib is associated with better overall survival. The same applies to the early reduction at 4-6 weeks of tumor arterial contrast according to mRECIST criteria. The perfusion scanner appears to be an accessible and reproducible choice imaging technique for assessing tumor vasculature. In metastatic kidney cancers, it was demonstrated that some criteria for tumor perfusion prior to treatment with sorafenib were predictive of better control of the disease and even a better tumor response according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. The determination of pre-therapeutic tumor perfusion criteria in order to predict tumor control or even overall survival has never been studied in advanced CHCs. On the other hand, an early variation in the criteria for tumor perfusion under treatment would tend to be correlated with the tumor response and even with overall progression-free survival.\n\nTherefore, the study of tumor vascularization by the perfusion scanner could make it possible to demonstrate early predictive criteria for tumor control under sorafenib in order to optimize the management of patients with advanced HCC.",

Conditions: Oligometastatic Gastric Adenocarcinoma. Interventions: FOLFOX and PIPAC (COMBINATION_PRODUCT). Sponsor: Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata Verona. Summary: Peritoneal Carcinomatosis is the most frequent site of metastases observed in patients with gastric cancer. Current standard treatment for these patients is palliative systemic chemotherapy, but the prognosis is very poor. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) resulted in long-term benefits in selected patients with limited peritoneal involvement. Indeed, among patients with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis, a distinctive subset is oligometastatic disease which is characterized by low metastatic burden. PIPAC is a recent technique of intraperitoneal chemotherapy that can be used in combination with systemic chemotherapy with promising results for patients with PM from gastric cancer. The role of PIPAC in multimodal treatment path for oligometastatic gastric cancer should be investigated in clinical trials. PIPAC VER-One is a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase III clinical trial with two arms that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of PIPAC in combination with systemic chemotherapy in patients with Gastric Cancer and synchronous positive peritoneal cytology and/or limited peritoneal metastases (PCI \u2264 6). Patients will be randomized into two arms: arm A (control) treated with the current standard that is systemic chemotherapy only and Arm B (experimental) treated with a bidirectional scheme including PIPAC and systemic chemotherapy (1 PIPAC every 2 systemic chemotherapy cycles). Primary endpoint is the Secondary Resectability Rate. Secondary endpoints are: Overall Survival, Progression Free Survival, Disease Free Survival, histological response assessed both on primary tumor and peritoneal lesions, Quality of Life, complication rate (CTCAE v5), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).",

Conditions: Breast Carcinoma. Interventions: Exemestane (DRUG). Sponsor: National University Hospital, Singapore. Summary: Aromatase inhibitors have led to significant improvements in clinical outcomes for women with postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer. However, there is a notable absence of phase III comparisons among the three agents and therefore no clear indication of the superiority of one AI over the others. Furthermore, there remains a distinct lack of predictive biomarkers of AI efficacy and toxicity to inform clinical decisions. The metabolic pathways of exemestane have recently been delineated and UGT2B17 is the most active hepatic gluconoryltransferase responsible for the glucuronidation of the crucial active exemestane metabolite, 17-dihydroxyexemestane. The UGT2B17\\*2/\\*2 deletion genotype is associated with markedly reduced glucuronidation of 17-dihydroxyexemestane in vitro and is found more commonly in Asians than Caucasians (60-70% vs less than 10%). Our research group recently demonstrated significant reduction in glucuronidation of vorinostat, a UGT2B17 substrate, with a trend towards improved clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in Asian breast cancer patients who were UGT2B17\\*2 homozygotes treated with this compound. In-vivo studies correlating UGT2B17\\*2 genotype with exemestane pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are lacking. We hypothesize that individuals with UGT2B17\\*2/\\*2 genotype have reduced glucuronidation of 17-dihydroxyexemestane and therefore have increased exposure to the active drug, resulting in improved treatment efficacy. We propose a study of exemestane in hormone receptor positive post-menopausal advanced breast cancer patients with prospective correlation of treatment outcome by UGT2B17 genotype. The primary endpoint is the correlation of genotype (UGT2B17\\*2/\\*2 vs those with at least one wild-type variant) with clinical benefit rate, and secondary endpoints include its association with exemestane pharmacokinetics, progression-free survival, overall survival and musculoskeletal toxicities.",

Interventions: ColoWrap (DEVICE). Sponsor: ColoWrap, LLC. Summary: Colonoscopy is the gold-standard for colorectal cancer screening in the US. However, complete colonoscopy can be a challenging technical procedure, even for expert gastroenterologists due to variations in patient anatomy, tortuous colons, and looping of the endoscope. Such obstacles can prolong colonoscopy, lead to complications, decrease polyp detection, and impact patient experience and tolerance. The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of a new non-invasive abdominal binder (ColoWrap\u00ae) in improving the performance and tolerance of colonoscopy by way of a randomized, blinded clinical trial. Eligible participants undergoing colonoscopy at University of North Carolina Hospitals (UNCH) will be recruited for the study and randomized to either the ColoWrap intervention or sham arm. Colonoscopy will be performed per usual operating procedures. The primary outcome will be time to distal extent (cecal intubation time). Secondary outcomes include colonoscopy completion rate, use of ancillary maneuvers, medication usage, procedural difficulty, patient comfort, and operator and assistant fatigue and pain. Efficacy will be assessed on the basis of pairwise comparisons between groups with respect to primary and secondary outcomes.",

Only patients who have cancers that can be seen when Tc99 P2045 is administered (also seeks out the SSTR2, but Tc99 images, but does not treat the cells) will be treated.\n\nTherefore, this approach maximizes the possibility that patients will benefit from treatment in that only those who have cancers that have the target will undergo treatment. The primary purpose of this study will be to determine the highest dose of Re188 P2045 that can be safely administered.\n\nThe second study will open after the conclusion of the first. Patients will first undergo the scan with Tc99 P2045 and then be treated with topotecan for three days. Topotecan is a standard chemotherapy drug that is approved for second line therapy for small cell and frequently used for other neuroendocrine cancers. Following that, patients will then be re-evaluated with the Tc99 P2045 scan and if it demonstrates that the tumor is positive for SSTR2, then patients will receive Re188 P2045. The goal of this study is to determine the highest dose of Re188 P2045 that can be safely administered after topotecan as well as to determine if topotecan will increase the chance that the tumor will express SSTR2.",

Sponsor: University Hospital, Angers. Summary: Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment approaches relie on risk stratification, including cytogenetics. We want to study at diagnosis several blast cells parameters on frozen samples of GRAALL protocols enrolled patients:\n\n1. A CD45-DNA double staining analysed by flow cytometry will allow mesurement for each blastic clone of DNA ploidy, percentage of cells in S-phase, CD45 fluorescence index.\n2. The proteine P16 metabolic way, involved in cell cycle regulation, will be studied by Western Blot analysis.\n\nThe comparison between these parameters, and main haematological data, will be followed by a prognostic analysis, based on blast corticosensibility in vivo, chimiosensibility, complete remission, and survival.\n\nCombination of the studied parameters will allow to appreciate a clonal diversity. This will help to predict, at diagnosis, high probability of resistance to treatment.",

Summary: RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine, dacarbazine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, procarbazine hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill cancer cells. Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells. Comparing results of imaging procedures, such as PET scans and CT scans, done before, during, and after chemotherapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase II clinical trial studies how well chemotherapy based on PET/CT scan works in treating patients with stage I or stage II Hodgkin lymphoma.",

Sponsor: University Hospital, Lille. Summary: Benign ovarian cysts are frequent during women's life. They are diagnosed with pelvic pain or fortuitously during an ultra-sonographic exam. In case of persistence,a surgery will be necessary to identify the nature of the cyst and assess its benignity. In some case, cysts are recurrent and multiple surgeries are needed leading to a significant risk of ovarian damage by follicular depletion. Oocyte cryopreservation is no longer considered as an experimental technique of Fertility Preservation since 2013 as it has been recognized to be efficient and safe. According to reproductive medicine scientific committees and the French ethic law, fertility preservation has to be proposed in every situation of infertility risk. To date, there is no cohort study dedicated to fertility preservation by oocyte freezing in this specific subgroup of patients. The purpose of the study is to prospectively evaluate the oocyte number and quality after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in patients with recurrent ovarian cysts.",
