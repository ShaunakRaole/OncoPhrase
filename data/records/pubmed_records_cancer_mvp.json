Abstract: Non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are largely classified into lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), which have different therapeutic options according to its molecular profiles and immune checkpoint expression, especially PD-L1, which is a suppressive factor in the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment can be altered by the genomic mutations on specific innate immune genes as well as tumor suppressor genes, so it is essential to comprehend the association between tumor microenvironment and tumor suppressor genes to discover the promising immunotherapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance of immune check point blockade. In this study, we aimed to analyze how the somatic mutations in tumor suppressor genes affect the tumor immune microenvironment through a comprehensive analysis of mutational profiling on the representative tumor suppressor genes (<i>TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, RB1, BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>) and immune gene expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 155 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and 196 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples. Several microenvironmental factors, such as the infiltrating immune and stromal cells, were suppressed by the mutated tumor suppressor genes in LUSC, unlike in the LUAD samples. In particular, infiltrating immune cells such as macrophage, neutrophil, and dendritic cells were significantly reduced in tumors with mutated tumor suppressor genes' group. In addition, the gene expressions for interleukin production and lymphocyte differentiation and <i>PGC, C7, HGF, PLA2G2A, IL1RL1, CCR2, ALOX15B, CXCL11, FCN3</i> were significantly down-regulated, which were key immune genes for the cross-talk between LUSC microenvironment and tumor suppressors. Therefore, we generated evidence that TSG mutations in LUSC have an impact on tumor immune microenvironment, which suggests that TSG non-mutated patients will have the more inflamed tumors and are more likely to respond to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

Abstract: Despite advancements in cancer therapy that have occurred over the past several decades, successful treatment of advanced malignancies remains elusive. Substantial resources and significant efforts have been directed toward the development of novel therapeutic modalities to improve patient outcomes. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are emerging tools with unique characteristics that have attracted great interest in developing effective anticancer treatment. The original attraction was directed toward selective replication and cell-specific toxicity, two unique features that are either inherent to the virus or could be conferred by genetic engineering. However, recent advancements in the knowledge and understanding of OVs are shifting the therapeutic paradigm toward a greater focus on their immunomodulatory role. Nonetheless, there are still significant obstacles that remain to be overcome to enhance the efficiency of OVs as effective therapeutic modalities and potentially establish them as part of standard treatment regimens. In this review, we discuss advances in the design of OVs, strategies to enhance their therapeutic efficacy, functional translation into the clinical settings, and various obstacles that are still encountered in the efforts to establish them as effective anticancer treatments.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cellular signaling perturbation by natural products.. Abstract: Cancer cells are known to have alterations in multiple cellular signaling pathways and because of the complexities in the communication between multiple signaling networks, the treatment and the cure for most human malignancies is still an open question. Perhaps, this is the reason why specific inhibitors that target only one pathway have been typically failed in cancer treatment. However, the in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that some natural products such as isoflavones, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), curcumin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), resveratrol, lycopene, etc, have inhibitory effects on human and animal cancers through targeting multiple cellular signaling pathways and thus these \"natural agents\" could be classified as multi-targeted agents. This is also consistent with the epidemiological studies showing that the consumption of fruits, soybean and vegetables is associated with reduced risk of several types of cancers. By regulating multiple important cellular signaling pathways including NF-kappaB, Akt, MAPK, Wnt, Notch, p53, AR, ER, etc, these natural products are known to activate cell death signals and induce apoptosis in pre-cancerous or cancer cells without affecting normal cells. Therefore, non-toxic \"natural agents\" harvested from the bounties of nature could be useful either alone or in combination with conventional therapeutics for the prevention of tumor progression and/or treatment of human malignancies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: An Integrated Clinical Genomic and Transcriptomic Subgrouping of Central Chondrosarcoma.. Abstract: Central conventional chondrosarcoma, a malignant cartilage-producing bone tumor, is the second most common bone sarcoma. Chondrosarcomas are histologically graded, which is so far the best predictor of survival. Early mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 genes are frequent, leading to the production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which affects DNA methylation, resulting in a preferred chondrogenic differentiation over osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, which are currently considered the precursor cells of chondrosarcoma. DNA methylation profiling has previously revealed distinct profiles between IDH-mutant and IDH-wild-type chondrosarcomas, but the presence of further DNA methylation subgroups indicates that classification based solely on IDH status is too simplistic. In this study, we aim to identify biological subgroups in a total of 116 chondrosarcomas by integrating clinical data, IDH mutation status, gene expression, and genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Clinical associations were observed between several factors, including sex and histological grade, as well as tumor site and IDH mutation status. RNA sequencing and genome-wide LOH confirmed the distinction between IDH-wild-type and IDH-mutant chondrosarcomas, where the number of chromosome arms affected by LOH was significantly higher in IDH-wild-type tumors than in IDH-mutant tumors. However, no clear subgroups emerged within each IDH group. Further clustering on RNA expression of differentiation markers identified subgroups characterized by chondrogenic, osteogenic, resting chondrocyte, or dedifferentiated profiles. These different subgroups showed a specific clinical presentation and suggest different precursor cells. Instead of a simple dichotomy between IDH-mutant and IDH-wild-type, our integrated approach highlights interconnected clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic patterns that offer a more nuanced view of chondrosarcoma biology and might potentially guide treatment stratification.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed mutation patterns of de-differentiated liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma.. Abstract: Treating patients with advanced sarcomas is challenging due to great histologic diversity among its subtypes. Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and de-differentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) are two common and aggressive subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (STS). They differ significantly in histology and clinical behaviors. However, the molecular driving force behind the difference is unclear. We collected 20 LMS and 12 DDLPS samples and performed whole exome sequencing (WES) to obtain their somatic mutation profiles. We also performed RNA-Seq to analyze the transcriptomes of 8 each of the LMS and DDLPS samples and obtained information about differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, immune cell infiltration in tumor microenvironment, and chromosomal rearrangement including gene fusions. Selected gene fusion events from the RNA-seq prediction were checked by RT-PCR in tandem with Sanger sequencing. We detected loss of function mutation and deletion of tumor suppressors mostly in LMS, and oncogene amplification mostly in DDLPS. A focal amplification affecting chromosome 12q13-15 region which encodes MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2 is notable in DDLPS. Mutations in TP53, ATRX, PTEN, and RB1 are identified in LMS but not DDLPS, while mutation of HERC2 is only identified in DDLPS but not LMS. RNA-seq revealed overexpression of MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2 in DDLPS and down-regulation of TP53 and RB1 in LMS. It also detected more fusion events in DDLPS than LMS (4.5 vs. 1, p\u2009=\u20090.0195), and the ones involving chromosome 12 in DDLPS stand out. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing verified the majority of the fusion events in DDLPS but only one event in LMS selected to be tested. The tumor microenvironmental signatures are highly correlated with histologic types. DDLPS has more endothelial cells and fibroblasts content than LMS. Our analysis revealed different recurrent genetic variations in LMS and DDLPS including simultaneous upregulation of gene expression and gene copy number amplification of MDM2 and CDK4. Up-regulation of tumor related genes is favored in DDLPS, while loss of suppressor function is favored in LMS. DDLPS harbors more frequent fusion events which can generate neoepitopes and potentially targeted by personalized immune treatment. Journal: BMC cancer. Year: 2020.

In this study, we aimed at dissecting the functional impact on transcriptome of gene mutations, copy-number abnormalities (CNA), and chromosomal rearrangements (CR). Moreover, we applied a geno-transcriptomic approach to identify specific biomarkers for personalized treatments. We analyzed 514 newly diagnosed patients from the IA12 release of the CoMMpass study, accounting for mutations in multiple myeloma driver genes, structural variants, copy-number segments, and raw-transcript counts. We performed an <i>in silico</i> drug sensitivity screen (DSS), interrogating the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) dataset after anchoring cell lines to primary tumor samples using the <i>Celligner</i> algorithm. Immunoglobulin translocations, hyperdiploidy and chr(1q)gain/amps were associated with the highest number of deregulated genes. Other CNAs and specific gene mutations had a lower but very distinct impact affecting specific pathways. Many recurrent genes showed a hotspot (HS)-specific effect. The clinical relevance of double-hit multiple myeloma found strong biological bases in our analysis. Biallelic deletions of tumor suppressors and chr(1q)-amplifications showed the greatest impact on gene expression, deregulating pathways related to cell cycle, proliferation, and expression of immunotherapy targets. Moreover, our <i>in silico</i> DSS showed that not only t(11;14) but also chr(1q)gain/amps and <i>CYLD</i> inactivation predicted differential expression of transcripts of the BCL2 axis and response to venetoclax. The multiple myeloma genomic architecture and transcriptome have a strict connection, led by CNAs and CRs. Gene mutations impacted especially with HS-mutations of oncogenes and biallelic tumor suppressor gene inactivation. Finally, a comprehensive geno-transcriptomic analysis allows the identification of specific deregulated pathways and candidate biomarkers for personalized treatments in multiple myeloma.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: CD133 expression in chemo-resistant Ewing sarcoma cells.. Abstract: Some human cancers demonstrate cellular hierarchies in which tumor-initiating cancer stem cells generate progeny cells with reduced tumorigenic potential. This cancer stem cell population is proposed to be a source of therapy-resistant and recurrent disease. Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) are highly aggressive cancers in which drug-resistant, relapsed disease remains a significant clinical problem. Recently, the cell surface protein CD133 was identified as a putative marker of tumor-initiating cells in ESFT. We evaluated ESFT tumors and cell lines to determine if high levels of CD133 are associated with drug resistance. Expression of the CD133-encoding PROM1 gene was determined by RT-PCR in ESFT tumors and cell lines. CD133 protein expression was assessed by western blot, FACS and/or immunostaining. Cell lines were FACS-sorted into CD133+ and CD133- fractions and proliferation, colony formation in soft agar, and in vivo tumorigenicity compared. Chemosensitivity was measured using MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxy-methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assays. PROM1 expression was either absent or extremely low in most tumors. However, PROM1 was highly over-expressed in 4 of 48 cases. Two of the 4 patients with PROM1 over-expressing tumors rapidly succumbed to primary drug-resistant disease and two are long-term, event-free survivors. The expression of PROM1 in ESFT cell lines was similarly heterogeneous. The frequency of CD133+ cells ranged from 2-99% and, with one exception, no differences in the chemoresistance or tumorigenicity of CD133+ and CD133- cell fractions were detected. Importantly, however, the STA-ET-8.2 cell line was found to retain a cellular hierarchy in which relatively chemo-resistant, tumorigenic CD133+ cells gave rise to relatively chemo-sensitive, less tumorigenic, CD133- progeny. Up to 10% of ESFT express high levels of PROM1. In some tumors and cell lines the CD133+ fraction is relatively more drug-resistant, while in others there is no apparent difference between CD133+ and CD133- cells. These studies reveal heterogeneity in PROM1/CD133 expression in ESFT tumors and cell lines and confirm that high levels of PROM1 expression are, in at least some cases, associated with chemo-resistant disease. Further studies are required to elucidate the contribution of PROM1/CD133 expressing cells to therapeutic resistance in a large, prospective cohort of primary ESFT. Journal: BMC cancer. Year: 2010.

Abstract: TGF\u03b2 is a pleiotropic signaling pathway that plays a pivotal role in regulating a multitude of cellular functions. TGF\u03b2 has a dual role in cell regulation where it induces growth inhibition and cell death; however, it can switch to a growth-promoting state under cancerous conditions. TGF\u03b2 is upregulated in colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer, altering the tumor microenvironment and immune system and promoting a mesenchymal state. The upregulation of TGF\u03b2 in certain cancers leads to resistance to immunotherapy, and attempts to inhibit TGF\u03b2 expression have led to reduced therapeutic resistance when combined with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Here, we review the current TGF\u03b2 inhibitor drugs in clinical trials for pancreatic and colorectal cancer, with the goal of uncovering advances in improving clinical efficacy for TGF\u03b2 combinational treatments in patients. Furthermore, we discuss the relevance of alterations in TGF\u03b2 signaling and germline variants in the context of personalizing treatment for patients who show lack of response to current therapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular characteristics of biliary tract cancer.. Abstract: Biliary tract cancers (intrahepatic, perihilar and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder and cystic duct cancers) are uncommon but highly lethal malignancies. Clinical presentation is often late, precluding curative surgical resection in most cases. For advanced disease, therapeutic options are limited to systemic chemotherapy, with suboptimal outcomes. An understanding of the molecular characteristics of biliary tract cancers may allow the clinical development of therapies targeting actionable alterations with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes. We present a comprehensive review of biliary tract cancer genomics and their clinical implications. Alterations in genes in the EGFR-MAPK-PI3K pathway are seen most often. KRAS alterations are highly prevalent; BRAF alterations are mutually exclusive from RAS alterations and much less frequent. PIK3CA alterations are seen mostly in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancers whereas HER2 amplification is most common in gallbladder cancers. Various tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53 and p16 are also altered often in biliary tract cancers; however, agents to \"activate\" silenced genes are currently lacking. FGF and IDH pathway alterations are potential targets for therapeutic agents. FGF alterations are typically fusions with other genes, resulting in altered proteins, and are seen most often in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. IDH pathway alterations affect cellular enzymatic processes and are most common in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Ongoing clinical trials of agents targeting these pathways hold the promise of improving clinical outcomes. Journal: Critical reviews in oncology/hematology. Year: 2016.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The Crosstalk between FAK and Wnt Signaling Pathways in Cancer and Its Therapeutic Implication.. Abstract: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Wnt signaling pathways are important contributors to tumorigenesis in several cancers. While most results come from studies investigating these pathways individually, there is increasing evidence of a functional crosstalk between both signaling pathways during development and tumor progression. A number of FAK-Wnt interactions are described, suggesting an intricate, context-specific, and cell type-dependent relationship. During development for instance, FAK acts mainly upstream of Wnt signaling; and although in intestinal homeostasis and mucosal regeneration Wnt seems to function upstream of FAK signaling, FAK activates the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway during APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis. In breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers, FAK is reported to modulate the Wnt signaling pathway, while in prostate cancer, FAK is downstream of Wnt. In malignant mesothelioma, FAK and Wnt show an antagonistic relationship: Inhibiting FAK signaling activates the Wnt pathway and vice versa. As the identification of effective Wnt inhibitors to translate in the clinical setting remains an outstanding challenge, further understanding of the functional interaction between Wnt and FAK could reveal new therapeutic opportunities and approaches greatly needed in clinical oncology. In this review, we summarize some of the most relevant interactions between FAK and Wnt in different cancers, address the current landscape of Wnt- and FAK-targeted therapies in different clinical trials, and discuss the rationale for targeting the FAK-Wnt crosstalk, along with the possible translational implications.

    "name": "YAP and WWTR1: New targets for skin cancer treatment.",
    "search_text": "PubMed paper: YAP and WWTR1: New targets for skin cancer treatment.. Abstract: The core components of the Hippo signaling pathway are a cascade of kinases that govern the phosphorylation of downstream transcriptional co-activators, namely, YES-associated protein (YAP) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (WWTR1, also known as TAZ). The Hippo signaling pathway is considered an important tumor-suppressor pathway, and its dysregulation has been noted in a variety of human cancers, in which YAP/WWTR1 enable cancerous cells to overcome contact inhibition, and to grow and spread uncontrollably. Interestingly, however, recent studies have told a somewhat different but perhaps more intriguing YAP/WWTR1 story, as these studies found that YAP/WWTR1 function as a central hub that integrates signals from multiple upstream signaling pathways, cell-cell interactions and mechanical forces and then bind to and activate different downstream transcriptional factors to direct cell social behavior and cell-cell interactions. In this review, we present the latest findings on the role of YAP/WWTR1 in skin physiology, pathology and tumorigenesis and discuss the statuses of newly developed therapeutic interventions that target YAP/WWTR1 in human cancers, as well as their prospects for use as skin cancer treatments.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Lymphatic relapse in women with early breast cancer: a difficult management problem.. Abstract: The aim of this study was to review the ability to control symptoms of regional lymphatic relapse in women with early breast cancer. A retrospective study was made of 759 consecutive women presenting with stage 1 or 2 breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy between June 1984 and December 1994, 291 (38.3%) of whom were managed by a policy of observation on the lymphatic pathways. Patterns of lymphatic relapse, relapse management and morbidity caused by recurrent malignancy were reviewed from the case notes. The overall rate of relapse in the ipsilateral axilla and/or supraclavicular fossa was 76/759 (10%) at any time prior to death or last follow-up. 34 of 65 patients who relapsed in the axilla did so despite prior axillary surgery and/or radiotherapy. 41 of 76 patients with regional recurrence presented with symptoms, including lymphoedema, arm pain or sensory motor changes. These symptoms were poorly controlled by palliative surgery, radiotherapy or systemic therapy in 23 cases, including 12 who progressed to arm paralysis. Symptomatic control of patients with regional lymphatic relapse can be very difficult, even in women under regular surveillance in a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic.

Abstract: There is a paucity of data on the treatment outcome in children with relapsed or poorly responsive nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (nLPHL). This retrospective report evaluates the treatment outcome in a national cohort of children with relapsed or poorly responsive nLPHL. A total of 37 patients, 22 with relapsed and 15 with poorly responding disease, are the subjects of this report. Of the 22 patients with relapsed nLPHL, 11 had relapsed after primary excision biopsy, 10 after chemotherapy and 1 after chemotherapy and involved field radiotherapy. The majority had localized disease at relapse. The median time to relapse was 8\u00a0months after chemotherapy and 11\u00a0months after excision biopsy. Seven of the 15 patients with poorly responding nLPHL had variant histology. Three patients with initial poor response did not receive any further treatment and have had no disease progression. Transformation to diffuse large B cell lymphoma, in addition to evolution from typical to variant nLPHL occurred in one patient each. Thirty-four patients have been successfully re-treated with second chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Multiple relapses were uncommon but treatable. Relapse or poorly responsive nLPHL is fully salvageable with either additional chemotherapy and or radiotherapy. Journal: British journal of haematology. Year: 2016.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Treatment of Relapse of Clinical Stage I Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumors on Surveillance.. Abstract: Active surveillance (AS) for testicular nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) is widely used. Although there is no consensus for optimal treatment at relapse on surveillance, globally patients typically receive chemotherapy. We describe treatment of relapses in our non-risk-adapted NSGCT AS cohort and highlight selective use of primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). From December 1980 to December 2015, 580 patients with clinical stage I NSGCT were treated with AS, and 162 subsequently relapsed. First-line treatment was based on relapse site and extent. Logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with need for multimodal therapy on AS relapse. Median time to relapse was 7.4 months. The majority of relapses were confined to the retroperitoneum (66%). After relapse, first-line treatment was chemotherapy for 95 (58.6%) and RPLND for 62 (38.3%), and five patients (3.1%) underwent other therapy. In 103 (65.6%), only one modality of treatment was required: chemotherapy only in 58 of 95 (61%) and RPLND only in 45 of 62 (73%). Factors associated with multimodal relapse therapy were larger node size (odds ratio, 2.68; <i>P</i> = .045) in patients undergoing chemotherapy and elevated tumor markers (odds ratio, 6.05; <i>P</i> = .008) in patients undergoing RPLND. When RPLND was performed with normal markers, 82% required no further treatment. Second relapse occurred in 30 of 162 patients (18.5%). With median follow-up of 7.6 years, there were five deaths (3.1% of AS relapses, but 0.8% of whole AS cohort) from NSGCT or treatment complications. The retroperitoneum is the most common site of relapse in clinical stage I NSGCT on AS. Most are cured by single-modality treatment. RPLND should be considered for relapsed patients, especially those with disease limited to the retroperitoneum and normal markers, as an option to avoid chemotherapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Mutational dynamics of early and late relapsed childhood ALL: rapid clonal expansion and long-term dormancy.. Abstract: Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) is the most frequent pediatric cancer. Refractory/relapsed cALL presents a survival rate of \u223c45% and is still one of the leading causes of death by disease among children. Mechanisms, such as clonal competition and evolutionary adaptation, govern treatment resistance. However, the underlying clonal dynamics leading to multiple relapses and differentiating early (<36 months postdiagnosis) from late relapse events remain elusive. Here, we use an integrative genome-based analysis combined with serial sampling of relapsed tumors (from primary tumor to \u22644 relapse events) from 19 pre-B-cell cALL patients (8 early and 11 late relapses) to assess the fitness of somatic mutations and infer their ancestral relationships. By quantifying both general clonal dynamics and newly acquired subclonal diversity, we show that 2 distinct evolutionary patterns govern early and late relapse: on one hand, a highly dynamic pattern, sustained by a putative defect of DNA repair processes, illustrating the quick emergence of fitter clones, and on the other hand, a quasi-inert evolution pattern, suggesting the escape from dormancy of leukemia stem cells likely spared from initial cytoreductive therapy. These results offer new insights into cALL relapse mechanisms and highlight the pressing need for adapted treatment strategies to circumvent resistance mechanisms. Journal: Blood advances.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The rise of new targets in melanoma.. Abstract: Despite advancements in cancer treatment, the clinical options remain limited and therapeutic resistance inevitably develops. In melanoma, the second most commonly mutated driver oncogene is NRAS, which remains undruggable by small molecular agents. For those treated with BRAF/MEK combination therapy, in the setting of BRAF V600 mutations, or immunotherapies regardless of somatic genetic makeup, resistance eventually develops in the majority of cases. Developing rational combination therapies, as suggested by preclinical studies involving genetic manipulation of resistance mediators, necessitates a substantial expansion of druggable targets. Novel chemistry strategies, such as chemoproteomics platforms and chemical inducer of proximity (CIP) agents, offer promising solutions. Chemoproteomics enables the rapid identification of ligands to guide medicinal chemistry, while CIP agents alter the expression levels of key proteins. Using proteins encoded by oncogenes (such as NRAS) and p53 as pivotal resistance mediators, and the lineage-specific transcription factor SRY-box transcription factor 10 (SOX10) in melanoma as illustrative examples, we demonstrate how these technologies can be leveraged to rapidly expand the druggable target pool and overcome resistance mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for regimens that produce deeper and more durable responses.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Concepts for Immunotherapies in Gliomas.. Abstract: Strategies to empower the immune system to successfully attack cancers, including vaccination approaches, adaptive T cell therapies, and immune checkpoint modulators, have recently achieved remarkable success across a spectrum of cancer indications. Nonetheless, with rare exception, only a minority of patients with a given type of cancer respond to an immunotherapeutic when administered as single-agent therapy. Although under extensive laboratory and clinical investigation, the role of these approaches for glioma patients remains to be determined. While the central nervous system (CNS) is no longer regarded as an immunoprivileged sanctuary, nuances regarding immune responses in the CNS may impact on the activity of immunotherapy treatments of brain tumor patients. Furthermore, many common CNS tumors such as World Health Organization grade III and IV (high grade) gliomas utilize myriad, nonoverlapping strategies to dampen or extinguish antitumor immune responses. For these reasons, critical research efforts are focused on identifying biomarkers that predict patients with a heightened likelihood of therapeutic benefit as well as evaluating rationally designed combinatorial immunotherapy approaches with potentially complementary mechanisms of immune-activation for brain cancer patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Patterns of relapse and response to retreatment in patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma who responded to interleukin-2-based immunotherapy.. Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the pattern of relapse and the treatment of relapse with either surgery or repeat immunotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma who had previously responded to interleukin-2-based therapy. Over a 10-year period 1051 patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma were treated with interleukin-2-based immunotherapy at a single institution. One hundred fifty-nine patients who relapsed after an initial partial response or complete response to interleukin-2-based immunotherapy formed the study population for this retrospective review. Medical records, physical examination forms, and relevant radiographs were reviewed to determine response, relapse site(s), and response to treatment for relapse. Relapse after an initial response to interleukin-2-based therapy occurred in 84 (80%) of 105 patients with metastatic melanoma and in 75 (70%) of 107 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Relapse after an initial partial response involved 71 (97%) of 73 patients with metastatic melanoma and 55 (86%) of 64 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The initial site(s) of relapse after a partial response involved a new site(s), old site(s), or both old and new sites with relatively even distribution. Relapse after an initial complete response occurred in 13 (41%) of 32 patients with metastatic melanoma and in 20 (47%) of 43 completely responding patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Surprisingly, the initial site of relapse after a complete response involved only new sites of disease in 70% of patients. Retreatment of relapses with the same interleukin-2-based therapy originally used was effective in only one (2%) of 54 selected patients, but a different interleukin-2-based therapy in 35 patients resulted in five responders (a 14% secondary response rate). Most re-responders, however, responded to treatment with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interleukin-2, and only one of 20 patients responded to retreatment with interleukin-2 alone. Surgical metastasectomy with therapeutic intent in 25 selected melanoma patients and in 31 selected renal cell cancer patients resulted in a 2-year progression-free survival of 18% in patients with metastatic melanoma and 37% in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma, tumor relapse was common after a partial response to an interleukin-2-based therapy and included previously identified sites of disease in most patients. Relapse after a complete response was less frequent and involved only new sites in a majority of patients. In selected patients who relapsed, repeat treatment with the same interleukin-2-based therapy that provided the initial response was rarely effective. However, with a different interleukin-2-based therapy, usually using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, repeat treatment induced secondary responses in some patients. In addition, salvage metastasectomy resulted in durable progression-free survival in selected patients. Journal: The cancer journal from Scientific American. Year: 1998.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Structural and logical analysis of a comprehensive hedgehog signaling pathway to identify alternative drug targets for glioma, colon and pancreatic cancer.. Abstract: Hedgehog is an evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway, widely implicated in controlling various cellular responses such as cellular proliferation and stem cell renewal in human and other organisms, through external stimuli. Aberrant activation of this pathway in human adult stem cell line may cause different types of cancers. Hence, targeting this pathway in cancer therapy has become indispensable, but the non availability of detailed molecular interactions, complex regulations by extra- and intra-cellular proteins and cross talks with other pathways pose a serious challenge to get a coherent understanding of this signaling pathway for making therapeutic strategy. This motivated us to perform a computational study of the pathway and to identify probable drug targets. In this work, from available databases and literature, we reconstructed a complete hedgehog pathway which reports the largest number of molecules and interactions to date. Using recently developed computational techniques, we further performed structural and logical analysis of this pathway. In structural analysis, the connectivity and centrality parameters were calculated to identify the important proteins from the network. To capture the regulations of the molecules, we developed a master Boolean model of all the interactions between the proteins and created different cancer scenarios, such as Glioma, Colon and Pancreatic. We performed perturbation analysis on these cancer conditions to identify the important and minimal combinations of proteins that can be used as drug targets. From our study we observed the under expressions of various oncoproteins in Hedgehog pathway while perturbing at a time the combinations of the proteins GLI1, GLI2 and SMO in Glioma; SMO, HFU, ULK3 and RAS in Colon cancer; SMO, HFU, ULK3, RAS and ERK12 in Pancreatic cancer. This reconstructed Hedgehog signaling pathway and the computational analysis for identifying new combinatory drug targets will be useful for future in-vitro and in-vivo analysis to control different cancers.

We performed whole-exome and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing on multi-regional tumors, normal tissues and blood samples from 39 ESCC patients. The data revealed 12.8% of ERBB4 mutations at patient level and functional study supported its oncogenic role. 18% of\u00a0patients with early BRCA1/2 variants were associated with high-level contribution of signature 3, which was validated in an independent large cohort (n\u2009=\u2009508). Furthermore, knockdown of BRCA1/2 dramatically increased sensitivity to cisplatin in ESCC cells. 5% of\u00a0patients harbored focal high-level amplification of CD274 that led to massive expression of PD-L1, and might be more sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade. Finally, we found a\u00a0tight correlation between genomic and TCR repertoire intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH). Collectively, we reveal high-level ITH in ESCC, identify several potential actionable targets and may provide novel insight into ESCC treatment. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2019.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Multiomics profiling of the expression and prognosis of MCMs in endometrial carcinoma.. Abstract: Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) family members are a group of genes involved in regulating DNA replication and cell division and have been identified as oncogenes in various cancer types. Several experimental studies have suggested that MCMs are dysregulated in endometrial carcinoma (EC). However, the expression pattern, clinical value and functions of different MCMs have yet to be analyzed systematically and comprehensively. We analyzed expression, survival rate, DNA alteration, PPT network, GGI network, functional enrichment cancer hallmarks and drug sensitivity of MCMs in patients with EC based on diverse datasets, including Oncomine, GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, HPA, Sangerbox and GSCALite databases. The results indicated that most MCM members were increased in EC and showed a prognostic value in survival analysis, which were considerately well in terms of PFS and OS prognostic prediction. Importantly, functional enrichment, PPI network and GGI network suggested that MCMs interact with proteins related to DNA replication and cell division, which may be the mechanism of MCM promote EC progression. Further data mining illustrated that MCMs have broad DNA hypomethylation levels and high levels of copy number aberrations in tumor tissue samples, which may be the mechanism causing the high expression level of MCMs. Moreover, MCM2 can activate or suppress diverse cancer-related pathways and is implicated in EC drug sensitivity. Taking together, our findings illustrate the expression pattern, clinical value and function of MCMs in EC and imply that MCMs are potential targets for precision therapy and new biomarkers for the prognosis of patients with EC.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Hereditary breast cancer: pathobiology, clinical translation, and potential for targeted cancer therapeutics.. Abstract: BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancers have distinct biological features as evidenced by histopathologic, immunohistochemical, gene expression profiling, and array-comparative genomic hybridization data. BRCA1 breast cancers may have a worse prognosis but may, however be amenable to treatment such as chemotherapy for small high-grade, lymph node negative breast cancers. Paradoxically, tamoxifen may provide effective adjuvant and chemopreventive therapy despite the predominantly negative estrogen receptor status of BRCA1 breast cancers. The distinctive biology of BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancers bodes well for the development of targeted cancer therapies. Cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 loss of function are deficient in DNA double strand break repair and are sensitized to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, causing the persistence of DNA lesions which are usually repaired by homologous recombination and ultimately leading to apoptosis. The potentially high efficacy and low toxicity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors presents an opportunity for targeted cancer therapeutics for BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation carriers. Genotype-tailored chemoprevention may be feasible which could theoretically eliminate single cells that have sustained a second hit, before cancer progression takes place. If targeted cancer therapies emerge, it will become crucially important to identify BRCA carriers at the time of diagnosis for optimal therapy and to identify unaffected carriers for chemoprevention.

Abstract: Conclusion This study indicates that IL-10 promoter polymorphism variants, smoking, and alcohol consumption increase the risk of recurrence and canceration in vocal leukoplakia. Objective This prospective, clinical trial was performed to evaluate the association of interleukin (IL)-10 promoter polymorphism variants and canceration and recurrence rates in vocal leukoplakia (a pre-cancerous laryngeal carcinoma lesion) over a 2-year period. Participants and method Sixty-one post-operative patients with vocal leukoplakia were enrolled in this prospective, observational study and genotyped for the IL-10 promoter gene (IL-10-1082 A/G, -819 T/C and -592 A/C) using pyrosequencing, and responded to a 2-year follow-up survey. Recurrence and canceration rates were used to evaluate the association between the genotype variants and the clinical outcome. Results There was an increased canceration rate in the variant genotype group compared to that in the normal genotype group in the 2-year follow-up period (18.4% vs 0%, p-value\u2009=\u20090.038). Compared with the non-smoker group, the smoker group had a higher recurrence rate of vocal leukoplakia (29.3% vs 5%, p-value =0.044). Likewise, the recurrence rate in the alcohol consumption group was also higher (30.6% vs 8%, p-value =0.034). The percentage of cancerization in the alcohol consumption group was significantly higher than that in the non-alcohol consumption group (19.4% vs 0%, p-value =0.035).

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Recent Advances and Prospects of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics for Anti-Cancer Therapy.. Abstract: Nucleic acid therapeutics are promising alternatives to conventional anti-cancer therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. While conventional therapies have limitations, such as high side effects, low specificity, and drug resistance, nucleic acid therapeutics work at the gene level to eliminate the cause of the disease. Nucleic acid therapeutics treat diseases in various forms and using different mechanisms, including plasmid DNA (pDNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), anti-microRNA (anti-miR), microRNA mimics (miRNA mimic), messenger RNA (mRNA), aptamer, catalytic nucleic acid (CNA), and CRISPR cas9 guide RNA (gRNA). In addition, nucleic acids have many advantages as nanomaterials, such as high biocompatibility, design flexibility, low immunogenicity, small size, relatively low price, and easy functionalization. Nucleic acid therapeutics can have a high therapeutic effect by being used in combination with various nucleic acid nanostructures, inorganic nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), etc. to overcome low physiological stability and cell internalization efficiency. The field of nucleic acid therapeutics has advanced remarkably in recent decades, and as more and more nucleic acid therapeutics have been approved, they have already demonstrated their potential to treat diseases, including cancer. This review paper introduces the current status and recent advances in nucleic acid therapy for anti-cancer treatment and discusses the tasks and prospects ahead.

Abstract: Omics techniques generate comprehensive profiles of biomolecules in cells and tissues. However, a holistic understanding of underlying systems requires joint analyses of multiple data modalities. We present DPM, a data fusion method for integrating omics datasets using directionality and significance estimates of genes, transcripts, or proteins. DPM allows users to define how the input datasets are expected to interact directionally given the experimental design or biological relationships between the datasets. DPM prioritises genes and pathways that change consistently across the datasets and penalises those with inconsistent directionality. To demonstrate our approach, we characterise gene and pathway regulation in IDH-mutant gliomas by jointly analysing transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation datasets. Directional integration of survival information in ovarian cancer reveals candidate biomarkers with consistent prognostic signals in transcript and protein expression. DPM is a general and adaptable framework for gene prioritisation and pathway analysis in multi-omics datasets. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: cGAS/STING signaling pathway in gynecological malignancies: From molecular mechanisms to therapeutic values.. Abstract: Gynecological cancers, including cervical, ovarian, and endometrial malignancies, remain a significant global health burden, exacerbated by disparities in access to preventive measures such as HPV vaccination and routine screening. The cGAS/STING signaling pathway, a pivotal mechanism in innate immunity, detects cytosolic DNA from pathogens or cellular damage, triggering immune responses via type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines. This pathway's dual role in gynecological cancers, either promoting antitumor immunity or facilitating tumor immune evasion, makes it a compelling target for innovative therapies. The article outlines cGAS/STING's influence on tumor microenvironments, immune surveillance, and inflammation, with emphasis on molecular mechanisms driving cancer progression. It explores interactions between DNA damage response pathways and immune modulation, highlighting the impact of cGAS/STING activation or suppression in ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers. The therapeutic potential of STING agonists, PARP inhibitors, and targeted immunotherapies is reviewed, demonstrating how these approaches can boost immune responses, counteract chemotherapy resistance, and improve patient outcomes. The study also discusses strategies for leveraging cGAS/STING signaling to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies and address tumor-mediated immune suppression, providing insights into future directions for personalized cancer treatments.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: CK2B is a Prognostic Biomarker and a Potential Drug Target for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.. Abstract: Although casein kinase II subunit beta (CK2B) was previously reported to be involved in human cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), there has been no systematic assessment of CK2B in HCC. To assess the potential function of CK2B as a prognostic biomarker and possible druggable target in HCC. The Cancer Genome Atlas database was accessed to investigate the potential oncogenic and prognostic roles of CK2B in HCC. Diverse analytical methods were used to obtain a fuller understanding of CK2B, including CIBERSORT, The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and gene ontology (GO). Furthermore, the Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD) was used to identify potential drugs to treat <sub>CK2B</sub>-overexpressing HCC. Patents for these drugs were reviewed using Patentscope<sup>\u00ae</sup> and Worldwide Espacenet<sup>\u00ae</sup>. Upregulated CK2B expression was markedly associated with more aggressive pathological features, including G3, G4 (vs. G1, G2), and T2, T3 (vs. T1). Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that patients with HCC with higher expression of CK2B had worse overall survival (P = 0.005), progression-free interval (P = 0.001), and disease-specific survival (P = 0.011). GO and KEGG analysis revealed that CK2B dysregulation affects mitotic chromosome condensation, protein stabilization and binding, regulation of signal transduction of p53 class mediator, and cancer-related pathways. GSEA identified six well-known pathways, including MAPK, WNT, Hedgehog, and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways. Finally, CTD identified six compounds that might represent targeted drugs to treat HCC with <sub>CK2B</sub> overexpression. A review of patents indicated these compounds showed promising anticancer results; however, whether CK2B interacts with these drugs and improves drug outcomes for patients with HCC was not confirmed. CK2B is a biomarker for HCC prognosis and could be a potential new drug target. Moreover, the association between infiltrating immune cells and CK2B in the HCC tumor microenvironment might provide a solid basis for further investigation and a potent strategy for immunotherapy of HCC.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Advances in antibody therapeutics targeting small-cell lung cancer.. Abstract: The proportion of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) among all lung cancers decreased from 17.26% in 1986 to 12.95% in 2002. Chemotherapy is the key mode of treatment. However, novel therapeutic strategies and drugs are imperative, as the prognosis remains poor. In recent years, antibody therapies have shown promising prospects against malignancy. This review focuses on the advances in antibody therapies in SCLC. Although the results of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, and rovalpituzumab tesirine are inspiring, all of the clinical trials on these drugs are phase I/II and have been verified for further phase III clinical trials. It was demonstrated that chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab can improve the progression-free survival (PFS) in phase III trials. The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is associated with a poor prognosis in SCLC, while the anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody figitumumab has a potential therapeutic value. Tarextumab, an antibody that blocks both Notch2 and Notch3 signaling, in combination with etoposide and platinum (EP) in patients with untreated extensive-stage SCLC, proved to be well-tolerated and showed dosedependent anti-tumor activity. The therapeutic effect of sacituzumab govitecan, BW-2 and lorvotuzumab mertansine in SCLC warranted further evaluation. Bec2/BCG as an adjuvant vaccination in patients with limited-disease SCLC could not improve the survival, PFS, or quality of life. Thus, clinical studies are essential to confirm the anti-tumor efficacy of trastuzumab in SCLC. Journal: Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University.

Abstract: The improvement in outcomes for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the greatest success stories of modern oncology however the prognosis for patients who relapse remains dismal. Recent discoveries by high resolution genomic technologies have characterized the biology of relapsed leukemia, most notably pathways leading to the drug resistant phenotype. These observations open the possibility of targeting such pathways to prevent and/or treat relapse. Likewise, early experiences with new immunotherapeutic approaches have shown great promise. Areas covered: We performed a literature search on PubMed and recent meeting abstracts using the keywords below. We focused on the biology and clonal evolution of relapsed disease highlighting potential new targets of therapy. We further summarized the results of early trials of the three most prominent immunotherapy agents currently under investigation. Expert commentary: Discovery of targetable pathways that lead to drug resistance and recent breakthroughs in immunotherapy show great promise towards treating this aggressive disease. The best way to treat relapse, however, is to prevent it which makes incorporation of these new approaches into frontline therapy the best approach. Challenges remain to balance efficacy with toxicity and to prevent the emergence of resistant subclones which is why combining these newer agents with conventional chemotherapy will likely become standard of care.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: High throughput profiling of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas identifies two main subgroups with distinct immune profile, clinical outcome and sensitivity to targeted therapies.. Abstract: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) is the most frequent, aggressive and less-characterized sarcoma subtype. This study aims to assess UPS molecular characteristics and identify specific therapeutic targets. High-throughput technologies encompassing immunohistochemistry, RNA-sequencing, whole exome-sequencing, mass spectrometry, as well as radiomics were used to characterize three independent cohorts of 110, 25 and 41 UPS selected after histological review performed by an expert pathologist. Correlations were made with clinical outcome. Cell lines and xenografts were derived from human samples for functional experiments. CD8 positive cell density was independently associated with metastatic behavior and prognosis. RNA-sequencing identified two main groups: the group A, enriched in genes involved in development and stemness, including FGFR2, and the group B, strongly enriched in genes involved in immunity. Immune infiltrate patterns on tumor samples were highly predictive of gene expression classification, leading to call the group B 'immune-high' and the group A 'immune-low'. This molecular classification and its prognostic impact were confirmed on an independent cohort of UPS from TCGA. Copy numbers alterations were significantly more frequent in immune-low UPS. Proteomic analysis identified two main proteomic groups that highly correlated with the two main transcriptomic groups. A set of nine radiomic features from conventional MRI sequences provided the basis for a radiomics signature that could select immune-high UPS on their pre-therapeutic imaging. Finally, in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity of FGFR inhibitor JNJ-42756493 was selectively shown in cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models derived from immune-low UPS. Two main disease entities of UPS, with distinct immune phenotypes, prognosis, molecular features and MRI textures, as well as differential sensitivity to specific anticancer agents were identified. Immune-high UPS may be the best candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitors, whereas this study provides rational for assessing FGFR inhibition in immune-low UPS.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is the 10th most common cancer worldwide. Due to the lack of understanding of the oncogenic mechanisms between muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and advanced bladder cancer (ABC) and the limitations of current treatments, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. In this study, we utilized the systems biology method via genome-wide microarray data to explore the oncogenic mechanisms of MIBC and ABC to identify their respective drug targets for systems drug discovery. First, we constructed the candidate genome-wide genetic and epigenetic networks (GWGEN) through big data mining. Second, we applied the system identification and system order detection method to delete false positives in candidate GWGENs to obtain the real GWGENs of MIBC and ABC from their genome-wide microarray data. Third, we extracted the core GWGENs from the real GWGENs by selecting the significant proteins, genes and epigenetics via the principal network projection (PNP) method. Finally, we obtained the core signaling pathways from the corresponding core GWGEN through the annotations of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway to investigate the carcinogenic mechanisms of MIBC and ABC. Based on the carcinogenic mechanisms, we selected the significant drug targets NFKB1, LEF1 and MYC for MIBC, and LEF1, MYC, NOTCH1 and FOXO1 for ABC. To design molecular drug combinations for MIBC and ABC, we employed a deep neural network (DNN)-based drug-target interaction (DTI) model with drug specifications. The DNN-based DTI model was trained by drug-target interaction databases to predict the candidate drugs for MIBC and ABC, respectively. Subsequently, the drug design specifications based on regulation ability, sensitivity and toxicity were employed as filter criteria for screening the potential drug combinations of Embelin and Obatoclax for MIBC, and Obatoclax, Entinostat and Imiquimod for ABC from their candidate drugs. In conclusion, we not only investigated the oncogenic mechanisms of MIBC and ABC, but also provided promising therapeutic options for MIBC and ABC, respectively.

Abstract: A growing body of evidence suggests that tumor-derived fragmentary DNA, known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), has the potential to serve as a non-invasive biomarker for disease monitoring. However, in the setting of hematological malignancy, few published studies support the utility of ctDNA. We retrospectively investigated ctDNA levels of 17 patients with various hematological malignancies who had achieved remission after first-line therapy. We identified somatic driver mutations by next-generation sequencing, and designed droplet digital PCR assays for each mutation to measure ctDNA. Variant allele frequencies of ctDNA changed in association with clinical response in all patients. Eight patients clinically relapsed after a median of 297 days post-first-line therapy (termed, \"relapsed group\"); the remaining nine patients remained disease-free for a median of 332 days (termed, \"remission group\"). Among patients in the relapsed group, ctDNA levels increased more than twofold at paired serial time points. In marked contrast, ctDNA levels of all patients in the remission group remained undetectable or stable during clinical remission. Notably, ctDNA-based molecular relapse demonstrated a median 30-day lead time over clinical relapse. In summary, ctDNA monitoring may help identify hematologic cancer patients at risk for relapse in advance of established clinical parameters. Journal: International journal of hematology. Year: 2018.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: A comprehensive catalogue of functional genetic variations in the EGFR pathway: protein-protein interaction analysis reveals novel genes and polymorphisms important for cancer research.. Abstract: The EGFR pathway is a critical signaling pathway deregulated in many solid tumors. In addition to the initiation and progression of cancer, the EGFR pathway is also implicated in variable treatment responses and prognoses. Genetic variation in the form of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect the function/expression of the EGFR pathway genes. Here, we applied a systematic and comprehensive approach utilizing diverse public databases and in silico analysis tools to select putative functional genetic variations from 244 genes involved in the EGFR pathway. Our data comprises 649 SNPs. Three hundred sixty SNPs are predicted to have biological consequences (functional SNPs). These SNPs can be directly used in further studies to test their association with risk, treatment response and prognosis in cancer. To systematically cover the EGFR pathway, we also performed a network-based analysis to further select putative functional SNPs from the genes whose protein products physically interact with the EGFR pathway proteins. We utilized protein-protein interaction information and focused on 14 proteins that have a high degree of connectivity (interacting with > or = 10 proteins) with the EGFR pathway genes identified to have functional SNPs (f-EGFR genes). Two of these proteins (FYN and LCK) had interactions with 17 of the f-EGFR genes, yet both lacked any putative functional SNP. However, our analysis indicated the presence of potentially functional SNPs in 9 other highly interactive proteins. The genes and their SNPs identified in the network-based analysis represent potential candidates for gene-gene and SNP-SNP interaction studies in cancer research.

Abstract: C-Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (Jab1) not only is full but also a subunit (CSN5) of the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome (CSN), which is an evolutionarily conserved and multifunctional protein that involves in controlling cellular proliferation and apoptosis, affecting a series of pathways, as well as regulating genomic instability and DNA damage and repair. The CSN is a highly conservative protein from yeast to human and interacts with the cullin-RING family of ubiquitin ligases so that it could be execute a process of removing NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like polypeptide (deneddylase activity). The role of Jab1/CSN5's multi-function has been proved as being oncogenic in nature, what is more, Jab1/CSN5 has been confirmed by much evidence that it participates in the carcinogenesis progression and is tightly associated with poor prognosis. However, the biologic implication of Jab1/CSN5 activity during the cancer's development is unclear. We performed a systematic literature review and assessment from PubMed and Medline databases in this article. Jab1/CSN5 is participate in a lot of biologic responses, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, DNA metabolism, invasion, DNA damage and repair, and recurrence. It also promotes cell transformation and tumorigenesis. In this review, we mainly expound the progress in the function and research advances of Jab1/CSN5 and in untangling the Jab1/CSN5 signaling pathway. Based on these bases, its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer can play a greater role in future cancer treatment. Journal: Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England). Year: 2016.

Abstract: Since the introduction of cisplatin-based therapy in the late 1970s, germ cell tumours (GCT) have been one of the successes in oncology with high cure rates even in patients presenting with metastatic disease. For patients with relapse after cisplatin-based therapy, treatment is still curative in approximately 50% of the cases. Management options for these patients include surgery, radiotherapy and use of conventional dose or high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT). Therefore, treatment of relapsed or refractory patients is complex and there is no uniformly accepted approach available. Data comparing conventional dose and HDCT in the first salvage therapy is limited to one randomized trial which was not able to ultimately define optimal treatment. More recently, a large retrospective analysis of nearly 1600 patients not only identified prognostic factors in relapse, but retrospectively suggested a 10-15% benefit regarding overall survival for patients receiving HDCT plus autologous stem cell transplantation over patients receiving conventional-dose chemotherapy. Prognosis in multiply relapsed and primary cisplatin-refractory patients is generally poor. Currently, a number of mechanisms of cisplatin resistance and potential drug targets like global methylation and BRAF mutation status are under investigation in refractory GCT.

Abstract: In the past decades, for the intermediate or advanced cancerous stages, preclinical and clinical applications of nanomedicines in cancer theranostics have been extensively studied. Nevertheless, decreased specificity and poor targeting efficiency with low target concentration of theranostic are the major drawbacks of nanomedicine in employing clinical substitution over conventional systemic therapy. Consequently, ligand decorated nanocarrier-mediated targeted drug delivery system can transcend the obstructions through their enhanced retention activity and increased permeability with effective targeting. The highly efficient and specific nanocarrier-mediated ligand-based active therapy is one of the novel and promising approaches for delivery of the therapeutics for different cancers in recent years to restrict various cancer growth in vivo without harming healthy cells. The article encapsulates the features of nanocarrier-mediated ligands in augmentation of active targeting approaches of various cancers and summarizes ligand-based targeted delivery systems in treatment of cancer as plausible theranostics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting AURKA in Cancer: molecular mechanisms and opportunities for Cancer therapy.. Abstract: Aurora kinase A (AURKA) belongs to the family of serine/threonine kinases, whose activation is necessary for cell division processes via regulation of mitosis. AURKA shows significantly higher expression in cancer tissues than in normal control tissues for multiple tumor types according to the TCGA database. Activation of AURKA has been demonstrated to play an important role in a wide range of cancers, and numerous AURKA substrates have been identified. AURKA-mediated phosphorylation can regulate the functions of AURKA substrates, some of which are mitosis regulators, tumor suppressors or oncogenes. In addition, enrichment of AURKA-interacting proteins with KEGG pathway and GO analysis have demonstrated that these proteins are involved in classic oncogenic pathways. All of this evidence favors the idea of AURKA as a target for cancer therapy, and some small molecules targeting AURKA have been discovered. These AURKA inhibitors (AKIs) have been tested in preclinical studies, and some of them have been subjected to clinical trials as monotherapies or in combination with classic chemotherapy or other targeted therapies.

Abstract: Genomic and transcriptomic sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to characterize prostate cancer at the molecular level. The underlying premise of next-generation sequencing technologies and their current and evolving applications in prostate cancer management are provided in the review. Improved methodologies are allowing timely sequencing of the coding regions or both the coding and noncoding regions of the genome to help identify potential mutations and structural variations in the prostate cancer genome, some of which are currently also targetable therapeutically. DNA microarray- based differential gene expression has been supplanted by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which not only allows for more accurate quantitation but also nucleotide-level resolution to investigate the entire transcriptome, including alternative gene spliced transcripts and noncoding RNA transcripts, whose full clinical implications have yet to be fully understood and realized. Gene classifier platforms that predict risk of recurrence or metastasis are being incorporated into prostate cancer management algorithms. In the appropriate clinical context, not only somatic but also germline mutation testing is being recommended. Continued clinical integration of sequencing technologies and ongoing research will lead to improved understanding of prostate cancer biology and prostate cancer treatment.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer is a highly lethal disease among all gynecologic malignancies and is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Although the standard combination of surgery and chemotherapy was initially effective in patients with ovarian cancer, disease relapse commonly occurred due to the generation of chemoresistance. It has been reported that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in drug resistance and cancer recurrence. Over the past decades, increasing studies have been done to identify CSCs from human ovarian cancer cells. The present paper will summarize different investigations on ovarian CSCs, including isolation, mechanisms of chemoresistance, and therapeutic approaches. Although there are still numerous challenges to translate basic research to clinical applications, understanding the molecular details of CSCs is essential for developing effective strategies to prevent ovarian cancer and its recurrence.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting mutant p53 for cancer therapy: direct and indirect strategies.. Abstract: TP53 is a critical tumor-suppressor gene that is mutated in more than half of all human cancers. Mutations in TP53 not only impair its antitumor activity, but also confer mutant p53 protein oncogenic properties. The p53-targeted therapy approach began with the identification of compounds capable of restoring/reactivating wild-type p53 functions or eliminating mutant p53. Treatments that directly target mutant p53 are extremely structure and drug-species-dependent. Due to the mutation of wild-type p53, multiple survival pathways that are normally maintained by wild-type p53 are disrupted, necessitating the activation of compensatory genes or pathways to promote cancer cell survival. Additionally, because the oncogenic functions of mutant p53 contribute to cancer proliferation and metastasis, targeting the signaling pathways altered by p53 mutation appears to be an attractive strategy. Synthetic lethality implies that while disruption of either gene alone is permissible among two genes with synthetic lethal interactions, complete disruption of both genes results in cell death. Thus, rather than directly targeting p53, exploiting mutant p53 synthetic lethal genes may provide additional therapeutic benefits. Additionally, research progress on the functions of noncoding RNAs has made it clear that disrupting noncoding RNA networks has a favorable antitumor effect, supporting the hypothesis that targeting noncoding RNAs may have potential synthetic lethal effects in cancers with p53 mutations. The purpose of this review is to discuss treatments for cancers with mutant p53 that focus on directly targeting mutant p53, restoring wild-type functions, and exploiting synthetic lethal interactions with mutant p53. Additionally, the possibility of noncoding RNAs acting as synthetic lethal targets for mutant p53 will be discussed. Journal: Journal of hematology & oncology. Year: 2021.

The role of p53 in tumour suppression is emphasized in addition by the observation that primary silencing with this protein occurred in more than 50% of cancers. MDM2, p53, and the p53-MDM2 connections are well-known targets for the prevention and treatment of cancer. Moreover, in tumors with wild-type p53, their efficacy is decreased due to MDM2 enlargement or by the gradual decrease of MDM2 blocker ARF. As a result, improving p53 activity in cancerous cells provides a promising anticancer strategy. Various techniques are now being investigated, and addressing the p53-MDM2 interaction had also evolved as a potentially feasible strategy for contending with tumors. Both p53 and MDM2, interact via an autoregulation response signal: p53 activity induces MDM2 transcription, which in response interacts with p53's N-terminal transactivation domain, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. This article provides information on the current scenario of anti-tumor activities, with a particular emphasis on structure-activity relationship characteristics (SAR) against the p53-MDM2 to treat cancer. The primary purpose of this review is to cover recent advancements in the creation and testing of anticancer drugs that target the p53-MDM2 structure. This review contains different heterocyclic moieties which show significant results toward cancer. A mechanistic route is shown here, demonstrating both normal and malignant conditions via several stressed factors. Several compounds entered clinical trials as p53-MDM2 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. Journal: European journal of medicinal chemistry. Year: 2023. Authors: Bhatia R, Kumar B.

Abstract: Myelofibrosis (MF) is the most aggressive form of Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm, and it is complicated by severe symptom burden, thrombotic events, infections, cytopenias, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ruxolitinib, the first-line therapy for symptomatic or intermediate- and high-prognostic risk MF, has improved overall survival for this population. However, approximately one-half of MF patients will discontinue ruxolitinib by the first few years of therapy due to a spectrum of resistance, intolerance, relapse, or progression to blast phase disease. Danazol, erythropoietin-stimulating agents, and spleen-directed therapies can be useful in the ruxolitinib-resistant setting. In the ruxolitinib-refractory or -intolerant setting, commercial and novel therapies, either alone or in combination with ruxolitinib, have shown clinical utility. For blast-phase MF, the recent advancements in available AML therapies have increased the options with targeted and more tolerable therapies. In this article, we will discuss our paradigm for the management of relapsed/refractory and blast-phase MF in the context of therapeutic advancements in both AML and MF. Journal: Hematology.

Platinum drugs, such as cisplatin (CDDP), oxaliplatin, and carboplatin, are extensively utilized for treating various cancers and have become the primary drugs in first-line treatments for numerous solid tumors due to their effective anticancer properties. However, their side effects, including drug resistance, nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, limit the clinical application. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop targeted delivery and controlled release systems for platinum drugs to address the disadvantages, enhancing tumor accumulation and improving therapeutic effects. In this review, we first review the progress of platinum drugs, their anticancer mechanism, clinical applications and limitations. Then, we comprehensively summarize the platinum-based delivery using drug carriers and responsive strategies. We especially highlight the platinum-delivery formulations in ongoing clinical trials. Finally, we provide perspectives for this field. The review could provide an increasingly in-depth understanding of platinum therapeutics and motivate increasing delivery tactics to overcome the limitations of platinum application.

Abstract: Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have found extensive use in delivering oncology therapeutics; however, some delivery vehicles still exhibit rapid immune clearance, lack of biocompatibility and insufficient targeting. In recent years, bionanoparticles constructed from tumour cell membranes have gained momentum as tumour-targeting therapeutic agents. Cancer cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (CCMCNPs) typically consist of a drug-loaded nanoparticle core coated with cancer cell membrane. CCMCNPs retain homologous tumour cell surface antigens, receptors and proteins, and it has been shown that the modified nanoparticles exhibit better homologous targeting, immune escape and biocompatibility. CCMCNPs are now widely used in a variety of cancer treatments, including photothermal, photodynamic and sonodynamic therapies, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, chemodynamical therapy or other combination therapies. This article presents different therapeutic approaches using multimodal antitumour therapy-combination of two or more therapies that treat tumours synergistically-based on tumour cell membrane systems. The advantages of CCMCNPs in different cancer treatments in recent years are summarised, thus, providing new strategies for cancer treatment research. Journal: Journal of drug targeting. Year: 2023.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Calcium Entry through TRPV1: A Potential Target for the Regulation of Proliferation and Apoptosis in Cancerous and Healthy Cells.. Abstract: Intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) is a key determinant of cell fate and is implicated in carcinogenesis. Membrane ion channels are structures through which ions enter or exit the cell, depending on the driving forces. The opening of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ligand-gated ion channels facilitates transmembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> entry, which modifies the delicate balance between apoptotic and proliferative signaling pathways. Proliferation is upregulated through two mechanisms: (1) ATP binding to the G-protein-coupled receptor P2Y2, commencing a kinase signaling cascade that activates the serine-threonine kinase Akt, and (2) the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), leading to a series of protein signals that activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2. The TRPV1-apoptosis pathway involves Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and efflux between the cytosol, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c from the mitochondria, caspase activation, and DNA fragmentation and condensation. While proliferative mechanisms are typically upregulated in cancerous tissues, shifting the balance to favor apoptosis could support anti-cancer therapies. TRPV1, through [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signaling, influences cancer cell fate; therefore, the modulation of the TRPV1-enforced proliferation-apoptosis balance is a promising avenue in developing anti-cancer therapies and overcoming cancer drug resistance. As such, this review characterizes and evaluates the role of TRPV1 in cell death and survival, in the interest of identifying mechanistic targets for drug discovery.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers due to its high metastasis rate in the liver. However, little is known about the molecular features of hepatic metastases due to difficulty in obtaining fresh tissues and low tumor cellularity. We conduct exome sequencing and RNA sequencing for synchronous surgically resected primary tumors and the paired hepatic metastases from 17 hepatic oligometastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and validate our findings in specimens from 35 of such cases. The comprehensive analysis of somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and gene expressions show high similarity between primary tumors and hepatic metastases. However, hepatic metastases also show unique characteristics, such as a higher degree of 3p21.1 loss, stronger abilities of proliferation, downregulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition activity, and metabolic rewiring. More interesting, altered tumor microenvironments are observed in hepatic metastases, especially a higher proportion of tumor infiltrating M2 macrophage and upregulation of complement cascade. Further experiments demonstrate that expression of C1q increases in primary tumors and hepatic metastases, C1q is mainly produced by M2 macrophage, and C1q promotes migration and invasion of PDAC cells. Taken together, we find potential factors that contribute to different stages of PDAC metastasis. Our study broadens the understanding of molecular mechanisms driving PDAC metastasis.

Abstract: Macrophages are immune cells with high heterogeneity and plasticity, crucial for recognizing and eliminating foreign substances, including cancer cells. However, cancer cells can evade the immune system by producing signals that cause macrophages to switch to a pro-tumor phenotype, promoting tumor growth and progression. Tumor-associated macrophages, which infiltrate into tumor tissue, are important immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and can regulate cancer's growth, invasion, and metastasis by inhibiting tumor immunity. This review article highlights the characteristics of tumor-associated macrophages and their role in the occurrence and development of cancer. It outlines how reprogramming macrophages towards an anti-tumor phenotype can improve the response to cancer therapy. Explore the intricate process of engineered nanoparticles serving as carriers for immunostimulatory molecules, activating macrophages to instigate an anti-tumor response. Finally, it summarizes several studies demonstrating targeting macrophages is a potential in preclinical cancer models. Several challenges must be addressed in developing effective macrophage-targeted therapies, such as the heterogeneity of macrophage subtypes and their plasticity. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying macrophage function in the tumor microenvironment and identify novel targets for macrophage-directed therapies. Targeting macrophages is a promising and innovative approach to improving cancer therapy and patient outcomes. Journal: Current drug delivery. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Reduction of breast cancer relapses with perioperative non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: new findings and a review.. Abstract: To explain a bimodal pattern of hazard of relapse among early stage breast cancer patients identified in multiple databases, we proposed that late relapses result from steady stochastic progressions from single dormant malignant cells to avascular micrometastases and then on to growing deposits. However in order to explain early relapses, we had to postulate that something happens at about the time of surgery to provoke sudden exits from dormant phases to active growth and then to detection. Most relapses in breast cancer are in the early category. Recent data from Forget et al. suggest an unexpected mechanism. They retrospectively studied results from 327 consecutive breast cancer patients comparing various perioperative analgesics and anesthetics in one Belgian hospital and one surgeon. Patients were treated with mastectomy and conventional adjuvant therapy. Relapse hazard updated Sept 2011 are presented. A common Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) analgesic used in surgery produced far superior disease-free survival in the first 5 years after surgery. The expected prominent early relapse events in months 9-18 are reduced 5-fold. If this observation holds up to further scrutiny, it could mean that the simple use of this safe, inexpensive and effective anti-inflammatory agent at surgery might eliminate early relapses. Transient systemic inflammation accompanying surgery could facilitate angiogenesis of dormant micrometastases, proliferation of dormant single cells, and seeding of circulating cancer stem cells (perhaps in part released from bone marrow) resulting in early relapse and could have been effectively blocked by the perioperative anti-inflammatory agent.

USPs present an attractive reservoir of drug targets that could potentially overcome the shortcomings of conventional pathway-specific cancer therapies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Resistance to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy in relapsing acute promyelocytic leukemia: study of in vitro ATRA sensitivity and cellular retinoic acid binding protein levels in leukemic cells.. Abstract: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces leukemic cell differentiation and complete remission (CR) in a high proportion of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML3 subtype). However, relapses occur when ATRA is prescribed as maintenance therapy, and resistance to a second ATRA-induction therapy is frequently observed. An induced hypercatabolism of ATRA has been suggested as a possible mechanism leading to reduced ATRA sensitivity and resistance. CRABPII, an RA cytoplasmic binding protein linked to RA's metabolization pathway, is induced by ATRA in different cell systems. To investigate whether specific features of the AML3 cells at relapse could explain the in vivo resistance observed, we studied the CRABP levels and in vitro sensitivity to ATRA of AML3 cells before and at relapse from ATRA. Relapse-AML3 cells (n = 12) showed reduced differentiation induction when compared with \"virgin\"-AML3 cells (n = 31; P < .05). Dose-response studies were performed in 2 cases at relapse and showed decreased sensitivity to low ATRA concentrations. CRABPII levels and in vitro differentiation characteristics of AML3 cells before and at relapse from ATRA therapy were studied concomittantly in 4 patients. High levels of CRABPII (median, 20 fmol/mg of protein) were detected in the cells of the 4 patients at relapse but were not detected before ATRA therapy. Three of these patients showed a decrease in differentiation induction of their leukemic cells, and a failure to achieve CR with a second induction therapy of ATRA 45 mg/m2/day was noted in all patients treated (n = 3). Results from this study provide evidence to support the hypothesis of induced-ATRA metabolism as one of the major mechanisms responsible for ATRA resistance. Monitoring CRABPII levels after ATRA withdrawal may help to determine when to administer ATRA in the maintenance or relapse therapy of AML3 patients. Journal: Blood. Year: 1993.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Precision Combination Therapies Based on Recurrent Oncogenic Coalterations.. Abstract: Cancer cells depend on multiple driver alterations whose oncogenic effects can be suppressed by drug combinations. Here, we provide a comprehensive resource of precision combination therapies tailored to oncogenic coalterations that are recurrent across patient cohorts. To generate the resource, we developed Recurrent Features Leveraged for Combination Therapy (REFLECT), which integrates machine learning and cancer informatics algorithms. Using multiomic data, the method maps recurrent coalteration signatures in patient cohorts to combination therapies. We validated the REFLECT pipeline using data from patient-derived xenografts, in vitro drug screens, and a combination therapy clinical trial. These validations demonstrate that REFLECT-selected combination therapies have significantly improved efficacy, synergy, and survival outcomes. In patient cohorts with immunotherapy response markers, DNA repair aberrations, and HER2 activation, we have identified therapeutically actionable and recurrent coalteration signatures. REFLECT provides a resource and framework to design combination therapies tailored to tumor cohorts in data-driven clinical trials and preclinical studies. We developed the predictive bioinformatics platform REFLECT and a multiomics- based precision combination therapy resource. The REFLECT-selected therapies lead to significant improvements in efficacy and patient survival in preclinical and clinical settings. Use of REFLECT can optimize therapeutic benefit through selection of drug combinations tailored to molecular signatures of tumors. See related commentary by Pugh and Haibe-Kains, p. 1416.

Abstract: <b>Purpose:</b> We investigated whether detection of ctDNA after resection of colorectal cancer identifies the patients with the highest risk of relapse and, furthermore, whether longitudinal ctDNA analysis allows early detection of relapse and informs about response to intervention.<b>Experimental Design:</b> In this longitudinal cohort study, we used massively parallel sequencing to identify somatic mutations and used these as ctDNA markers to detect minimal residual disease and to monitor changes in tumor burden during a 3-year follow-up period.<b>Results:</b> A total of 45 patients and 371 plasma samples were included. Longitudinal samples from 27 patients revealed ctDNA postoperatively in all relapsing patients (<i>n</i> = 14), but not in any of the nonrelapsing patients. ctDNA detected relapse with an average lead time of 9.4 months compared with CT imaging. Of 21 patients treated for localized disease, six had ctDNA detected within 3 months after surgery. All six later relapsed compared with four of the remaining patients [HR, 37.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.2-335.5; <i>P</i> < 0.001]. The ability of a 3-month ctDNA analysis to predict relapse was confirmed in 23 liver metastasis patients (HR 4.9; 95% CI, 1.5-15.7; <i>P</i> = 0.007). Changes in ctDNA levels induced by relapse intervention (<i>n</i> = 19) showed good agreement with changes in tumor volume (\u03ba = 0.41; Spearman <i>\u03c1</i> = 0.4).<b>Conclusions:</b> Postoperative ctDNA detection provides evidence of residual disease and identifies patients at very high risk of relapse. Longitudinal surveillance enables early detection of relapse and informs about response to intervention. These observations have implications for the postoperative management of colorectal cancer patients. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(18); 5437-45. \u00a92017 AACR</i>.

Abstract: Bone metastases are present in up to 70% of advanced prostate and breast cancers and occur at significant rates in a variety of other cancers. Bone metastases can be associated with significant morbidity. The establishment of bone metastasis activates several immunosuppressive mechanisms. Hence, understanding the tumor-bone microenvironment is crucial to inform the development of novel therapies. This review describes the current standard of care for patients with bone metastatic disease and novel treatment options targeting the microenvironment. Treatments reviewed include immunotherapies, cryoablation, and targeted therapies. Combinatorial treatment strategies including targeted therapies and immunotherapies show promise in pre-clinical and clinical studies to overcome the suppressive environment and improve treatment of bone metastases.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of cellular behavior and response to the tumor microenvironment (TME) in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains elusive. Here, we introduce the high-definition Visium spatial transcriptomic technology (Visium HD) and investigate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human CRC samples (n\u2009=\u20095). We demonstrate the high sensitivity, single-cell-scale resolution and spatial accuracy of Visium HD, generating a highly refined whole-transcriptome spatial profile of CRC samples. We identify transcriptomically distinct macrophage subpopulations in different spatial niches with potential pro-tumor and anti-tumor functions via interactions with tumor and T cells. In situ gene expression analysis validates our findings and localizes a clonally expanded T cell population close to macrophages with anti-tumor features. Our study demonstrates the power of high-resolution spatial technologies to understand cellular interactions in the TME and paves the way for larger studies that will unravel mechanisms and biomarkers of CRC biology, improving diagnosis and disease management strategies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Subtype-associated epigenomic landscape and 3D genome structure in bladder cancer.. Abstract: Muscle-invasive bladder cancers are characterized by their distinct expression of luminal and basal genes, which could be used to predict key clinical features such as disease progression and overall survival. Transcriptionally, FOXA1, GATA3, and PPARG are shown to be essential for luminal subtype-specific gene regulation and subtype switching, while TP63, STAT3, and TFAP2 family members are critical for regulation of basal subtype-specific genes. Despite these advances, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms and 3D chromatin architecture responsible for subtype-specific regulation in bladder cancer remain unknown. RESULT: We determine the genome-wide transcriptome, enhancer landscape, and transcription factor binding profiles of FOXA1 and GATA3 in luminal and basal subtypes of bladder cancer. Furthermore, we report the first-ever mapping of genome-wide chromatin interactions by Hi-C in both bladder cancer cell lines and primary patient tumors. We show that subtype-specific transcription is accompanied by specific open chromatin and epigenomic marks, at least partially driven by distinct transcription factor binding at distal enhancers of luminal and basal bladder cancers. Finally, we identify a novel clinically relevant transcription factor, Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2 (NPAS2), in luminal bladder cancers that regulates other subtype-specific genes and influences cancer cell proliferation and migration. CONCLUSION: In summary, our work identifies unique epigenomic signatures and 3D genome structures in luminal and basal urinary bladder cancers and suggests a novel link between the circadian transcription factor NPAS2 and a clinical bladder cancer subtype.

Abstract: Although new drug classes have significantly extended survival of patients with multiple myeloma, they continue to experience multiple relapses and/or become refractory to treatment. Therefore, novel therapies and treatment combinations with different mechanisms of action are needed to improve the outcomes of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Here, the authors review the published data regarding the development and clinical investigation of isatuximab, a CD38 monoclonal antibody, for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety of isatuximab treatment are summarized. Isatuximab is approved in combination with pomalidomide/dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Isatuximab displays a manageable safety profile, with infusion reactions being the most common adverse events. Isatuximab is currently being further evaluated in combination with other backbone regimens in relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Journal: Expert opinion on biological therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeted immunotherapy to cancer stem cells: A novel strategy of anticancer immunotherapy.. Abstract: Cancer is a major disease that endangers human health. Cancer drug resistance and relapse are the two main causes contributing to cancer treatment failure. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small fraction of tumor cells that are responsible for tumorigenesis, metastasis, relapse, and resistance to conventional anticancer therapies. Therefore, CSCs are considered to be the root of cancer recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance. Novel anticancer strategies need to face this new challenge and explore their efficacy against CSCs. Recently, immunotherapy has made rapid advances in cancer treatment, and its potential against CSCs is also an interesting area of research. Meanwhile, immunotherapy strategies are novel therapeutic modalities with promising results in targeting CSCs. In this review, we summarize the targeting of CSCs by various immunotherapy strategies such as monoclonal antibodies(mAb), tumor vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and chimeric antigen receptor-T cells(CAR-T) in pre-clinical and clinical studies. This review provides new insights into the application of these immunotherapeutic approaches to potential anti-tumor therapies in the future. Journal: Critical reviews in oncology/hematology.

Abstract: Outcomes for teenage and young adult (TYA) patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who relapse on contemporary risk-adapted paediatric protocols are largely unknown and there is no consensus on optimal salvage strategies. We assessed the treatment and outcome of TYA patients (aged 16-24\u00a0years) recruited to the UKALL2003 trial, who relapsed following attainment of complete morphological remission. Forty-two of 223 patients (18\u00b78%) relapsed, the majority (n\u00a0=\u00a026, 62%) on treatment. Thirty-eight (90%) patients received salvage treatment, with 22 (58%) achieving second remission (CR2) and 21 patients receiving an allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplant (alloHSCT). Post-relapse outcomes were poor with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 23% (95% confidence interval; 11-37%). Outcomes for patients relapsing on active treatment were inferior to those relapsing after completing treatment (5-year OS 9% vs. 52%, log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7001). No patient with B cell ALL relapsing on treatment was alive at the end of the study period. TYA patients with ALL who relapse on the UK paediatric protocol, UKALL2003, are largely unsalvageable with conventional approaches aimed at achieving CR2 followed by alloHSCT. Future efforts should be aimed at identifying those patients who are destined to relapse and exploring novel treatment approaches for this high-risk group and for those who do relapse.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Clinical Utility of the Detection of the Loss of the Mismatched HLA in Relapsed Hematological Patients After Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation With High-Dose Cyclophosphamide.. Abstract: Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Haplo-HSCT) with high-dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has resulted in a low incidence of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), graft failure, and non-relapse mortality. However, post-transplantation relapse remains a common cause of treatment failure in high-risk patients. Unraveling the mechanisms of relapse is therefore crucial for designing effective relapse treatment strategies. One of these mechanisms is the loss of the mismatched HLA on the recipient's leukemic cells. To study the incidence and clinical relevance of this phenomenon, we analyzed 181 patients treated with Haplo-HSCT with PTCy (2007-2019), of which 37 relapsed patients after transplantation. According to the kit employed for HLA-loss analysis, among 22 relapsed patients, we identified HLA loss at relapse in 6 of the 22 patients (27%) studied. Based on the results obtained, the genomic loss of HLA was more common in females than males (66 vs. 33%) and HLA-loss relapses occurred later than classical relapses (345 vs. 166 days). Moreover, the patients with HLA-loss had a greater presence of active disease at the time of transplantation and had undergone a larger number of treatment lines than the group with classical relapses (66 vs. 43% and 66 vs. 18%, respectively). Four of these relapses were studied retrospectively, while two were studied prospectively, the results of which could be considered for patient management. Additionally, two relapsed patients analyzed retrospectively had myeloid neoplasms. One patient had not undergone any treatment, and three had undergone donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) and chemotherapy. All presented severe GVHD and disease progression. In contrast, the two patients studied prospectively had a lymphoid neoplasm and were not treated with DLIs. One of them was treated with chemotherapy but died from disease progression, and the other patient underwent a second Haplo-HSCT from a different donor and is still alive. We can conclude that the detection of HLA-loss at the onset of relapse after Haplo-HSCT with PTCy could help in clinical practice to select appropriate rescue treatment, thereby avoiding the use of DLIs or a second transplantation from the same donor.

Abstract: Several randomised trials have confirmed the benefit of adjuvant trastuzumab for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. However, concern has been expressed that adjuvant trastuzumab might be associated with an increased frequency of CNS relapses. We assessed the frequency and course of CNS relapses, either as first event or at any time, using data from the HERA trial. We estimated the cumulative incidence of first disease-free survival (DFS) events in the CNS versus other sites by competing risks analysis in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who had been randomly assigned to receive 1 year of trastuzumab or to observation in the HERA trial after a median follow-up of 4 years (IQR 3\u00b75-4\u00b78). To obtain further information about CNS relapse at any time before death, we circulated a data collection form to investigators to obtain standardised information about CNS events that occurred in all patients who had died before July, 2009. We estimated the cumulative incidence of CNS relapse at any time with a competing risks analysis. Of 3401 patients who had been assigned to receive 1 year of trastuzumab or to observation, 69 (2%) had a CNS relapse as first DFS event and 747 (22%) had a first DFS event not in the CNS. The frequency of CNS relapses as first DFS event did not differ between the group given 1 year of trastuzumab (37 [2%] of 1703 patients) and the observation group (32 [2%] of 1698; p=0\u00b755 [Gray's test]). 481 data collection forms were distributed, of which 413 (86%) were returned. The proportion of patients who had died and experienced a CNS relapse was numerically higher in the observation group (129 [57%] of 227) than in the group given trastuzumab for 1 year (88 [47%] of 186; p=0\u00b706 [Gray's test]). Most CNS relapses were symptomatic (189 [87%] of 217). Adjuvant trastuzumab does not increase the risk of CNS relapse in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. None. Journal: The Lancet.

Abstract: Despite the great progress in our understanding of the molecular basis of human cancer, the heterogeneity of individual tumors and the evolutionary pressures imposed by therapy have hampered our ability to effectively eradicate and control this disease. How, therefore, do cancers evolve under the selective pressures of cancer therapy? Recent studies have linked both primary (or de novo) and acquired treatment resistance to intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution. Resistance to targeted therapies often includes mutation of the drug target itself and aberrations of pathways upstream of, downstream from, or parallel to the drug target. For systemic chemotherapies, discrete and recurrent resistance-conferring genetic aberrations have eluded the community, due in part to their wide-ranging mutagenic effects. In this review, we discuss different patterns of clonal evolution during treatment-specific selective pressures and focus on the genetic mechanisms of treatment resistance that have emerged to both targeted therapies and chemotherapies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Paradoxical effects of chemotherapy on tumor relapse and metastasis promotion.. Abstract: Several lines of compelling pre-clinical evidence identify chemotherapy as a potentially double-edged sword: therapeutic efficacy on the primary tumor may in fact be counterbalanced by the induction of tumor/host reactive responses supportive for survival and dissemination of cancer cell subpopulations. This paradoxical effect of chemotherapy can affect different districts such as the primary tumor, the circulation and distant organs by simultaneously shaping properties and composition of tumor and stromal cells. At the primary tumor site, chemotherapy has been reported to promote selection of chemoresistant and disseminating tumor cells endowed with properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs) through activation of autocrine and paracrine self-renewing/survival pathways promoted jointly by therapy-selected tumor and stromal cells. Resistant CSCs represent seeds for tumor relapse and increased infiltration by immune cells, together with enhanced vascular permeability induced by chemotherapy, facilitates tumor cells intravasation, the first step of the metastatic cascade. As a consequence of primary tumor/metastasis re-shaping induced by chemotherapy, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detected during therapy can display a shift towards a more mesenchymal and stem-like phenotype, conductive to increased ability to survive in the circulation and seed distant organs. At the metastatic site, host responses to therapy activate inflammatory pathways that ultimately facilitate tumor cells extravasation and metastatic colonization. Finally, cooperation of immune cells and endothelial cells at perivascular niches favors the extravasation of tumor cells endowed with high potential for metastasis initiation and protects them from chemotherapy. This review highlights the paradoxical pro-metastatic effects of chemotherapy linking reactive responses to treatment to tumor relapse and metastasis formation through primary tumor remodeling and generation of a favorable pro-metastatic niche.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors remain integral for the treatment of NSCLCs that do not have specific actionable genetic mutations.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The Prognostic and Drug-targeting Value of Lymphoid Enhancer-binding Factor-1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.. Abstract: Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor-1 (LEF1) was previously reported to contribute to a variety of malignancies, including Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). However, its role in HCC is poorly understood. To explore the role of LEF1 in HCC, including its prognostic and drug-targeting value. The LEF1 expression and patient characteristics were investigated. The associations between clinical characteristics and LEF1 were analyzed using both univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to explore the clinicopathological factors related to overall survival in patients with HCC. A nomogram to predict the survival rate was constructed and validated. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG) was used to explore the function of LEF1. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was also performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Furthermore, compounds that may have the potential to be targeted drugs in the treatment of LEF1-overexpressing HCC were identified using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), patents about these drugs in HCC were also reviewed through Worldwide Espacenet\u00ae and Patentscope\u00ae. Increased expression of LEF1 was significantly associated with high histological grade of HCC (odds ratio (OR) = 2.521 for grade (G) 2 vs. G1, OR = 2.550 for G3 vs. G1, OR = 7.081 for G4 vs. G1, all P < 0.05). A Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that HCC patients with LEF1 overexpression had a poor prognosis compared with those with normal LEF1 expression (P = 0.025). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that LEF1 is an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival of patients with HCC (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.095; P = 0.04). The constructed nomogram to predict the survival rate produced a statistically significant prediction (area under the curve (AUC) = 86.68). In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis of genes co-expressed with the protein showed that LEF1 was associated with transcriptional regulation. GSEA suggested that the cell cycle, the WNT signaling pathway, and the NOTCH signaling pathway may be the key pathways regulated by LEF1 in HCC. Furthermore, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) identified nine compounds that may have the potential to be targeted drugs in the treatment of LEF1-overexpressing HCC. Patent reviews suggested that these drugs may show some efficacy in HCC, but whether these drugs interact with LEF1 and improve the prognosis for patients with HCC remains to be explored. LEF1 is a latent prognostic molecular biomarker of HCC. The cell cycle, and WNT and NOTCH signaling pathways are regulated by LEF1 in HCC. LEF1 could be a potential drug target for HCC.

Abstract: First discovered in the 1984, the MET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor or HGF (also known as scatter factor or SF) are implicated as key players in tumor cell migration, proliferation, and invasion in a variety of cancers. This pathway also plays a key role during embryogenesis in the development of muscular and nervous structures. High expression of the MET receptor has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. MET exon 14 splicing variants, initially identified by us in lung cancer, is actionable through various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). For this reason, this pathway is of interest as a therapeutic target. In this chapter we will be discussing the history of MET, the genetics of this RTK, and give some background on the receptor biology. Furthermore, we will discuss directed therapeutics, mechanisms of resistance, and the future of MET as a therapeutic target. Journal: Advances in cancer research. Year: 2020.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: FOXO Signaling Pathways as Therapeutic Targets in Cancer.. Abstract: Many transcription factors play a key role in cellular differentiation and the delineation of cell phenotype. Transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation/deacetylation and interactions between two or more proteins controlling multiple signaling pathways. These pathways regulate different physiological processes and pathological events, such as cancer and other diseases. The Forkhead box O (FOXO) is one subfamily of the fork head transcription factor family with important roles in cell fate decisions and this subfamily is also suggested to play a pivotal functional role as a tumor suppressor in a wide range of cancers. During apoptosis, FOXOs are involved in mitochondria-dependent and -independent processes triggering the expression of death receptor ligands like Fas ligand, TNF apoptosis ligand and Bcl\u2011X<sub>L,</sub> bNIP3, Bim from Bcl-2 family members. Different types of growth factors like insulin play a vital role in the regulation of FOXOs. The most important pathway interacting with FOXO in different types of cancers is the PI3K/AKT pathway. Some other important pathways such as the Ras-MEK-ERK, IKK and AMPK pathways are also associated with FOXOs in tumorigenesis. Therapeutically targeting the FOXO signaling pathway(s) could lead to the discovery and development of efficacious agents against some cancers, but this requires an enhanced understanding and knowledge of FOXO transcription factors and their regulation and functioning. This review focused on the current understanding of cell biology of FOXO transcription factors which relates to their potential role as targets for the treatment and prevention of human cancers. We also discuss drugs which are currently being used for cancer treatment along with their target pathways and also point out some potential drawbacks of those drugs, which further signifies the need for development of new drug strategies in the field of cancer treatment.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Prognostic and functional role of the nuclear export receptor 1 (XPO1) in gastrointestinal cancers: a potential novel target?. Abstract: In the last decades the survival of metastatic gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients could have been significantly extended due to the introduction of targeted- and immunotherapy. However, only the minority of patients will experience long-lasting survival. Hence, novel therapeutics are clearly necessary for GI cancer patients. Molecular high-throughput profiling techniques have revealed potential novel targetable molecular alterations, emphasizing the necessity for tailored therapeutic approaches. Nuclear export proteins, particularly Exportin-1 (XPO1), have emerged as promising targets in cancer therapy due to their crucial role in cellular homeostasis and regulation of key cellular functions. Dysregulation of XPO1-mediated nuclear export leads to the functional loss of tumor suppressors and pro-apoptotic factors, facilitating cancer progression. Selinexor, a XPO1 inhibitor, has shown promising activity in preclinical and clinical studies, particularly in hematological malignancies. However, its efficacy in GI cancers remains underexplored. This review aims to elucidate the functional and pathophysiological role of XPO1 in GI cancers. Despite the potential of XPO1 inhibitors in suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, comprehensive molecular landscape data and validation of selective inhibitors in GI cancers are lacking. Targeting XPO1 presents a significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of GI cancer patients. Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the molecular landscape according to XPO1 expression in GI tumors and to validate the efficacy of selective XPO1 inhibitors. These efforts are expected to contribute to the development of more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies for GI cancer patients. Journal: Molecular biology reports. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Pan-cancer identification of clinically relevant genomic subtypes using outcome-weighted integrative clustering.. Abstract: Comprehensive molecular profiling has revealed somatic variations in cancer at genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels. The accumulating data has shown clearly that molecular phenotypes of cancer are complex and influenced by a multitude of factors. Conventional unsupervised clustering applied to a large patient population is inevitably driven by the dominant variation from major factors such as cell-of-origin or histology. Translation of these data into clinical relevance requires more effective extraction of information directly associated with patient outcome. Drawing from ideas in supervised text classification, we developed survClust, an outcome-weighted clustering algorithm for integrative molecular stratification focusing on patient survival. survClust was performed on 18 cancer types across multiple data modalities including somatic mutation, DNA copy number, DNA methylation, and mRNA, miRNA, and protein expression from the Cancer Genome Atlas study to identify novel prognostic subtypes. Our analysis identified the prognostic role of high tumor mutation burden with concurrently high CD8 T cell immune marker expression and the aggressive clinical behavior associated with CDKN2A deletion across cancer types. Visualization of somatic alterations, at a genome-wide scale (total mutation burden, mutational signature, fraction genome altered) and at the individual gene level, using circomap further revealed indolent versus aggressive subgroups in a pan-cancer setting. Our analysis has revealed prognostic molecular subtypes not previously identified by unsupervised clustering. The algorithm and tools we developed have direct utility toward patient stratification based on tumor genomics to inform clinical decision-making.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Emerging technologies for studying DNA methylation for the molecular diagnosis of cancer.. Abstract: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that plays a key role in regulating gene expression and other functions. Although this modification is seen in different sequence contexts, the most frequently detected DNA methylation in mammals involves cytosine-guanine dinucleotides. Pathological alterations in DNA methylation patterns are described in a variety of human diseases, including cancer. Unlike genetic changes, DNA methylation is heavily influenced by subtle modifications in the cellular microenvironment. In all cancers, aberrant DNA methylation is involved in the alteration of a large number of oncological pathways with relevant theranostic utility. Several technologies for DNA methylation mapping have been developed recently and successfully applied in cancer studies. The scope of these technologies varies from assessing a single cytosine-guanine locus to genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation. Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in the context of clinical utility for the molecular diagnosis of human cancers. Journal: Expert review of molecular diagnostics.

Conventional therapies, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have achieved increased survival rates for many types of cancer over the past decades. However, cancer recurrence and/or metastasis to distant organs remain major challenges, resulting in a large, unmet clinical need. Oligonucleotide therapeutics, which include antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, and aptamers, show promising clinical outcomes for disease indications such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, familial amyloid neuropathies, and macular degeneration. While no approved oligonucleotide drug currently exists for any type of cancer, results obtained in preclinical studies and clinical trials are encouraging. Here, we provide an overview of recent developments in the field of oligonucleotide therapeutics in oncology, review current clinical trials, and discuss associated challenges.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Insights into intricacies of the Latent Membrane Protein-1 (LMP-1) in EBV-associated cancers.. Abstract: Numerous lymphomas, carcinomas, and other disorders have been associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. EBV's carcinogenic potential can be correlated to latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which is essential for fibroblast and primary lymphocyte transformation. LMP1, a transmembrane protein with constitutive activity, belongs to the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. LMP1 performs number of role in the life cycle of EBV and the pathogenesis by interfering with, reprogramming, and influencing a vast range of host cellular activities and functions that are getting well-known but still poorly understood. LMP1, pleiotropically perturbs, reprograms and balances a wide range of various processes of cell such as extracellular vesicles, epigenetics, ubiquitin machinery, metabolism, cell proliferation and survival, and also promotes oncogenic transformation, angiogenesis, anchorage-independent cell growth, metastasis and invasion, tumour microenvironment. By the help of various experiments, it is proven that EBV-encoded LMP1 activates multiple cell signalling pathways which affect antigen presentation, cell-cell interactions, chemokine and cytokine production. Therefore, it is assumed that LMP1 may perform majorly in EBV associated malignancies. For the development of novel techniques toward targeted therapeutic applications, it is essential to have a complete understanding of the LMP1 signalling landscape in order to identify potential targets. The focus of this review is on LMP1-interacting proteins and related signalling processes. We further discuss tactics for using the LMP1 protein as a potential therapeutic for cancers caused by the EBV. Journal: Life sciences. Year: 2023. Authors: Awasthi P, Dwivedi M, Kumar D, Hasan S.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Lenalidomide in myeloma.. Abstract: The standard treatment approach to symptomatic myeloma consists of induction therapy, consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in appropriate patients, maintenance therapy, and salvage therapy. Salvage therapy is of particular importance because not all patients respond to primary therapy, and relapse is virtually universal in responding patients. Newer agents such as thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide are very active in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Their use singly and in combination results in excellent cytoreduction including complete remissions in patients relapsing - even after extensive prior therapy. These novel agents have been usually used as salvage therapy in patients relapsing after standard treatment options including transplantation; a setting in which they are thought to improve survival. However, there is an increasing trend to start using them early in the course of the disease; for induction therapy. While early deployment of these agents is certainly associated with high-response rates, evidence that this improves long-term outcome (survival) in patients who subsequently undergo intensive therapy and transplantation is lacking. Toxicity, expense, and possible long-term consequences on the biology of the disease (for example, development of refractory relapse) remain a concern. The most appropriate use of newer agents such as lenalidomide is as salvage therapy of relapsed or refractory disease, and their use as part of induction therapy should be confined to clinical trials until additional data and long-term follow-up are available.

Abstract: Breast cancer comprises several molecular subtypes with distinct clinical features and treatment responses, and a substantial portion of each subtype remains incurable. A comprehensive analysis of multi-omics data and clinical profiles is required in order to better understand the biological complexity of this cancer type and to identify new prognostic and therapeutic markers. Thus, there arises a need for useful analytical tools to assist in the investigation and clinical management of the disease. We developed Cancer Target Gene Screening (CTGS), a web application that provides rapid and user-friendly analysis of multi-omics data sets from a large number of primary breast tumors. It allows the investigation of genomic and epigenomic aberrations, evaluation of transcriptomic profiles and performance of survival analyses and of bivariate correlations between layers of omics data. Notably, the genome-wide screening function of CTGS prioritizes candidate genes of clinical and biological significance among genes with copy number alteration, DNA methylation and dysregulated expression by the integrative analysis of different types of omics data in customized subgroups of breast cancer patients. These features may help in the identification of druggable cancer driver genes in a specific subtype or the clinical condition of human breast cancer. CTGS is available at http://ctgs.biohackers.net.

Abstract: Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumors and the main reason for cancer-related death around the world, whereas nonsmall cell lung cancer that consists two subtypes: lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is responsible for an estimated 85% of all lung cancers. The current study aimed to explore gene expression and methylation differences between LUAD and LUSC. EdgeR was used to identify differentially regulated genes between normal and cancer in the LUAD and LUSC extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively, whereas SAM was used to find genes with differential methylation between normal and cancer in the LUAD and LUSC, respectively. Finally, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed to analyze the function which these genes enriched in. A total of 391 genes with opposite methylation patterns in LUAD and LUSC and four functional pathways were obtained (false discovery rate (FDR)\u2009<\u20090.1). These pathways mainly included fat digestion and absorption, phenylalanine metabolism, bile secretion, and so on, which were related to the airframe nutrition metabolic pathway. Moreover, two genes CTSE (cathepsin E) and solute carrier family 5 member 7 (SLC5A7) were also found, among which CTSE was overexpressed and hypomethylated in LUAD corresponding to normal lung tissues, whereas SLC5A7 showed the opposite in LUAD. In conclusion, this study investigated the differences between the gene expression and methylation patterns in LUAD and LUSC, and explored their different biological characteristics. Further understanding of these differences may promote the discovery and development of new, accurate strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer.

Abstract: There is currently no standard treatment for relapsed and arsenic trioxide (ATO)-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Here, we report a case series of realgar-indigo naturalis formula (RIF) for the successful treatment of patients with relapsed and ATO-resistant APL. Two patients in the first relapse and one in the second relapse failed to achieve hematologic complete remission (HCR) when reinduced by ATO; the other five patients progressed to relapse during ATO-based regimens for post-remission therapy. These eight patients received RIF in three doses per day totaling 130\u00a0mg/kg (\u2264 30 pills) as induction therapy and achieved HCR at a median time of 46.5\u00a0days. They received 5\u00a0years of post-remission therapy, which consisted of combined chemotherapy followed by RIF. During this period, the patients did not experience renal dysfunction or QT interval prolongation. At the last follow-up, three patients survived without relapse, two patients survived with a second or third relapse and third or fourth remission, and the other three patients relapsed for a third or fourth time and died. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 75.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 31.5-93.1) and 37.5% (95% CI: 5.6-71.7), respectively. RIF for induction therapy and RIF combined with chemotherapy for post-remission therapy may represent an effective and safe protocol for the treatment of patients with relapsed and ATO-resistant APL.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Potential Target of CDK6 Signaling Pathway for Cancer Treatment.. Abstract: Cancer involves uncontrolled cell growth due to genetic mutations. Tumors can form when CDK6, a gene essential for controlling cell growth, isn't working correctly. Researchers are investigating drugs that inhibit CDK6; some of them appear promising. Nevertheless, CDK6 is advantageous and harmful to cancer because it controls other cellular processes. By inhibiting CDK6 and CDK4, CDK4/6 inhibitors offer a novel therapeutic strategy that stops cell proliferation. The study investigates the function of CDK6 in cancer, the difficulties in targeting CDK6, and possible remedies. Scientists have developed drugs designed to block CDK6 and prevent it from altering other proteins. These drugs, also known as CDK6 inhibitors, help treat cancer. Finding the best drugs for CDK6 is still tricky, though. The drugs' selectivity, potency, and cost are some difficulties. These factors depend on CDK6's structure and interactions with other proteins. The structure of CDK6 and how it influences its function and regulation are explained in this review. It also describes CDK6's function in cancer and its interaction with other molecules and proteins, which is crucial for cell division. This review also discusses the present and upcoming therapies that target CDK6, as well as how CDK6 interacts with drugs that block it. This review presents the structure, current research, and overview of CDK6. It also reviews the role of CDK6 in cancer, function, and regulation. Additionally, it explores its role in cancer signaling networks and its interaction with CDK6 inhibitors. Lastly, it discusses the current status and prospects of therapies targeting CDK6.

Abstract: Recent advances in laboratory sciences hold a promise for a 'leap forward' in understanding the aetiology of complex human diseases, notably cancer, potentially providing an evidence base for prevention. For example, remarkable advances in epigenomics have an important impact on our understanding of biological phenomena and importance of environmental stressors in complex diseases. Environmental and lifestyle factors are thought to be implicated in the development of a wide range of human cancers by eliciting changes in the epigenome. These changes, thus, represent attractive targets for biomarker discovery intended for the improvement of exposure and risk assessment, diagnosis and prognosis and provision of short-term outcomes in intervention studies. The epigenome can be viewed as an interface between the genome and the environment; therefore, aberrant epigenetic events associated with environmental exposures are likely to play an important role in the onset and progression of different human diseases. The advent of powerful technologies for analysing epigenetic patterns in both cancer tissues and normal cells holds promise that the next few years will be fundamental for the identification of critical cancer- and exposure-associated epigenetic changes and for their evaluation as new generation of biomarkers. Here, we discuss new opportunities in the current age of 'omics' technologies for studies with prospective design and associated biospecimens that represent exciting potential for characterising the epigenome as a key component of the fetal exposome and for understanding causal pathways and robust predictors of cancer risk and associated environmental determinants during in utero life. Such studies should improve our knowledge concerning the aetiology of childhood cancer and identify both novel biomarkers and clues to causation, thus, providing an evidence base for cancer prevention.

Abstract: Due to the high heterogeneity of breast cancers, numerous recent patents describe improved methods of detection and classification which promise better patient prognosis and treatment. In particular, there has been a shift towards more effective genetic screening to identify specific mutations associated with breast tumours, which may lead to \"personalised medicine\" with improved outcomes. Two challenging areas of breast cancer research involve the development of treatments for the highly aggressive triple negative breast cancer subtype as well as the chemotherapy-resistant cancer stem cell subpopulation. In addition, despite numerous recent advances in breast cancer treatment in woman, male breast cancer remains poorly understood and there are limited therapies available which are developed specifically for men. This review serves to report on important developments in the treatment of breast malignancies patented in the past two years as well as to highlight the current gaps in the field of breast cancer therapeutics and areas which require further study.

Abstract: Over the past few decades, siRNA and miRNA have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers and clinicians. These molecules have been extensively studied from the standpoint of developing biopharmaceuticals against various diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and cancers. siRNA suppresses only a single target, whereas each miRNA regulates the expression of multiple target genes. More importantly, because miRNA are also secreted from cancer cells, and their aberrant expression is associated with tumor development and progression, they represent not only therapeutic targets but also promising biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, miRNA may be more effective tools against cancers, in which multiple signal pathways are dysregulated. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the development of miRNA therapeutics for the treatment of cancer patients, and describe delivery systems for oligonucleotide therapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: State of the art endocrine treatments for patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer in 2025.. Abstract: Endometrial cancer (EC) is rising in incidence, particularly in younger, premenopausal women, due to increasing rates of obesity and delayed childbearing. This review evaluates current and emerging endocrine therapies, with a focus on fertility-preserving approaches for early-stage EC and treatment options for advanced or recurrent disease. Fertility-sparing endocrine therapies, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices, achieve high response rates but carry recurrence risks. Biomarkers, including progesterone receptor status and molecular subtyping, are improving patient selection and outcomes. In advanced EC, single-agent and combination endocrine therapies with agents like selective estrogen receptor modulators, selective estrogen receptor down-regulators (SERDs), and aromatase inhibitors show efficacy, especially in hormone receptor-positive disease. Newer agents, including next-generation SERDs and proteolysis-targeting chimeras, hold potential for treating resistant cases. Endocrine therapy offers a well tolerated alternative to chemotherapy in selected EC patients, particularly those with hormone-sensitive tumors. Advances in molecular profiling and the development of novel endocrine agents are refining treatment strategies, supporting endocrine therapy's continued role in managing EC across various stages.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular correlates for HPV-negative head and neck cancer engraftment prognosticate patient outcomes.. Abstract: There is a pressing need to improve risk stratification and treatment selection for HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) due to the adverse side effects of treatment. One of the most important prognostic features is lymph nodes involvement. Previously, we demonstrated that tumor formation in patient-derived xenografts (i.e. engraftment) was associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with HPV-negative HNSCC. However, assessing engraftment is challenging in clinical settings. Here, we perform transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of 88 HNSCC patients and find the relationship between engraftment and clinical outcomes is recapitulated by molecular phenotype. We identify LAMC2 and TGM3 as candidate prognostic biomarkers and validated their utility in an independent cohort containing 404 HPV-negative HNSCC patients. Strikingly, these markers significantly improve prediction of outcomes beyond nodal status alone and can significantly stratify patients without any nodal involvement. Overall, our study demonstrates how the molecular characteristics of engraftment can inform patient prognostication. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: miR-149 as a Potential Molecular Target for Cancer.. Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are frequently dysregulated in cancers and serve as attractive targets for prognostication and therapeutic applications. Besides cancer, the biological functions of miR-149 have been studied in various diseases. This review aims to summarize the reports available in the literature, regarding miR-149 as a molecular target for cancer therapeutics. An extensive literature search was conducted using the Pubmed database to sieve out articles related to the roles of miR-149 in carcinogenesis and cancer progression, and potential miRNA-based therapies. A total of 89 publications were selected for inclusion in this review. Depending on the cancer type, miR-149 can behave either as a tumor suppressor or as an 'onco-miR' that promotes tumorigenesis and cancer spread, suggesting that this miRNA has diverse functions. Potential miRNA-based therapies include the use of miRNA mimics, miRNA inhibitors, demethylating agents and circular RNAs. Although targeting miRNA is an attractive anti-cancer strategy, not all cancers can be treated by the same miRNA-based strategy. A comprehensive understanding of miRNA regulatory mechanism is also necessary to improve the design of miRNA-based therapeutics and there is a need for safe and efficient delivery methods when using this approach for anti-cancer treatment.

Abstract: Activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) is a common subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is very likely to infiltrate the bone marrow. Over 30% of patients are converted to relapsed/refractory DLBCL after first-line rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone therapy, with a poor prognosis. Our aim was to identify molecular markers that might be utilized to predict relapsed/refractory ABC-DLBCL patients. Hence, we collected bone marrow aspirate smears from 202 patients with ABC-DLBCL and detected expression of bone marrow molecular marker proteins by immunocytochemistry. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)3, nuclear factor (NF)-<i>\u03ba</i>B p65, Syk, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and Bcl2 proteins were strongly expressed in bone marrow aspirate smears of ABC-DLBCL patients. The same smear could present positive expression of multiple proteins simultaneously. Positive combinations of protein expression were associated with resistance. The most significant finding was that the Stat3<sup>+</sup>NF-<i>\u03ba</i>B<sup>+</sup> group developed resistance, which was significantly higher than that of the Stat3<sup>-</sup>NF-<i>\u03ba</i>B<sup>-</sup>group (80 vs. 14%). There was a significant difference in two-year relapse-free survival between protein-positive and protein-negative combinations of Stat3-NF-<i>\u03ba</i>B (P = 0.005), Bcl2-Stat3 (P = 0.009), Bcl2-Pax5 (P = 0.003), and BTK-Syk (P < 0.001). Thus, we detected key molecules in multiple signaling pathways in bone marrow aspirate smears. At the same time, the results provide further clinical evidence of ABC-DLBCL drug-resistant molecules and provide a theoretical basis for rational second-line treatment after drug resistance.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Convergent epigenetic evolution drives relapse in acute myeloid leukemia.. Abstract: Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is highly aggressive and often treatment refractory. We analyzed previously published AML relapse cohorts and found that 40% of relapses occur without changes in driver mutations, suggesting that non-genetic mechanisms drive relapse in a large proportion of cases. We therefore characterized epigenetic patterns of AML relapse using 26 matched diagnosis-relapse samples with ATAC-seq. This analysis identified a relapse-specific chromatin accessibility signature for mutationally stable AML, suggesting that AML undergoes epigenetic evolution at relapse independent of mutational changes. Analysis of leukemia stem cell (LSC) chromatin changes at relapse indicated that this leukemic compartment underwent significantly less epigenetic evolution than non-LSCs, while epigenetic changes in non-LSCs reflected overall evolution of the bulk leukemia. Finally, we used single-cell ATAC-seq paired with mitochondrial sequencing (mtscATAC) to map clones from diagnosis into relapse along with their epigenetic features. We found that distinct mitochondrially-defined clones exhibit more similar chromatin accessibility at relapse relative to diagnosis, demonstrating convergent epigenetic evolution in relapsed AML. These results demonstrate that epigenetic evolution is a feature of relapsed AML and that convergent epigenetic evolution can occur following treatment with induction chemotherapy. Journal: eLife.

It is known that B.C. and other cancers have a very high rate of genetic heterogeneity and genomic mutations. Traditional oncology approaches have not been able to provide a lasting solution. Targeted therapeutics have been instrumental in handling the complexity and resistance associated with B.C. However, the progress of genomic technology has transformed our understanding of the genetic landscape of breast cancer, opening new avenues for improved anti-cancer therapeutics. Genomics is critical in developing tailored therapeutics and identifying patients most benefit from these treatments. The next generation of breast cancer clinical trials has incorporated next-generation sequencing technologies into the process, and we have seen benefits. These innovations have led to the approval of better-targeted therapies for patients with breast cancer. Genomics has a role to play in clinical trials, including genomic tests that have been approved, patient selection and prediction of therapeutic response. Multiple clinical trials in breast cancer have been done and are still ongoing, which have applied genomics technology. Precision medicine can be achieved in breast cancer therapy with increased efforts and advanced genomic studies in this domain. Genomics studies assist with patient outcomes improvement and oncology advancement by providing a deeper understanding of the biology behind breast cancer. This article will examine the present state of genomics in breast cancer clinical trials. Journal: Briefings in functional genomics. Year: 2024. Authors: Enoma D.

Abstract: Isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant gliomas are lethal brain cancers that impair quality of life in young adults. Although less aggressive than glioblastomas, IDH-mutant gliomas invariably progress to incurable disease with unpredictable recurrence. A better classification of patient risk of recurrence is needed. Here, we describe a multimodal analytical pipeline integrating imaging, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles using machine learning to improve patient stratification with novel signatures of patient risk of recurrence based on gene expression, protein level, and imaging. Additionally, we describe the biological characteristics of IDH-mutant glioma subtypes categorized by positron emission tomography (PET) and histology, and we reinforce the integration of positron emission tomography (PET) metrics in the classification of IDH-mutant gliomas. We identify a gene signature (KRT19, RUNX3, and SCRT2) and a protein signature (ATXN10, EIF4H, ITGAV, and NCAM1) associated with an increased risk of early recurrence. Furthermore, we integrated these markers with imaging-derived features, obtaining a better stratification of IDH-mutant glioma patients in comparison to histomolecular classification alone.

Targeted therapies have emerged as a promising treatment strategy for lung cancers. To evaluate the current landscape of targets and find promising targets for future new drug discovery for lung cancers, this research identified the science-technology-clinical development pattern and mapped the interaction network of targets. Targets for cancers were classified into 3 groups based on a paper published in Nature. We searched for scientific pieces of literature, patent documents and clinical trials of targets in Group 1 and Group 2 for lung cancers. Then, a target-target interaction network of Group 1 was constructed, and the science-technology-clinical (S-T-C) development patterns of targets in Group 1 were identified. Finally, based on the cluster distribution and the development pattern of targets in Group 1, interactions between the targets were employed to predict potential targets in Group 2 for drug development. The target-target interaction (TTI) network of group 1 resulted in 3 clusters with different developmental stages. The potential targets in Group 2 are divided into 3 ranks. Level-1 is the first priority and level-3 is the last. Level-1 includes 16 targets, such as STAT3, CRKL, and PTPN11, that are mostly involved in signaling transduction pathways. Level-2 and level-3 contain 8 and 6 targets, respectively, related to various biological functions. This study will provide references for drug development in lung cancers, emphasizing that priorities should be given to targets in Level-1, whose mechanisms are worth further exploration.

Abstract: Molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) provides sensitive detection and mapping of molecular targets. While cancer-associated fibroblasts and integrins have been proposed as targets for imaging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), herein, spatial transcriptomics and proteomics of human surgical samples are applied to select PDAC targets. We find that selected cancer cell\u00a0surface markers are spatially correlated and provide specific cancer localization, whereas the spatial correlation between cancer markers and immune-related or fibroblast markers is low. Claudin-4 expression increases ~16 fold in cancer as compared with normal pancreas, and tight junction localization confers low background for imaging in normal tissue. We develop a peptide-based molecular imaging agent targeted to claudin-4 with accumulation to ~25% injected activity per cubic centimeter (IA/cc) in metastases and ~18% IA/cc in tumors. Our work motivates a data-driven approach to selection of molecular targets. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2024. Authors: Wang J, Seo JW, Kare AJ, Schneider M, Pandrala M.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Prospects for combining targeted and conventional cancer therapy with immunotherapy.. Abstract: Over the past 25 years, research in cancer therapeutics has largely focused on two distinct lines of enquiry. In one approach, efforts to understand the underlying cell-autonomous, genetic drivers of tumorigenesis have led to the development of clinically important targeted agents that result in profound, but often not durable, tumour responses in genetically defined patient populations. In the second parallel approach, exploration of the mechanisms of protective tumour immunity has provided several therapeutic strategies - most notably the 'immune checkpoint' antibodies that reverse the negative regulators of T cell function - that accomplish durable clinical responses in subsets of patients with various tumour types. The integration of these potentially complementary research fields provides new opportunities to improve cancer treatments. Targeted and immune-based therapies have already transformed the standard-of-care for several malignancies. However, additional insights into the effects of targeted therapies, along with conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy, on the induction of antitumour immunity will help to advance the design of combination strategies that increase the rate of complete and durable clinical response in patients.

Abstract: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents about 15% to 20% of all breast cancers and is typically associated with poorer outcome than other breast cancer subtypes. The heterogeneity of this breast cancer subtype and present lack of clinically established targeted therapies further complicates treatment of patients. The treatment of TNBC emphasizes enhancing health care and developing personalized medicine. To respond to this need, the researchers have turned their attention to a different approach to scientific enquiry: the era of \"big biology\" and the integrative study of biological systems, also called \"Omics\" technologies. The term omics comprises different fields of molecular studies and characterizes a global view on biological molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites. Combined \"omics\" approach offers a major tool for the understanding of a challenging cancer model, TNBC. This review discusses the different discoveries made using omics technologies concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC phenotypic heterogeneity, and their potential transfer to clinical applications.

Abstract: Recent technological innovations have enabled the high-throughput quantification of gene expression and epigenetic regulation within individual cells, transforming our understanding of how complex tissues are constructed<sup>1-6</sup>. However, missing from these measurements is the ability to routinely and easily spatially localize these profiled cells. We developed a strategy, Slide-tags, in which single nuclei within an intact tissue section are tagged with spatial barcode oligonucleotides derived from DNA-barcoded beads with known positions. These tagged nuclei can then be used as an input into a wide variety of single-nucleus profiling assays. Application of Slide-tags to the mouse hippocampus positioned nuclei at less than 10\u2009\u03bcm spatial resolution and delivered whole-transcriptome data that are indistinguishable in quality from ordinary single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data. To demonstrate that Slide-tags can be applied to a wide variety of human tissues, we performed the assay on brain, tonsil and melanoma. We revealed cell-type-specific spatially varying gene expression across cortical layers and spatially contextualized receptor-ligand interactions driving B cell maturation in lymphoid tissue. A major benefit of Slide-tags is that it is easily adaptable to almost any single-cell measurement technology. As a proof of principle, we performed multiomic measurements of open chromatin, RNA and T cell\u00a0receptor (TCR) sequences in the same cells from metastatic melanoma, identifying transcription factor motifs driving cancer cell state transitions in spatially distinct microenvironments. Slide-tags offers a universal platform for importing the compendium of established single-cell measurements into the spatial genomics repertoire. Journal: Nature. Year: 2024.

Abstract: While immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) has revolutionized cancer treatment, most patients with advanced disease fail to achieve durable benefit. To address this challenge, it is essential to integrate mechanistic research with clinical studies to: (1) understand response mechanisms, (2) identify patient-specific resistance pathways, (3) develop biomarkers for patient selection, and (4) design novel therapies to overcome resistance. We propose that incorporating \"direct-in-patient\" studies into clinical trials is crucial for bridging the gap between fundamental science and clinical oncology. In this review, we first highlight recent clinical success of ICT in the neoadjuvant setting, where treatment is given in earlier disease stages to improve outcomes. We then explore how neoadjuvant clinical trials could be utilized to drive mechanistic laboratory-based investigations. Finally, we discuss novel scientific concepts that will potentially aid in overcoming resistance to ICT, which will require future clinical trials to understand their impact on human immune responses.

Abstract: There is some evidence from in vitro studies as well as case series that patients with documented platinum resistance will respond to platinum after a nonplatinum drug. In addition, retrospective case studies have demonstrated the difficulty in determining if delaying second platinum is detrimental or beneficial. For that reason, a prospective Italian randomized trial conducted by the Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian Cancer (MITO) Group (MITO-8), comparing nonplatinum with platinum-based therapy is being performed to assess the effects of delaying platinum on survival.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting of oncogenic signaling pathways by berberine for treatment of colorectal cancer.. Abstract: Studies indicate that inhibiting a single signaling pathway or one single product of a gene is insufficient for the prevention and treatment of cancer. This is due to the fact that dysregulation must occur in more than 500 genes in order to produce a cancerous phenotype. Despite this evidence, available drugs used for cancer treatment focus on a single target. Meanwhile, berberine as a nutraceutical is capable of targeting various processes involved in tumor development including proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In comparison with synthetic agents, berberine is cheaper, safer, and more available. Berberine has shown anti-inflammatory properties which make it an ideal option in order to prevent inflammation-associated cancers. Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers all over the world and its incidence is increasing each day. Therefore, further investigations about berberine could be helpful in the discovery of novel agents for preventing and/or treating colorectal cancer. This review emphasizes the studies investigating the roles of berberine in colorectal cancer such as controlling cell signaling pathways, inducing apoptosis, regulating microRNAs, attenuating oxidative stress, and affecting inflammation.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: RNA therapeutics in cancer treatment.. Abstract: RNA therapeutics are a class of drugs that use RNA molecules to treat diseases, including cancer. RNA therapeutics work by targeting specific genes or proteins involved in the disease process, with the aim of blocking or altering their activity to ultimately halt or reverse the disease progression. The use of RNA therapeutics in cancer treatment has shown great potential, as they offer the ability to specifically target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact. This is in contrast to traditional chemotherapy and radiation treatments, which can damage healthy cells and cause unpleasant side effects. The field of RNA therapeutics is rapidly advancing, with several types of RNA molecules being developed for cancer treatment, including small interfering RNA, microRNA, mRNA, and RNA aptamers. Each type of RNA molecule has unique properties and mechanisms of action, allowing for targeted and personalized cancer treatments. In this chapter, we will explore the different types of RNA therapeutics used in cancer treatment, their mechanisms of action, and their potential applications in treating different types of cancer. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities in the development and research of RNA therapeutics for cancer, as well as the future outlook for this promising field.

Abstract: Chemotherapy is a standard treatment for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which sometimes relapses with chemoresistant features. However, whether acquired drug-resistance mutations in relapsed ALL pre-exist or are induced by treatment remains unknown. Here we provide direct evidence of a specific mechanism by which chemotherapy induces drug-resistance-associated mutations leading to relapse. Using genomic and functional analysis of relapsed ALL we show that thiopurine treatment in mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient leukemias induces hotspot TP53 R248Q mutations through a specific mutational signature (thio-dMMR). Clonal evolution analysis reveals sequential MMR inactivation followed by TP53 mutation in some patients with ALL. Acquired TP53 R248Q mutations are associated with on-treatment relapse, poor treatment response and resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, which could be reversed by pharmacological p53 reactivation. Our findings indicate that TP53 R248Q in relapsed ALL originates through synergistic mutagenesis from thiopurine treatment and MMR deficiency and suggest strategies to prevent or treat TP53-mutant relapse.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Signal transduction therapy of cancer.. Abstract: Signal transduction therapy for cancer targets signaling elements with key roles in cancer cell survival and proliferation, but with more minor roles in the survival of healthy cells. Cancer cells have shrunken signaling networks, and therefore tend to be dependent on fewer signaling modules than non-cancerous cells. Thus, targeted therapy holds the promise of efficacy with minimal toxicity. Yet, with the notable exception of Gleevec for the treatment of early chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), targeted therapies have so far had minimal success. Unlike early CML, which is dependent upon BCR-ABL, most cancers are not dependent on a single survival factor. Furthermore, tumors are constantly evolving entities, and are heterogeneous in their cellular makeup, compounding the challenge. \"Smart cocktails\", comprising rational combinations of therapies, need to be developed to meet this challenge. What are the best pathways to target, and why? What types of molecules can be developed into effective therapeutics? What combinations are likely to be successful? Here we present an overview of the principles that need to be considered in designing effective targeted therapy for cancer. Journal: Molecular aspects of medicine. Year: 2010.

However, recent new effective treatment strategies have improved its outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the emerging therapeutics for TNBC, describing both previously approved therapies that are currently being repurposed, as well as new target therapies that may improve patient outcomes. Emerging therapies are forthcoming in TNBC's treatment landscape, including new post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategies, PARP inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates. Combination of different therapies such as AKT/PI3K/mTOR-inhibitors, other immunotherapeutic agents, CDK-inhibitors, antiandrogens, antiangiogenics, and histone deacetylase inhibitors is under clinical investigation. The treatment landscape for TNBC is gradually evolving towards a more personalized approach with promising expectations. Journal: Current oncology reports. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Comprehensive molecular profiling was used to define the genomic and immune landscapes of leiomyosarcomas (LMS) by anatomic subtypes, which have not been completely characterized. A total of 1,115 LMS samples, categorized into uterine LMS (uLMS), retroperitoneal LMS, or other LMS (oLMS), underwent DNA/RNA sequencing (Caris Life Sciences). Genomic/transcriptomic profiles were compared across subtypes. Immune profiling was compared with melanoma (n = 1,255), an immunogenic tumor. Insurance claims data were used to infer real-world outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in LMS. uLMSs (n = 701) were molecularly distinct from retroperitoneal LMSs (n = 166) and oLMSs (n = 248). RB1 mutations and MAP2K4 copy-number amplification were more common in non-uLMS. MED12 mutations were almost exclusive to uLMS. Traditional ICI response biomarkers (i.e., PD-L1) did not vary by anatomic site. Non-uLMS demonstrated upregulated immune-related gene sets, including IFN and inflammatory response pathways, and higher immune cell infiltration, especially CD8+ T cells and B cells (>2-fold increase, P < 0.0001). LMS had lower immune cell abundance and T cell-inflamed scores (TIS) compared with melanoma, though 11% of oLMS samples had high TIS scores. In a real-world cohort (n = 138), 29% of patients with LMS receiving ICI were treated >6 months, indicating potential clinical benefit. Comprehensive profiling suggested that uLMS represents a molecularly distinct disease from non-uLMS. Although traditional ICI response biomarkers were similar across anatomic subtypes, uLMSs were immune cold compared with non-uLMS. Signals for ICI responsiveness, such as high TIS and immune cell abundance, in some tumors suggest that further research into immunotherapies for LMS is warranted.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in breast cancer management, it remains the most common malignancy among women worldwide and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Therefore, there is considerable room for improvement in diagnostics, therapeutics, and research related to breast cancer. Although chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and targeted therapies for estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancers remain the standard treatments, numerous new therapeutic targets and treatment modalities are emerging. Since their discovery, nanobodies have attracted significant attention in biomedical science as research tools, diagnostic agents, and therapeutic molecules. While many studies have explored nanobodies, this mini review focuses on recent advancements in their application to breast cancer therapy. Specifically, we examine nanobody-based strategies for targeting uniquely expressed molecules in breast cancer, modulating immune responses, and facilitating nanobody-drug delivery systems, as well as how nanobodies can help overcome the limitations of current treatments. We also discuss the challenges hindering their rapid traslation into clinical practice. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Despite substantial therapeutic progress in recent decades, it continues to pose a major global health challenge. Therefore, translating novel therapeutic modalities from the laboratory to clinical settings is critically needed. Journal: The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics. Year: 2025.

Abstract: For most children who relapse with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the prognosis is poor, and there is a need for novel therapies to improve outcome. We screened samples from children with B-lineage ALL entered into the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 clinical trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov, #NCT00114348) for somatic mutations activating the Ras pathway (KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, and PTPN11) and showed mutation to be highly prevalent (76 from 206). Clinically, they were associated with high-risk features including early relapse, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and specifically for NRAS/KRAS mutations, chemoresistance. KRAS mutations were associated with a reduced overall survival. Mutation screening of the matched diagnostic samples found many to be wild type (WT); however, by using more sensitive allelic-specific assays, low-level mutated subpopulations were found in many cases, suggesting that they survived up-front therapy and subsequently emerged at relapse. Preclinical evaluation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) showed significant differential sensitivity in Ras pathway-mutated ALL compared with WT cells both in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft model engrafted with primary ALL; in the latter, reduced RAS-mutated CNS leukemia. Given these data, clinical evaluation of selumetinib may be warranted for Ras pathway-mutated relapsed ALL. Journal: Blood. Year: 2014. Authors: Irving J, Matheson E, Minto L, Blair H, Case M.

Abstract: Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Although surgery is the primary treatment, serious maladies that dissipate to other parts of the body may require chemotherapy. As there is no effective procedure to treat stomach cancer, natural small molecules are a current focus of research interest for the development of better therapeutics. Chemotherapy is usually used as a last resort for people with advanced stomach cancer. Anti-colon cancer chemotherapy has become increasingly effective due to drug resistance and sensitivity across a wide spectrum of drugs. Naturally-occurring substances have been widely acknowledged as an important project for discovering innovative medications, and many therapeutic pharmaceuticals are made from natural small molecules. Although the beneficial effects of natural products are as yet unknown, emerging data suggest that several natural small molecules could suppress the progression of stomach cancer. Therefore, the underlying mechanism of natural small molecules for pathways that are directly involved in the pathogenesis of cancerous diseases is reviewed in this article. Chemotherapy and molecularly-targeted drugs can provide hope to colon cancer patients. New discoveries could help in the fight against cancer, and future stomach cancer therapies will probably include molecularly formulated drugs. Journal: Molecules (Basel, Switzerland). Year: 2022.

Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequently diagnosed late and has poor survival. The two predominant subtypes of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), are currently differentially diagnosed using immunohistochemical markers; however, they are increasingly recognized as very different cancer types suggestive of potential for new, more targeted therapies. There are extensive efforts to find more precise and noninvasive differential diagnostic tools. Here, we examined these two NSCLC subtypes for differences that may inform treatment and identify potential novel therapeutic pathways. We presented a comparative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic expression in tumors from a cohort of 22 NSCLC patients: 8 LUSC and 14 LUAD. Comparing NSCLC subtypes, we found differential gene expression related to cell differentiation for LUSC and cellular structure and immune response regulation for LUAD. Differential protein expression between NSCLC subtypes was related to extracellular structure for LUSC and metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism for LUAD. This direct comparison was more informative about subtype-specific pathways than between each subtype and control (nontumor) tissues. Many of our observations between NSCLC subtypes support and inform existing observations and reveal differences that may aid research seeking to identify and validate novel subtype biomarkers or druggable targets.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Effects of HOX family regulator-mediated modification patterns and immunity characteristics on tumor-associated cell type in endometrial cancer.. Abstract: Endometrial cancer (UCEC) is one of three major malignant tumors in women. The HOX gene regulates tumor development. However, the potential roles of HOX in the expression mechanism of multiple cell types and in the development and progression of tumor microenvironment (TME) cell infiltration in UCEC remain unknown. In this study, we utilized both the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database to analyze transcriptome data of 529 patients with UCEC based on 39 HOX genes, combing clinical information, we discovered HOX gene were a pivotal factor in the development and progression of UCEC and in the formation of TME diversity and complexity. Here, a new scoring system was developed to quantify individual HOX patterns in UCEC. Our study found that patients in the low HOX score group had abundant anti-tumor immune cell infiltration, good tumor differentiation, and better prognoses. In contrast, a high HOX score was associated with blockade of immune checkpoints, which enhances the response to immunotherapy. The Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) exhibited a higher expression of the HOX gene in the tumor patients. We revealed that the significant upregulation of the HOX gene in the epithelial cells can activate signaling pathway associated with tumour invasion and metastasis through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), such as nucleotide metabolic proce and so on. Finally, a risk prognostic model established by the positive relationship between HOX scores and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can predict the prognosis of individual patients by scRNA-seq and transcriptome data sets. In sum, HOX gene may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prediction of UCEC and to develop more effective therapeutic strategies. Journal: Molecular biomedicine. Year: 2024.

An emerging field in cancer therapy utilizes extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are natural nanoparticles that are now recognized as key players in intercellular communication. With targeting potential and their inherent ability to transport molecules, EVs demonstrate great promise in the field of drug delivery. Targeted oncotherapy aims to hit the cancer's bull's eye while avoiding off-target effects associated with traditional treatment strategies. However, the dynamic nature of cancer cells limits the effectiveness of treatment based solely on cancer antigens. The tumour microenvironment is an important factor in cancer development and progression, providing yet another means to target. In this review, we discuss potential tumour microenvironment-associated antigens that have been tested in preclinical and clinical trials. We also discuss how EVs could be engineered to target these antigens in a multi-armed cancer therapy. Journal: Cancer letters. Year: 2025. Authors: Ilamathi HS, Rinaldo G, Wiklander OPB.

Abstract: Platinum-derived chemotherapy medications are often combined with other conventional therapies for treating different tumors, including colorectal cancer. However, the development of drug resistance and multiple adverse effects remain common in clinical settings. Thus, there is a necessity to find novel treatments and drug combinations that could effectively target colorectal cancer cells and lower the probability of disease relapse. To find potential synergistic interaction, we designed multiple different combinations between cisplatin, cannabidiol, and intermittent serum starvation on colorectal cancer cell lines. Based on the cell viability assay, we found that combinations between cannabidiol and intermittent serum starvation, cisplatin and intermittent serum starvation, as well as cisplatin, cannabidiol, and intermittent serum starvation can work in a synergistic fashion on different colorectal cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we analyzed differentially expressed genes and affected pathways in colorectal cancer cell lines to understand further the potential molecular mechanisms behind the treatments and their interactions. We found that synergistic interaction between cannabidiol and intermittent serum starvation can be related to changes in the transcription of genes responsible for cell metabolism and cancer's stress pathways. Moreover, when we added cisplatin to the treatments, there was a strong enrichment of genes taking part in G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Journal: International journal of molecular sciences.

Abstract: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are precursor lesions of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). IPMNs are generally associated with high risk of developing malignancy and therefore need to be diagnosed and assessed accurately, once detected. Existing diagnostic methods are inadequate, and identification of efficient biomarker capable of detecting high-risk IPMNs is necessitated. Moreover, the mechanism of development of malignancy in IPMNs is also elusive. Gene expression meta-analysis conducted using 12 low-risk IPMN and 23 high-risk IPMN tissue samples. We have also listed all the altered miRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), identified their target genes, and performed pathway analysis. We further enlisted cyst fluid proteins detected to be altered in high-risk or malignant IPMNs and compared them with fraction of differentially expressed genes secreted into cyst fluid. Our meta-analysis identified 270 upregulated and 161 downregulated genes characteristically altered in high-risk IPMNs. We further identified 61 miRNAs and 14 lncRNAs and their target genes and key pathways contributing towards understanding of the gene regulation during the progression of the disease. Most importantly, we have detected 12 genes altered significantly both in cystic lesions and cyst fluid. Our study reports, for the first time, a meta-analysis identifying key changes in gene expression between low-risk and high-risk IPMNs and also explains the regulatory aspect through construction of a miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA interaction network. The 12-gene-signature could function as potential biomarker in cyst fluid for detection of IPMN with a high risk of developing malignancy. Journal: BioMed research international. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major global health concern, characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates. CRC progression involves intricate molecular networks that remain incompletely understood. In this study, we conducted an integrative multi-omics analysis of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles from CRC tissues and matched normal adjacent tissues (NATs). Our analysis revealed 1,394 differentially expressed long non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 2,788 genes, 548 proteins, and 91 metabolites. A significant interaction network comprising 22 lncRNAs, 14 mRNAs/proteins, and 9 metabolites was identified, among which lncRNA 60967.1 emerged as a pivotal regulator. Functional validation demonstrated that lncRNA 60967.1 is markedly downregulated in CRC cell lines and patient tissues. Overexpression of lncRNA 60967.1 restored expression of the tumor suppressor PLCD4 and increased levels of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). This modulation enhanced IFN-\u03b3-induced apoptosis and increased expression of the IFN-\u03b3 receptor subunit IFNGR1, thereby partially reversing IFN-\u03b3 resistance. In murine models, lncRNA 60967.1 overexpression promoted immune cell infiltration and synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy to inhibit tumor growth. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel lncRNA-mRNA/protein-metabolite network, the lncRNA 60967.1-PLCD4-ATRA axis, that plays a critical role in CRC progression and immune modulation, offering promising therapeutic targets for improved treatment efficacy.

Although prognosis remains poor, technologies for improved molecular characterization along with the US Food and Drug Administration approval of several targeted therapies have changed the therapeutic landscape of advanced BTC. The hallmark of BTC oncogenesis is chronic inflammation of the liver and biliary tract regardless of the anatomical subtype. Subtypes of BTC correspond to distinct molecular characteristics, making BTC a molecularly heterogenous collection of tumors. Collectively, up to 40% of BTCs harbor a potentially targetable molecular abnormality, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend molecular profiling for all patients with advanced BTC. Use of circulating tumor DNA, immunohistochemistry, and next-generation sequencing continues to expand the utility for biomarker-driven management and molecular monitoring of BTC. Improving outcomes using biomarker-agnostic treatment for nontargetable tumors also remains a priority, and combinational treatment strategies such as immune checkpoint inhibition plus chemotherapy hold promise for this subgroup of patients.

Abstract: Tumor-agnostic US Food and Drug Administration approvals are transforming oncology. They include larotrectinib/entrectinib/repotrectinib (NTRK fusions), selpercatinib (RET fusions), dabrafenib/trametinib (BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutations), pembrolizumab/dostarlimab (microsatellite instability), pembrolizumab (high tumor mutational burden), and trastuzumab deruxtecan (HER2 3+ expression) (all solid cancers). Pemigatinib is approved for FGFR1-rearranged myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms. The genomically driven tissue-agnostic approach has a strong biological rationale (cancer is a disease of the genome), yields remarkably high response rates, and provides drug access to patients with an unmet need (rare/ultra-rare malignancies). Despite the solid tumor focus, both solid and hematologic cancers can harbor identical driver molecular abnormalities and respond to cognate therapies. For example, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and IDH1/2 mutations; ALK, FGFR, and NTRK fusions; PD-L1 amplification; and CD70 antigens are druggable in both solid and blood malignancies by gene-/immune-targeted therapies/chimeric antigen receptor T\u00a0cells.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Profile of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma mutations in Brazilian patients.. Abstract: Esophageal cancer is an aggressive tumor that has a high rate of incidence and mortality worldwide. It is the 10th most frequent type in Brazil, being squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) the predominant subtype. There is currently an incessant search to identify the frequently altered genes associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma biology that could be druggable. This study aimed to analyze the somatic mutation profile of a large panel of cancer-related genes in Brazilian ESCC. In a series of 46 ESCC diagnoses at Barretos Cancer Hospital, DNA isolated from paired fresh-frozen and blood tissue, a panel of 150 cancer-related genes was analyzed by next-generation sequencing. The genes with the highest frequency of mutations were TP53 (39/46, 84.8%), followed by NOTCH1 (7/46, 15.2%), NFE2L2 (5/46, 10.8%), RB1 (3/46, 6.5%), PTEN (3/46, 6.5%), CDKN2A (3/46, 6.5%), PTCH1 (2/46, 4.3%) and PIK3CA (2/46, 4.3%). There was no significant association between molecular and patients' clinicopathological features. Applying an evolutionary action score of p53 (EAp53), we observed that 14 (35.9%) TP53 mutations were classified as high-risk, yet no association with overall survival was observed. Concluding, this the largest mutation profile of Brazilian ESCC patients, which helps in the elucidation of the major cancer-related genes in this population. Journal: Scientific reports. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of highly effective chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains a challenging clinical problem associated with poor overall survival (OS). The traditional definition, which includes those patients with no response or relapse within 6 months of fludarabine, is evolving with the recognition that even patients with longer remissions of up to several years after CIT have poor subsequent treatment response and survival. Approved therapeutic options for these patients remain limited, and the goal of therapy for physically fit patients is often to achieve adequate cytoreduction to proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Fortunately, several novel targeted therapeutics in clinical trials hold promise of significant benefit for this patient population. This review discusses the activity of available and novel therapeutics in fludarabine-refractory or fludarabine-resistant CLL as well as recently updated data on alloSCT in CLL. Journal: Hematology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) involvement in epithelial-derived cancers and its current antibody-based immunotherapies.. Abstract: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the family of tyrosine kinase receptors. The binding of EGFR to its cognate ligands leads to its autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of the signal transduction pathways involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Accordingly, this receptor carries out both redundant and restricted functions in the germline development of mammals and in the maintenance of various adult tissues. Correspondingly, the loss of EGFR regulation results in many human diseases, with the most notable cancer. This receptor is overexpressed and/or mutated in multiple epithelial-derived tumors, and associated with poor prognosis and survival in cancer patients. Here, we discuss in detail the role of EGFR in specific epithelial-derived cancer pathologies; these include lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and squamous cell carcinomas. The development of multiple anticancer agents against EGFR diminished the progression and metastasis of tumors. Some of the most versatile therapeutic anti-EGFR agents include the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), demonstrating success in clinical settings when used in combination with cytotoxic treatments, such as chemotherapy and/or radiation. We thus discuss the development and application of two of the most notable therapeutic mAbs, cetuximab, and panitumumab, currently utilized in various EGFR-related epithelial cancers.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Comprehensive Molecular Characterization Reveals Genomic and Transcriptomic Subtypes of Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma.. Abstract: Recent molecular characterization of primary urothelial carcinoma (UC) may guide future clinical decision-making. For metastatic UC (mUC), a comprehensive molecular characterization is still lacking. We analyzed whole-genome DNA and RNA sequencing data for fresh-frozen metastatic tumor biopsies from 116 mUC patients who were scheduled for palliative systemic treatment within the context of a clinical trial (NCT01855477 and NCT02925234). Hierarchical clustering for mutational signatures revealed two major genomic subtypes: GenS1 (67%), which was APOBEC-driven; and GenS2 (24%), which had a high fraction of de novo mutational signatures related to reactive oxygen species and is putatively clock-like. Significantly mutated genes (SMGs) did not differ between the genomic subtypes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed five mUC subtypes: luminal-a and luminal-b (40%), stroma-rich (24%), basal/squamous (23%), and a nonspecified subtype (12%). These subtypes differed regarding expression of key genes, SMGs, oncogenic pathway activity, and immune cell infiltration. We integrated the genomic and transcriptomic data to propose potential therapeutic options by transcriptomic subtype and for individual patients. This in-depth analysis of a large cohort of patients with mUC may serve as a reference for subtype-oriented and patient-specific research on the etiology of mUC and for novel drug development. PATIENT SUMMARY: We carried out an in-depth analysis of the molecular and genetic features of metastatic cancer involving the cells that line the urinary tract. We showed that this is a heterogeneous disease with different molecular subtypes and we identified possible targets for therapy for each subtype. Journal: European urology. Year: 2022.

Abstract: In cancerous cells, significant changes occur in the activity of signaling pathways affecting a wide range of cellular activities ranging from growth and proliferation to apoptosis, invasiveness, and metastasis. Extensive changes also happen with respect to the metabolism of a cancerous cell encompassing a wide range of functions that include: nutrient\u00a0acquisition, biosynthesis of macromolecules, and energy generation. These changes are important and some therapeutic approaches for treating cancers have focused on targeting the metabolism of cancerous cells. Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have a significant effect on the metabolism of cells. There appears to be a close interaction between metabolism and the signaling pathways in a cancerous cell, in which the interaction provides the metabolic needs of a cancerous cell for uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and metastasis. In this review, we have reviewed the latest findings in this regard and briefly review the most recent research findings regarding targeting the metabolism of cancer cells as a therapeutic approach for treatment of cancer.

This chapter also explores the mechanisms of glycosylation that may lead to powerful translational therapeutic tools, such as glycotransferase inhibitors, glycan/glycopeptide-based vaccines, and antibody-based immunotherapies, all of which have shown great promise clinically in the field of immuno-oncology.

Abstract: Natural products with polypharmacological profiles have demonstrated promise as novel therapeutics for various complex diseases, including cancer. Currently, many gaps exist in our knowledge of which compounds interact with which targets, and experimentally testing all possible interactions is infeasible. Recent advances and developments of systems pharmacology and computational (in silico) approaches provide powerful tools for exploring the polypharmacological profiles of natural products. In this review, we introduce recent progresses and advances of computational tools and systems pharmacology approaches for identifying drug targets of natural products by focusing on the development of targeted cancer therapy. We survey the polypharmacological and systems immunology profiles of five representative natural products that are being considered as cancer therapies. We summarize various chemoinformatics, bioinformatics and systems biology resources for reconstructing drug-target networks of natural products. We then review currently available computational approaches and tools for prediction of drug-target interactions by focusing on five domains: target-based, ligand-based, chemogenomics-based, network-based and omics-based systems biology approaches. In addition, we describe a practical example of the application of systems pharmacology approaches by integrating the polypharmacology of natural products and large-scale cancer genomics data for the development of precision oncology under the systems biology framework. Finally, we highlight the promise of cancer immunotherapies and combination therapies that target tumor ecosystems (e.g. clones or 'selfish' sub-clones) via exploiting the immunological and inflammatory 'side' effects of natural products in the cancer post-genomics era.

Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health burden due to its high mortality rate and frequent diagnosis at advanced stages. This study aimed to identify reliable diagnostic biomarkers and elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying GC by integrating transcriptomic data from independent platforms and applying machine learning techniques. Two transcriptomic datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus were analyzed: GSE26899 (microarray, <i>n</i> = 108) as the discovery dataset and GSE248612 (RNA-seq, <i>n</i> = 12) for validation. Differential expression analysis was conducted using limma and DESeq2, selecting genes with |log2FC| > 1 and adjusted <i>p</i> < 0.05. The top 200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were used to develop machine learning models (random forest, logistic regression, neural networks). Functional enrichment analyses (GO, KEGG, Hallmark) were applied to explore relevant biological pathways. In GSE26899, 627 DEGs were identified (201 upregulated, 426 downregulated), with key genes including <i>CST1</i>, <i>KIAA1199</i>, <i>TIMP1</i>, <i>MSLN</i>, and <i>ATP4A</i>. The random forest model demonstrated excellent classification performance (AUC = 0.952). GSE248612 validation yielded 738 DEGs. Cross-platform comparison confirmed 55.6% concordance among core genes, highlighting <i>CST1</i>, <i>TIMP1</i>, <i>KRT17</i>, <i>ATP4A</i>, <i>CHIA</i>, <i>KRT16</i>, and <i>CRABP2</i>. Enrichment analyses revealed involvement in ECM-receptor interaction, <i>PI3K-Akt</i> signaling, EMT, and cell cycle. This integrative transcriptomic and machine learning framework effectively identified high-confidence biomarkers for GC. Notably, <i>CST1</i>, <i>TIMP1</i>, <i>KRT16</i>, and <i>ATP4A</i> emerged as consistent, biologically relevant candidates with strong diagnostic performance and potential clinical utility. These findings may aid early detection strategies and guide future therapeutic developments in gastric cancer. Journal: Genes. Year: 2025. Authors: Balikci Cicek I, Kucukakcali Z.

Monoclonal antibodies, immune adjuvants, and vaccines against oncogenic viruses are now well-established cancer therapies. Immune modulation is a principal element of supportive care for many high-dose chemotherapy regimens. In addition, immune activation is now appreciated as central to the therapeutic mechanism of bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Advances in our understanding of the molecular interactions between tumors and the immune system have led to many novel investigational therapies and continue to inform efforts for devising more potent therapeutics. Novel approaches to immune-based cancer treatment strive to augment antitumor immune responses by expanding tumor-reactive T cells, providing exogenous immune-activating stimuli, and antagonizing regulatory pathways that induce immune tolerance. The future of immune therapy for cancer is likely to combine many of these approaches to generate more effective treatments. Journal: Annual review of immunology. Year: 2009.

Abstract: Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) is a lethal cancer, with limited therapeutic options. Large-scale studies in early settings provided critical insights into the genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of non-metastatic UC. The genomic landscape of mUC remains however unclear. Using Whole Exome (WES) and mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performed on metastatic biopsies from 111 patients, we show that driver genomic alterations from mUC were comparable to primary UC (TCGA data). APOBEC, platin, and HRD mutational signatures are the most prevalent in mUC, identified in 56%, 14%, and 9% of mUC samples, respectively. Molecular subtyping using consensus transcriptomic classification in mUC shows enrichment in neuroendocrine subtype. Paired samples analysis reveals subtype heterogeneity and temporal evolution. We identify potential therapeutic targets in 73% of mUC patients, of which FGFR3 (26%), ERBB2 (7%), TSC1 (7%), and PIK3CA (13%) are the most common. NECTIN4 and TACSTD2 are highly expressed regardless of molecular subtypes, FGFR3 alterations and sites of metastases. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Joint imputation and deconvolution of gene expression across spatial transcriptomics platforms.. Abstract: Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies measure gene expression across thousands of spatial locations within a tissue slice. Multiple SRT technologies are currently available and others are in active development, with each technology having varying spatial resolution (subcellular, single-cell, or multicellular regions), gene coverage (targeted vs. whole-transcriptome), and sequencing depth per location. For example, the widely used 10x Genomics Visium platform measures whole transcriptomes from multiple-cell-sized spots, whereas the 10x Genomics Xenium platform measures a few hundred genes at subcellular resolution. A number of studies apply multiple SRT technologies to slices that originate from the same biological tissue. Integration of data from different SRT technologies can overcome limitations of the individual technologies, enabling the imputation of expression from unmeasured genes in targeted technologies and/or the deconvolution of admixed expression from technologies with lower spatial resolution. Here, we introduce Spatial Integration for Imputation and Deconvolution (SIID), an algorithm to reconstruct a latent spatial gene expression matrix from a pair of observations from different SRT technologies. SIID leverages a spatial alignment and uses a joint nonnegative factorization model to accurately impute missing gene expression and infer gene expression signatures of cell types from admixed SRT data. In simulations involving paired SRT data sets from different technologies (e.g., Xenium and Visium), SIID shows superior performance in reconstructing spot-to-cell-type assignments, recovering cell type-specific gene expression and imputing missing data compared to contemporary tools. When applied to real-world 10x Xenium-Visium pairs from human breast and colon cancer tissues, SIID achieves highest performance in imputing holdout gene expression. Journal: Genome research.

Abstract: Since allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) represents an intensive curative treatment for high-risk malignancies, its failure to prevent relapse leaves few options for successful salvage treatment. While many patients have a high early mortality from relapse, some respond and have sustained remissions, and a minority has a second chance of cure with appropriate therapy. The prognosis for relapsed hematological malignancies after SCT depends on four factors: the time elapsed from SCT to relapse (with relapses occurring within 6 months having the worst prognosis), the disease type (with chronic leukemias and some lymphomas having a second possibility of cure with further treatment), the disease burden and site of relapse (with better treatment success if disease is treated early), and the conditions of the first transplant (with superior outcome for patients where there is an opportunity to increase either the alloimmune effect, the specificity of the antileukemia effect with targeted agents or the intensity of the conditioning in a second transplant). These features direct treatments toward either modified second transplants, chemotherapy, targeted antileukemia therapy, immunotherapy or palliative care. Journal: Expert review of hematology.

Abstract: Life expectancy in patients with multiple myeloma is increasing because of the availability of an increasing number of novel agents with various mechanisms of action against the disease. However, the disease remains incurable in most patients because of the emergence of resistant clones, leading to repeated relapses of the disease. In 2015, 5 novel agents were approved for therapy for relapsed multiple myeloma. This surfeit of novel agents renders management of relapsed multiple myeloma more complex because of the occurrence of multiple relapses, the risk of cumulative and emergent toxicity from previous therapies, as well as evolution of the disease during therapy. A group of physicians at Mayo Clinic with expertise in the care of patients with multiple myeloma regularly evaluates the evolving literature on the biology and therapy for multiple myeloma and issues guidelines on the optimal care of patients with this disease. In this article, the latest recommendations on the diagnostic evaluation of relapsed multiple myeloma and decision trees on how to treat patients at various stages of their relapse (off study) are provided together with the evidence to support them.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Expanding therapeutic targets in bladder cancer: the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.. Abstract: A complex equilibrium of biological signals exists within the human body to regulate normal cellular function and growth. Unfortunately, there are various ways in which disruption of these signaling pathways can result in uncontrollable cell growth--an important element in oncogenesis. In particular, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway appears to play a central role in the development of multiple cancers, including urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC). Although often called 'a master regulator,' mTOR is but one signal in an intricate signaling cascade that controls cell growth and angiogenesis in both normal and cancerous conditions. Other important factors in this pathway include upstream activators such as phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and Akt, negative regulators such as the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1/2, and downstream effectors such as p70 S6 kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E. On the basis of its important role in tumor growth, efforts have focused on developing means to effectively target the mTOR pathway in hopes of designing new treatments for various tumor types. To address the role of mTOR pathway activity in UCC, we will first review the basic elements of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and then apply this pathway to bladder cancer oncogenesis. As will be evident, significant progress has been made in defining the role of this pathway in UCC; however, continued research into the nuances of pathway regulation and the usage of targeted inhibition in bladder cancer patients is necessary to define mTOR as a promising target in this disease.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Gene Expression Signatures for Head and Neck Cancer Patient Stratification: Are Results Ready for Clinical Application?. Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth leading cancer by incidence worldwide and considering the recent EUROCARE-5 population-based study the 5-year survival rate of HNSCC patients in Europe ranges between 69% in localized cases and 34% in patients with regional involvement. The development of high-throughput gene expression assays in the last two decades has provided the invaluable opportunity to improve our knowledge on cancer biology and to identify predictive signatures in the most deeply analyzed malignancies, such as hematological and breast cancers. At variance, till 2010, the number of reliable reports referring gene expression data related to HSNCC biology and prediction was quite limited. A critical revision of the literature reporting gene expression data in HNSCC indicated that in the last 6\u00a0years, there were new important studies with a relevant increase in the sample size and a more accurate selection of cases, the publication of a growing number of studies applying a computational integration (meta-analysis) of different microarray datasets addressing similar clinical/biological questions, the increased use of molecular sub-classification of tumors according to their gene expression, and the release of the publicly available largest dataset in HNSCC by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Overall, also for this disease, it become evident that the expression analysis of the entire transcriptome has been enabling to achieve the identification of promising molecular signatures for (i) disclosure of the biology behind carcinogenesis with special focus on the HPV-related one, (ii) prediction of tumor recurrence or metastasis development, (iii) identification of subgroups of tumors with different biology and associated prognosis, and (iv) prediction of outcome and/or response to therapy. The increasing awareness of the relevance of strict collaboration among clinicians and translational researchers would in a near future enable the application of a personalized HNSCCs patients' treatment in the clinical practice based also on gene expression signatures.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of follow-up tests and examinations in diagnosing symptomatic and asymptomatic relapses after treatment for cervical cancer. Data were collected from medical records for all patients diagnosed as having cervical cancer from January 1985 to June 2010. The significance level was P < 0.005. Sixty-four (17.8%) of the 358 patients investigated suffered tumor relapse. Thirty-four (53.1%) were symptomatic, and 30 (46.9%) were asymptomatic. Most patients had tumor relapse diagnosed during physical examination, both among the symptomatic patients (50%) and the asymptomatic patients (66.7%) (P = 0.27). Cytopathology was responsible for detecting relapse in only 1 case in each group, corresponding to 2.9% and 3.3%, respectively (P = 0.99). Imaging examinations confirmed 10 relapses (29.4%) among symptomatic patients and 8 cases (26.6%) among asymptomatic patients (P = 0.77). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups or between the different methods of detecting relapses. There was still no association after adjustment for potential confounding factors such as age and type of treatment. Physical examination was the preeminent method for detecting tumor relapse in this study. None of the other tests or examinations were capable of detecting relapses in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. These results highlight the urgent need for prospective studies that compare the efficacy of different follow-up regimens, analyzing factors such as global survival, quality of life, and cost.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: How I treat relapsed myeloma.. Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy leading to significant life-expectancy shortening. Although the incorporation of the novel agents thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide in the front-line therapy has resulted in significant improvement, almost all patients relapse, making the treatment of relapse a real challenge. In the present article, when and how to treat relapsed MM is discussed. Treatment can be safely delayed in a subset of patients with asymptomatic relapse, whereas those with symptomatic relapse, advanced disease at diagnosis, or significant paraproteinemic increase require prompt rescue therapy. The benefit of retreatment and the use of a sequential approach for successive relapses considering drug synergism are highlighted. For patients with aggressive relapses and for those who have exhausted all available options, continued therapy until disease progression is recommended, particularly when using regimens with a long-term safety profile. Patients with a duration response to a first autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) longer than 2 years may benefit from a second ASCT. Patients with aggressive disease and/or poor cytogenetics at diagnosis relapsing within the first 2 years from ASCT should be considered for an allogeneic transplantation. Finally, a number of newer promising drugs are being actively investigated and the enrolment of patients in clinical trials is encouraged. Journal: Blood. Year: 2015.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cytoreductive surgery is feasible in patients with limited regional platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.. Abstract: To evaluate the efficacy of cytoreductive surgery versus chemotherapy for the treatment of limited regional, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). The clinical records of all patients with PROC treated in our center between March 2015 and March 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. We compared the oncology outcomes of patients who received cytoreduction or chemotherapy alone at relapse and presented information about postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Among 52 patients with limited regional recurrence, 40.4% (21/52) underwent cytoreduction because of platinum resistance, and 59.6% (31/52) received chemotherapy alone. No residual disease (R0) was achieved in 20 patients (95.2%). The severe morbidity rate within 30\u00a0days after the surgery was 15%. The median follow-up was 70.6\u00a0months. Compared with the chemotherapy alone group, the surgery group with R0 had better progression-free survival (PFS) (10.6 vs. 5.1\u00a0months; hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a00.421; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0035) and post-relapse survival (PRS) (32.6 vs. 16.3\u00a0months; HR\u00a0=\u00a00.478; P\u00a0=\u00a00.047), but there was no difference in overall survival (OS) between the two groups. Laparoscopy is associated with lesser intraoperative blood loss with no differences in survival and postoperative complications compared to the open approach (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0042). Subgroup survival analysis showed that compared with chemotherapy alone, surgery prolonged PFS in patients regardless of tumor size (greater than or equal to 4\u00a0cm or less). Surgery group patients who achieved R0 had an objective response rate (ORR) of 36.8% (7/19), among whom 40% (4/10) received platinum rechallenge chemotherapy and 33.3% (3/9) were administered non-platinum chemotherapy. When well-selected PROC patients with limited regional recurrence achieved R0, their outcomes were superior to those of patients who received only chemotherapy with an acceptable morbidity rate. Laparoscope technology could be a reliable alternative surgical approach. The reintroduction of platinum agents may be considered following surgery. Further analyses in a larger population are warranted to elucidate the risks and benefits of this surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy strategy. Journal: World journal of surgical oncology. Year: 2023.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting the Wnt pathway in cancer: the emerging role of Dickkopf-3.. Abstract: Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is a major trait of many human cancers. Due to its vast implications in tumorigenesis and progression, the Wnt pathway has attracted considerable attention at several molecular levels, also with respect to developing novel cancer therapeutics. Indeed, research in Wnt biology has recently provided numerous clues, and evidence is accumulating that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-related protein 3 (Dkk-3) and its regulators may constitute interesting therapeutic targets in the most important human cancers. Based on the currently available literature, we here review the knowledge on the biological role of Dkk-3 as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway, the involvement of Dkk-3 in several stages of tumor development, the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms disrupting DKK3 gene function in cancerous cells, and the potential clinical value of Dkk-3 expression/DKK3 promoter methylation as a biomarker and molecular target in cancer diseases. In conclusion, Dkk-3 rapidly emerges as a key player in human cancer with auspicious tumor suppressive capacities, most of all affecting apoptosis and proliferation. Its gene expression is frequently downregulated by promoter methylation in almost any solid and hematological tumor entity. Clinically, evidence is accumulating of Dkk-3 being both a potential tumor biomarker and effective anti-cancer agent. Although further research is needed, re-establishing Dkk-3 expression in cancer cells holds promise as novel targeted molecular tumor therapy. Journal: Biochimica et biophysica acta. Year: 2012.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Therapeutic targeting of the p53 pathway in cancer stem cells.. Abstract: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a high profile drug target for cancer therapeutics due to their indispensable role in cancer progression, maintenance and therapeutic resistance. Restoring wild-type (WT) p53 function is an attractive new therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer due to the well-described powerful tumor suppressor function of p53. As emerging evidence intimately links p53 and stem cell biology, this approach also provides an opportunity to target CSCs. This review covers the therapeutic approaches to restore the function of WT p53, cancer and normal stem cell biology in relation to p53 and the downstream effects of p53 on CSCs. The restoration of WT p53 function by targeting p53 directly, its interacting proteins or its family members holds promise as a new class of cancer therapies. This review examines the impact that such therapies may have on normal and CSCs based on the current evidence linking p53 signaling with these populations.

Abstract: Advances in cancer genomics have been propelled by the steady evolution of molecular profiling technologies. Over the past decade, high-throughput sequencing technologies have matured to the point necessary to support disease-specific shotgun sequencing. This has compelled whole-genome sequencing studies across a broad panel of malignancies. The emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies has inspired new chemical and computational techniques enabling interrogation of cancer-specific genomic and transcriptomic variants, previously unannotated genes, and chromatin structure. Finally, recent progress in single-cell sequencing holds great promise for studies interrogating the consequences of tumor evolution in cancers presenting with genomic heterogeneity.

Abstract: Patients with refractory or early relapsed anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) have a poor chance of survival. We report 20 children and adolescents with high-risk relapsed or refractory ALCL who underwent allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We retrospectively analysed 20 patients who relapsed between December 1991 and April 2003 during (six patients) or soon after first-line Berlin-Frankfurt-M\u00fcnster-type chemotherapy (14 patients) and underwent allogeneic HSCT. Nine patients received allogeneic HSCT after the first relapse and 11 after multiple relapses. Eight patients received their transplants from matched sibling donors, eight from unrelated donors and four from haploidentical family donors. The conditioning regimen was based on total body irradiation in 15 patients. Two patients relapsed after allogeneic HSCT and died. Three patients died of transplant-related toxicity. Event-free survival at 3 years after allogeneic transplant was 75 +/- 10%. There was no influence of donor type or conditioning regimen on outcome. Two of six patients with progressive disease during frontline therapy survived compared with 13/14 patients with a first relapse after frontline therapy. Two of three patients who were transplanted with active lymphoma and all five patients who received allogeneic HSCT for relapse following autologous HSCT survived disease-free. Allogeneic HSCT is effective and has acceptable toxicity as rescue therapy for high-risk ALCL relapse. It even offers cure for patients refractory to chemotherapy, suggesting a graft-versus-ALCL effect. Journal: British journal of haematology. Year: 2006.

Abstract: Prostate cancer poses a significant risk to the well-being and way of life of countless men, with an increased likelihood of relapse recorded following modern treatment. This highlights the need for innovative approaches, specifically targeting LGR5. This systematic review aims to establish a connection between LGR5 and the various signaling pathways involved in the progression of prostate cancer. LGR5, a gene targeted by Wnt signaling, encodes a receptor protein that serves as a prognostic biomarker for stem cells and indicates the presence of cancer stem cells in colorectal and gastrointestinal cancers. The functions of LGR5 include processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and signaling pathways. Any modifications to the LGR5 gene, whether caused by mutations or mechanical stimuli, can lead to the development of treatment-resistant stem cell cancers. This review examines the molecular mechanisms associated with LGR5 and emphasizes methodologies aimed at targeting LGR5 to enhance understanding and promote the development of LGR5-specific therapies.

Abstract: The therapeutic efficacy of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most prevalent histological subtype of primary lung cancer, remains inadequate, with accurate prognostic assessment posing significant challenges. This study sought to elucidate the prognostic significance of mitochondrial-related genes in LUAD through an integrative multi-omics approach, aimed at developing personalized therapeutic strategies. Utilizing transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, alongside clinical information from publicly available databases, we first applied dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to the LUAD single-cell dataset, focusing on the subclassification of fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and T cells. Mitochondrial-related prognostic genes were subsequently identified using TCGA-LUAD data, and LUAD cases were stratified into distinct molecular subtypes through consensus clustering, allowing for the exploration of gene expression profiles and clinical feature distributions across subtypes. By leveraging an ensemble of machine learning algorithms, we developed an Artificial Intelligence-Derived Prognostic Signature (AIDPS) model based on mitochondrial-related genes and validated its prognostic accuracy across multiple independent datasets. The AIDPS model demonstrated robust predictive power for LUAD patient outcomes, revealing significant differences in responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as survival outcomes between risk groups. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive analyses of tumor mutation burden (TMB), immune microenvironment characteristics, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, providing additional insights into the mechanistic roles of mitochondrial-related genes in LUAD pathogenesis. This study not only offers a novel approach to improving prognostic assessments in LUAD but also establishes a strong foundation for the development of personalized therapeutic interventions.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Prospects on strategies for therapeutically targeting oncogenic regulatory factors by small-molecule agents.. Abstract: Although the Human Genome Project has raised much hope for the identification of druggable genetic targets for cancer and other diseases, this genetic target-based approach has not improved productivity in drug discovery over the traditional approach. Analyses of known human target proteins of currently marketed drugs reveal that these drugs target only a limited number of proteins as compared to the whole proteome. In contrast to genome-based targets, mechanistic targets are derived from empirical research, at cellular or molecular levels, in disease models and/or in patients, thereby enabling the exploration of a greater number of druggable targets beyond the genome and epigenome. The paradigm shift has made a tremendous headway in developing new therapeutic agents targeting different clinically relevant mechanisms/pathways in cancer cells. In this Prospects article, we provide an overview of potential drug targets related to the following four emerging areas: (1) tumor metabolism (the Warburg effect), (2) dysregulated protein turnover (E3 ubiquitin ligases), (3) protein-protein interactions, and (4) unique DNA high-order structures and protein-DNA interactions. Nonetheless, considering the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneities that characterize cancer cells, the development of drug resistance in cancer cells by adapting signaling circuitry to take advantage of redundant pathways or feedback/crosstalk systems is possible. This \"phenotypic adaptation\" underlies the rationale of using therapeutic combinations of these targeted agents with cytotoxic drugs. Journal: Journal of cellular biochemistry. Year: 2014.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Survival after recurrence of osteosarcoma: a 20-year experience at a single institution.. Abstract: Approximately one-third of patients with osteosarcoma who have a complete response to their initial treatment can be expected to relapse. It is important to define what host, tumor, or treatment characteristics determine outcome after relapse. We present findings in 59 patients treated at our institution from 1974 to 1996 who have relapsed one or more times after their initial response. Host and tumor characteristics at diagnosis and relapse, therapeutic interventions and survival outcomes were determined from examination of medical records and a follow-up questionnaire. Of the 59 patients, 37 initially presented with localized disease of the extremity, 11 with localized non-extremity disease, and 11 with metastatic disease. This report focuses on those with localized disease of the extremity. For these patients, median time from original diagnosis to first recurrence was 14 months. Median survival after first recurrence was 31 months. The median post initial relapse survival was the same for patients whose first relapse occurred before or after 14 months from original diagnosis. Seventeen of 29 patients with systemic metastasis at first recurrence had complete removal of their disease and had a median post-op survival of 2.5 years, while the remaining 12 patients with no surgery, had a median survival of 2 years. Of the 37 patients who presented with primary disease only in the extremities and relapsed: 31 died (2 more than 6 years from first recurrence) and 6 are alive from 6 to 24 years from first recurrence (5 without disease and 1 with disease). Three of the five disease-free survivors had three or more relapses. With a long follow-up time, we found 15% of patients with relapsed osteosarcoma who originally presented with localized disease in the extremity are alive with no evidence of disease at 10 years from first recurrence (Kaplan-Meier estimate). Even patients with multiple relapses may have long-term disease-free survival after salvage therapy. Chemotherapy and time to first recurrence were unrelated to survival after relapse in this study. Complete surgical removal of metastatic disease may be important for long-term survival. Journal: Pediatric blood & cancer. Year: 2006.

Abstract: The liver is an immune-tolerant organ, allowing for organ transplantation with less immune suppression compared with other organs. It also provides fertile soil for tumor metastases, which tend to be more resistant to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy than metastases in other organs. This resistance may result from the sum of incremental evolutionary adaptions in various cell types to prevent overaction to antigens absorbed from the gut into the portal circulation or it might involve a central mechanism. Here, we propose that metabolism of vitamin A, which is highly concentrated in the liver, is a root source of tolerance and resistance of hepatic metastases to checkpoint blockade. Suppression of retinoic acid synthesis from vitamin A with disulfiram may mitigate tolerance and produce enhanced immunotherapy treatment results for patients with liver metastases.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Combined transcriptome and proteome analysis reveals MSN and ARFIP2 as biomarkers for trastuzumab resistance of breast cancer.. Abstract: HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) accounts for 20-30% of all BC subtypes and is linked to poor prognosis. Trastuzumab (Tz), a humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, is a first-line treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer which faces resistance challenges. This study aimed to identify the biomarkers driving trastuzumab resistance. Differential expression analysis of genes and proteins between trastuzumab-sensitive (TS) and trastuzumab-resistant (TR) cells was conducted using RNA-seq and iTRAQ. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) were used to study their functions. The prognostic significance and protein levels of ARFIP2 and MSN were evaluated using online tools and immunohistochemistry. Sensitivity of MSN and ARFIP2 to other therapies was assessed using public pharmacogenomics databases and the R language. Five genes were up-regulated, and nine genes were down-regulated in TR cells at both transcriptional and protein levels. Low ARFIP2 and high MSN expression linked to poor BC prognosis. MSN increased and ARFIP2 decreased in TR patients, correlating with shorter OS. MSN negatively impacted fulvestrant and immunotherapy sensitivity, while ARFIP2 had a positive impact. Our findings suggest that MSN and ARFIP2 could serve as promising biomarkers for predicting response to Tz, offering valuable insights for future research in the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic targets for BC patients with Tz resistance.

Abstract: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are used in combination chemotherapies as front-line treatment for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Although effective, many patients relapse and become resistant to chemotherapy and GCs in particular. Why these patients relapse is not clear. We took a comprehensive, functional genomics approach to identify sources of GC resistance. A genome-wide shRNA screen identified the transcriptional coactivators EHMT2, EHMT1, and CBX3 as important contributors to GC-induced cell death. This complex selectively supports GC-induced expression of genes contributing to cell death. A metaanalysis of gene expression data from B-ALL patient specimens revealed that Aurora kinase B (AURKB), which restrains GC signaling by phosphorylating EHMT1-2, is overexpressed in relapsed B-ALL, suggesting it as a potential contributor to relapse. Inhibition of AURKB enhanced GC-induced expression of cell death genes, resulting in potentiation of GC cytotoxicity in cell lines and relapsed B-ALL patient samples. This function for AURKB is distinct from its canonical role in the cell cycle. These results show the utility of functional genomics in understanding mechanisms of resistance and rapidly identifying combination chemotherapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: TET2 Drives 5hmc Marking of GATA6 and Epigenetically Defines Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Transcriptional Subtypes.. Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by advanced disease stage at presentation, aggressive disease biology, and resistance to therapy, resulting in an extremely poor 5-year survival rate of <10%. PDAC is classified into transcriptional subtypes with distinct survival characteristics, although how these arise is not known. Epigenetic deregulation, rather than genetics, has been proposed to underpin progression, but exactly why is unclear and is hindered by the technical limitations of analyzing clinical samples. We performed genome-wide epigenetic mapping of DNA modifications 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) using oxidative bisulfite sequencing from formalin-embedded sections. We identified overlap with transcriptional signatures in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from resected patients, via bioinformatics using iCluster and mutational profiling and confirmed them in\u00a0vivo. We found that aggressive squamous-like PDAC subtypes result from epigenetic inactivation of loci, including GATA6, which promote differentiated classical pancreatic subtypes. We showed that squamous-like PDAC transcriptional subtypes are associated with greater loss of 5hmc due to reduced expression of the 5-methylcytosine hydroxylase TET2. Furthermore, we found that SMAD4 directly supports TET2 levels in classical pancreatic tumors, and loss of SMAD4 expression was associated with reduced 5hmc, GATA6, and squamous-like tumors. Importantly, enhancing TET2 stability using metformin and vitamin C/ascorbic acid restores 5hmc and GATA6 levels, reverting squamous-like tumor phenotypes and WNT-dependence in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. We identified epigenetic deregulation of pancreatic differentiation as an underpinning event behind the emergence of transcriptomic subtypes in PDAC. Our data showed that restoring epigenetic control increases biomarkers of classical pancreatic tumors that are associated with improved therapeutic responses and survival. Journal: Gastroenterology.

Abstract: Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) comprises a high-grade dedifferentiated (DD) component and a juxtaposed well-differentiated (WD) component. The DD component is believed to originate from the WD component by acquiring additional genomic alterations. In this study, we performed multiregion genome, epigenome, and transcriptome analyses of three patients with DDLPS. In two patients, there were few common genomic alterations across all samples, but many common alterations within DD or WD component samples. Phylogenetic trees predicted from the genomic alterations were consistent with those predicted from DNA methylation patterns. The expression patterns of adipogenesis-related genes differed between DD and WD components and also among patients in connection with their CpG island methylation status. These results indicate that in some patients, WD and DD components are evolutionarily separated at very early stages of tumorigenesis, and are formed through relatively long clonal selection with acquisition of different driver genomic alterations and DNA methylation changes.

Abstract: Since the advent of viral vector gene therapy in 1990s, cancer treatment with viral vectors promised to revolutionize the field of oncology. Notably, viral vectors offer a unique combination of efficient gene delivery and engagement of the immune system for anti-tumour response. Despite the early potential, viral vector-based cancer treatments are only recently making a big impact, most prominently as gene delivery devices in approved CAR-T cell therapies, cancer vaccines and targeted oncolytic therapeutics. To reach this broad spectrum of applications, a number of challenges have been overcome - from our understanding of cancer biology to vector design, manufacture and engineering. Here, we take an overview of viral vector usage in cancer therapy and discuss the latest advancements. We also consider production platforms that enable mainstream adoption of viral vectors for cancer gene therapy. Viral vectors offer numerous opportunities in cancer therapy. Recent advances in vector production platforms open new avenues in safe and efficient viral therapeutic strategies, streamlining the transition from lab bench to bedside. As viral vectors come of age, they could become a standard tool in the cancer treatment arsenal. Journal: Radiology and oncology. Year: 2022. Authors: Bezeljak U.

Abstract: To summarize the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, dosing, administration, and pharmacist perspectives related to operationalization of new and emerging bispecific therapies indicated for the treatment of various cancers. In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the expansion of immunotherapeutics in the treatment of various malignancies. Bispecific T cell-engaging therapies represent an emerging therapeutic drug class for the treatment of cancer. These therapies are unique antibody constructs that bind simultaneously to 2 targets, a tumor-specific antigen and CD3 on T cells, to elicit an immune response. Recently, several bispecific therapies have been approved, including epcoritamab, glofitamab, mosunetuzumab, tebentafusp, and teclistamab. Epcoritamab and glofitamab have been approved for diffuse large B cell lymphoma, while mosunetuzumab, tebentafusp, and teclistamab have been approved for follicular lymphoma, uveal melanoma, and multiple myeloma, respectively. As a result of their mechanism of action, the approved bispecific therapies have the potential to cause cytokine release syndrome, and, along with this, they all have unique and specific monitoring parameters and operational considerations that require clinician awareness when administering these therapies. Such operational challenges include within-patient dose escalations at therapy initiation, hospitalization for monitoring, and various pharmacological strategies for prophylaxis of cytokine release syndrome. Bispecific therapies have continued to evolve the therapeutic landscape of cancer, primarily in hematological malignancies. Health-system pharmacists have the opportunity to play a key role in the operationalization and management of this new and emerging drug class.

Abstract: The functions of mitochondria, including energy production and biomolecule synthesis, have been known for a long time. Given the rising incidence of cancer, the role of mitochondria in cancer has become increasingly popular. Activated by components released by mitochondria, various pathways interact with each other to induce immune responses to protect organisms from attack. However, mitochondria play dual roles in the progression of cancer. Abnormalities in proteins, which are the elementary structures of mitochondria, are closely linked with oncogenesis. Both the aberrant accumulation of intermediates and mutations in enzymes result in the generation and progression of cancer. Therefore, targeting mitochondria to treat cancer may be a new strategy. Several drugs aimed at inhibiting mutated enzymes and accumulated intermediates have been tested clinically. Here, we discuss the current understanding of mitochondria in cancer and the interactions between mitochondrial functions, immune responses, and oncogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss mitochondria as hopeful targets for cancer therapy, providing insights into the progression of future therapeutic strategies. Journal: Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Our attempts at adopting molecularly based treatment approaches have been slow and ineffective even though we begin to identify specific targetable gene mutations and pathways. It is clear that we should no longer treat all gastroesophageal cancers as a homogeneous disease, which is what we do when we use non-specific chemotherapy. However, we currently cannot monitor successful gene/pathway targeting, nor understand how/when tumors develop resistance, nor predict which patients will derive maximal benefit. To improve outcomes, we must precisely detail the heterogeneity of these tumors to then individualize cancer therapy as well as develop novel avenues to study and predict treatment effects in individual patients. To this end, patient-derived organoids, in which tumor cells from individual patients are grown in a Petri dish, are a new versatile system that allows for timely expandability, detailed molecular characterization, and genetic manipulation with the promise of enabling predictive assessment of treatment response. In this review, we will explore the development and basic techniques for organoid generation, and discuss the current and potential future applications of this exciting technology to study the basic science of carcinogenesis and to predict/guide cancer patient care in the clinics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Photodynamic Therapy Induced Mitochondrial Targeting Strategies for Cancer Treatment: Emerging Trends and Insights.. Abstract: The perpetuity of cancer prevalence at a global level calls for development of novel therapeutic approaches with improved targetability and reduced adverse effects. Conventional cancer treatments have a multitude of limitations such as nonselectivity, invasive nature, and severe adverse effects. Chemotherapy is also losing its efficacy because of the development of multidrug resistance in the majority of cancers. To address these issues, selective targeting-based approaches are being explored for an effective cancer treatment. Mitochondria, being the moderator of a majority of crucial cellular pathways like metabolism, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, are an effective targeting site. Mitochondria-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) has arisen as a potential approach in this endeavor. By designing photosensitizers (PSs) that preferentially accumulate in the mitochondria, PDT offers a localized technique to induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In this review, we intend to explore the crucial principles and challenges associated with mitochondria-targeted PDT, including variability in mitochondrial function, mitochondria-specific PSs, targeted nanocarrier-based monotherapy, and combination therapies. The hurdles faced by this emerging strategy with respect to safety, optimization, clinical translation, and scalability are also discussed. Nonetheless, mitochondria-targeted PDT exhibits a significant capacity in cancer treatment, especially in combination with other therapeutic modalities. With perpetual research and technological advancements, this treatment strategy is a great addition to the arsenal of cancer treatment options, providing better tumor targetability while reducing the damage to surrounding healthy tissues. This review emphasizes the current status of mitochondria-targeted PDT, limitations, and future prospects in its pursuit of safe and efficacious cancer therapy. Journal: Molecular pharmaceutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in tumor cells.. Abstract: VDAC1 is found at the crossroads of metabolic and survival pathways. VDAC1 controls metabolic cross-talk between mitochondria and the rest of the cell by allowing the influx and efflux of metabolites, ions, nucleotides, Ca2+ and more. The location of VDAC1 at the outer mitochondrial membrane also enables its interaction with proteins that mediate and regulate the integration of mitochondrial functions with cellular activities. As a transporter of metabolites, VDAC1 contributes to the metabolic phenotype of cancer cells. Indeed, this protein is over-expressed in many cancer types, and silencing of VDAC1 expression induces an inhibition of tumor development. At the same time, along with regulating cellular energy production and metabolism, VDAC1 is involved in the process of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by mediating the release of apoptotic proteins and interacting with anti-apoptotic proteins. The engagement of VDAC1 in the release of apoptotic proteins located in the inter-membranal space involves VDAC1 oligomerization that mediates the release of cytochrome c and AIF to the cytosol, subsequently leading to apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis can also be regulated by VDAC1, serving as an anchor point for mitochondria-interacting proteins, such as hexokinase (HK), Bcl2 and Bcl-xL, some of which are also highly expressed in many cancers. By binding to VDAC1, HK provides both a metabolic benefit and apoptosis-suppressive capacity that offer the cell a proliferative advantage and increase its resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, these and other functions point to VDAC1 as an excellent target for impairing the re-programed metabolism of cancer cells and their ability to evade apoptosis. Here, we review current evidence pointing to the function of VDAC1 in cell life and death, and highlight these functions in relation to both cancer development and therapy. In addressing the recently solved 3D structures of VDAC1, this review will point to structure-function relationships of VDAC as critical for deciphering how this channel can perform such a variety of roles, all of which are important for cell life and death. Finally, this review will also provide insight into VDAC function in Ca2+ homeostasis, protection against oxidative stress, regulation of apoptosis and involvement in several diseases, as well as its role in the action of different drugs. We will discuss the use of VDAC1-based strategies to attack the altered metabolism and apoptosis of cancer cells. These strategies include specific siRNA able to impair energy and metabolic homeostasis, leading to arrested cancer cell growth and tumor development, as well VDAC1-based peptides that interact with anti-apoptotic proteins to induce apoptosis, thereby overcoming the resistance of cancer cell to chemotherapy. Finally, small molecules targeting VDAC1 can induce apoptosis. VDAC1 can thus be considered as standing at the crossroads between mitochondrial metabolite transport and apoptosis and hence represents an emerging cancer drug target.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: New Target(s) for RNF43 Regulation: Implications for Therapeutic Strategies.. Abstract: Cancer cells depend on specific oncogenic pathways or present a genetic alteration that leads to a particular disturbance. Still, personalized and targeted biological therapy remains challenging, with current efforts generally yielding disappointing results. Carefully assessing onco-target molecular pathways can, however, potently assist with such efforts for the selection of patient populations that would best respond to a given drug treatment. RNF43, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates Wnt/frizzled (FZD) receptors by their ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation, controls a key pathway in cancer. Recently, additional target proteins of RNF43 were described, including p85 of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR<sub>2</sub>), a G-protein-coupled receptor that potently induces \u03b2-catenin stabilization, independent of Wnts. RNF43 mutations with impaired E3 ligase activity were found in several types of cancers (e.g., gastrointestinal system tumors and endometrial and ovarian cancer), pointing to a high dependency on FZD receptors and possibly PAR<sub>2</sub> and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The development of drugs toward these targets is essential for improved treatment of cancer patients. Journal: International journal of molecular sciences. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Refractory germ cell tumors (GCT), those progressing after known effective salvage therapies, carry a dismal prognosis with minimal treatment options of limited efficacy. This review aims to highlight the advances in understanding refractory GCT and review upcoming and active clinical trials with novel therapeutics in development. Patients with refractory disease after optimal salvage chemotherapy are rarely cured and should be referred to centers with expertise in GCT. While prior investigational agents have not overcome current limitations of salvage therapy, current and upcoming trials of novel agents including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE), and antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are promising avenues of therapy. Outcomes in refractory GCT remain poor. Patients should preferably be evaluated at tertiary care centers with expertise in the management of these patients and access to clinical trials of novel therapeutics.

Abstract: Lung carcinoids (L-CDs) are rare, poorly characterised neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). L-CDs are more common in women and are not the consequence of cigarette smoking. They are classified histologically as typical carcinoids (TCs) or atypical carcinoids (ACs). ACs confer a worse survival. Histological classification is imperfect, and there is increasing interest in molecular markers. We therefore investigated global transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of 15 L-CDs resected with curative intent at Royal Brompton Hospital. We identified underlying mutations and structural abnormalities through whole-exome sequencing (WES) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Transcriptomic clustering algorithms identified two distinct L-CD subtypes. These showed similarities either to pancreatic or neuroendocrine tumours at other sites and so were named respectively L-CD-PanC and L-CD-NeU. L-CD-PanC tumours featured upregulation of pancreatic and metabolic pathway genes matched by promoter hypomethylation of genes for beta cells and insulin secretion (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-6</sup>). These tumours were centrally located and showed mutational signatures of activation-induced deaminase/apolipoprotein B editing complex \u00a0activity, together with genome-wide DNA methylation loss enriched in repetitive elements (p\u2009=\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-16</sup>). By contrast, the L-CD-NeU group exhibited upregulation of neuronal markers (adjusted p\u2009<\u20090.01) and was characterised by focal spindle cell morphology (p\u2009=\u20090.04), peripheral location (p\u2009=\u20090.01), high mutational load (p\u2009=\u20092.17\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-4</sup>), recurrent copy number alterations, and enrichment for ACs. Mutations affected chromatin remodelling and SWI/SNF complex pathways. L-CD-NeU tumours carried a mutational signature attributable to aflatoxin and aristolochic acid (p\u2009=\u20090.05), suggesting a possible environmental exposure in their pathogenesis. Immunologically, myeloid and T-cell markers were enriched in L-CD-PanC and B-cell markers in L-CD-NeU tumours. The substantial epigenetic and non-coding differences between L-CD-PanC and L-CD-NeU open new possibilities for biomarker selection and targeted treatment of L-CD. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

Abstract: The necessity to accurately predict recurrence and clinical outcome in early stage colorectal cancer (CRC) is critical to identify those patients who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Here, we developed and validated a gene-based risk-score algorithm for patient stratification and personalised treatment in early stage disease based on alterations in the secretion of metastasis-related proteins. A quantitative label-free proteomic analysis of the secretome of highly and poorly metastatic CRC cell lines with different genetic backgrounds revealed 153 differentially secreted proteins (fold-change >5). These changes in the secretome were validated at the transcriptomic level. Starting from 119 up-regulated proteins, a six-gene/protein-based prognostic signature composed of IGFBP3, CD109, LTBP1, PSAP, BMP1, and NPC2 was identified after sequential discovery, training, and validation in four different cohorts. This signature was used to develop a risk-score algorithm, named SEC6, for patient stratification. SEC6 risk-score components showed higher expression in the poor prognosis CRC subtypes: consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4), CRIS-B, and stem-like. High expression of the signature was also associated with patients showing dMMR, CIMP<sup>+</sup> status, and BRAF mutations. In addition, the SEC6 signature was associated with lower overall survival, progression-free interval, and disease-specific survival in stage II and III patients. SEC6-based risk stratification indicated that 5-FU treatment was beneficial for low-risk patients, whereas only aggressive treatments (FOLFOX and FOLFIRI) provided benefits to high-risk patients in stages II and III. In summary, this novel risk-score demonstrates the value of the secretome compartment as a reliable source for the retrieval of biomarkers with high prognostic and chemotherapy-predictive capacity, providing a potential new tool for tailoring decision-making in patient care.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: SIX1 amplification modulates stemness and tumorigenesis in breast cancer.. Abstract: Sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1) is a transcription factor that has recently been identified as a crucial regulator of embryonic development and tumorigenesis. SIX1 is upregulated in different types of tumors, including breast cancer. However, the role and mechanism of SIX1 upregulation in breast cancer carcinogenesis remains uncertain. In this study, we utilized various databases such as UALCAN, TCGA, STRING, and Kaplan-Meier Plotter to investigate the mRNA expression, prognosis, transcriptional profile changes, signal pathway rewiring, and interaction with cancer stem cells of SIX1 in breast cancer. We also conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments to validate its positive regulation effect on breast cancer stem cells. Our findings demonstrated that the expression of SIX1 varies among different subtypes of breast cancer and that it upregulates breast cancer grading and lymph node metastasis. Besides, SIX1 participates in the rewiring of several cancer signaling pathways, including estrogen, WNT, MAPK, and other pathways, and interacts with cancer stem cells. SIX1 showed a significant positive correlation with breast cancer stem cell markers such as ALDH1A1, EPCAM, ITGB1, and SOX2. Moreover, our in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that SIX1 can promote the increase in the proportion of stem cells and tumor progression. Altogether, our results suggest that SIX1 plays an essential regulatory role in breast cancer's occurrence, and its amplification can be utilized as a diagnostic and prognostic predictor. The interaction between SIX1 and cancer stem cells may play a critical role in regulating breast cancer's initiation and metastasis. Journal: Journal of translational medicine. Year: 2023.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: High-level copy number gains of established and potential drug target genes in gastric cancer as a lead for treatment development and selection.. Abstract: The overall survival rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer is poor. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new treatment options for these patients. The identification of drug target genes located on DNA regions exhibiting high-level copy number gains (CNG) may be an effective approach, as has e.g. previously been shown for HER2. The aim of the present study was to identify putative drug targets in patients with gastric cancer by applying this strategy. Genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) data available from 183 primary gastric cancer samples were analyzed through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to assess whether any established or potential anticancer drug target genes showed high-level CNG, including focal amplifications. A total of 147 high-level gained regions were identified in the gastric cancer samples, harboring 167 genes that had previously been annotated as drug target genes. Thirty (18 %) of these genes showed high-level gains in at least 2 % of the tumors. The identified drug target genes included those for drugs known to be active in advanced (gastric) cancer, targets for targeted therapies in clinical development, as well as targets for drugs currently used for other indications but of potential interest for anticancer treatment. In addition, 12 potential drug target genes were identified, including genes involved in growth factor signaling and cell cycle regulation. The majority of gastric cancers carried one or more high-level CNGs or focal amplifications encompassing putative drug target genes. A number of the associated drugs are currently not being considered for treatment of gastric cancer. Based on these results we hypothesize that DNA copy number profiling may be a useful tool to identify new drug targets and to guide individualized treatment strategies in patients with gastric cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Differences Between Intravenous and Subcutaneous Modes of Administration in Oncology from the Patient, Healthcare Provider, and Healthcare System Perspectives: A Systematic Review.. Abstract: While patients with cancer have traditionally received oncology treatments through intravenous (IV) administration, some therapies are becoming available via alternative modes of administration, such as subcutaneous (SC). This study aimed to evaluate IV versus SC therapy administration from the perspectives of the patient, healthcare provider (HCP), and healthcare system. A systematic review was conducted, searching MEDLINE and Embase databases from 2000 to 2022. This was supplemented with grey literature searches of additional sources such as conference proceedings. Observational studies and clinical trials were included if they assessed adult patients with any cancer type who were treated with pharmacologic therapies administered via IV or SC and included patient- or HCP-reported outcomes or healthcare system perspectives on the mode of administration. Records identified by the literature search were screened by two independent reviewers. Included studies were data extracted by a single reviewer and validated by a second reviewer and synthesized using a narrative approach. After screening, 33 unique studies were included in the systematic review. Patients and HCPs reported substantially more favorable preference rates for SC over IV treatment. Additionally, from the patient perspective there were reductions in treatment time and economic burden for SC compared with IV therapy. From the HCP's perspective, treatment time was consistently reduced by SC compared with IV treatment administration. Although information on the impact of SC and IV treatments for oncology on healthcare systems was limited, the use of SC formulations showed consistent cost savings (direct costs) and time savings from this perspective considering various uptake scenarios compared with IV administration. Compared with IV administration, SC oncology treatment is a preferred option by patients and HCPs, increasing optionality and reducing treatment time while simultaneously increasing capacity and reducing the financial burden on healthcare systems.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Review of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.. Abstract: Mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) is a rare subtype of aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that remains incurable with standard therapy. Patients typically require multiple lines of therapy, and those with relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease have a very poor prognosis. The Bruton tyrosine kinase (btk) inhibitor ibrutinib has proven to be an effective agent for patients with r/r mcl. Although usually well tolerated, ibrutinib can be associated with unique toxicities, requiring discontinuation in some patients. Effective and well-tolerated alternatives to ibrutinib for patients with r/r mcl are therefore needed. Novel btk inhibitors such as acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, and tirabrutinib are designed to improve on the safety and efficacy of first-generation btk inhibitors such as ibrutinib. Data from single-arm clinical trials suggest that, compared with ibrutinib, second-generation btk inhibitors have comparable efficacy and might have a more favourable toxicity profile. Those newer btk inhibitors might therefore provide a viable treatment option for patients with r/r mcl. Journal: Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.). Year: 2019.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a common malignant tumor among women whose prognosis is largely determined by the period and accuracy of diagnosis. We here propose to identify a robust DNA methylation-based breast cancer-specific diagnostic signature. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of breast cancer patients along with their adjacent normal tissues from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were obtained as the training set. CpGs that with significantly elevated methylation level in breast cancer than not only their adjacent normal tissues and the other ten common cancers from TCGA but also the healthy breast tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were finally remained for logistic regression analysis. Another independent breast cancer DNA methylation dataset from GEO was used as the testing set. Lots of CpGs were hyper-methylated in breast cancer samples compared with adjacent normal tissues, which tend to be negatively correlated with gene expressions. Eight CpGs located at RIIAD1, ENPP2, ESPN, and ETS1, were finally retained. The diagnostic model was reliable in separating BRCA from normal samples. Besides, chromatin accessibility status of RIIAD1, ENPP2, ESPN and ETS1 showed great differences between MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. In conclusion, the present study should be helpful for breast cancer early and accurate diagnosis. Journal: Bioscience reports. Year: 2020. Authors: Liu X, Peng Y, Wang J.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Nanoparticle drug delivery to target breast cancer brain metastasis: Current and future trends.. Abstract: Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is rapidly becoming an impediment to continuing survival gains seen in breast cancer patients. Drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier is the main issue hindering systemic therapy against BCBM. This review details recent advances in nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery systems to target BCBM. Their primary benefits are: enhanced circulating and intra-BCBM drug biodistribution, BCBM targeting through NP functionalization, opportunities for gene manipulation and their theragnostic applications. Multiple NPs have been synthesized to deliver therapeutic HER2 blockade, which is particularly important given HER2-positive breast cancer's tendency to form BCBM. Finally, we review the clinical context in which NP-based therapeutics have been investigated in BCBM patients. While a breakthrough in improving patient outcomes remain awaited, these clinical trials represent positive steps in the changing attitude towards BCBM as a treatable illness. Although multiple challenges remain in the clinical translation of BCBM-directed NP therapies, ongoing research in the field offers promising avenues for novel targeting of this devastating disease.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GB) is an aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options, making it crucial to integrate genomic and transcriptomic profiling to identify genetic alterations and cellular functional states. We perform short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing on 42 Chinese GB patients to characterize the intra- and extrachromosomal mutation landscape, cell-type composition, and pathway activity. Our analysis identifies amplified oncogenes, including EGFR, MYC, CDK4, PDGFRA, and PPARGC1A, localized on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Notably, EGFR ecDNA harbors distinct structures that correlate with patient survival and exhibit a unique DNA methylation pattern that influences gene expression, driving malignant cell differentiation toward MES-like and AC-like subtypes. Specifically, EGFR ecDNA stabilizes tumor-associated macrophages in a hypoxia- and metabolism-driven state, reinforcing a reciprocal AREG-EGFR signaling loop with mesenchymal-like tumor cells. Together, these findings uncover a mechanistic link between ecDNA architecture, transcriptional subtypes, and microenvironmental remodeling, offering critical insights for advancing precision oncology in GB.

Abstract: Synthetic lethality (SL) is a breakthrough concept in cancer therapy that describes a scenario in which the simultaneous inactivation of two genes leads to cell death, whereas inactivation of either gene alone does not. The rise of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) technology has provided a new tool for exploring this phenomenon, enabling genome editing and screening. This review evaluates the advancements achieved by CRISPR technology in identifying novel therapeutic targets and comprehending the processes of drug resistance using the concept of SL in cancer cells. This review explores the fundamental concept of SL and its application in cancer therapy, highlighting how the CRISPR-Cas9 system functions and how CRISPR-based screening can be leveraged to identify synthetic lethal genes and investigate the mechanisms of drug resistance. We summarize important research in related fields from recent years, demonstrating the role of CRISPR screening in revealing cancer cellular pathways and identifying new drug targets. We also summarize the clinical trials of related drugs currently underway, and anticipate that with the continuous development of CRISPR technology, its integration with cancer genetics and immuno-oncology will bring new hope to patients with drug-resistant cancers.

We discuss the ongoing development of FR\u03b1-targeting antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the first of which has been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer, providing the impetus for heightened research and therapy development. Novel insights into the tumor microenvironment, advances in antibody engineering to enhance immune-mediated effects, the emergence of ADCs, and several studies of anti-FR\u03b1 agents combined with chemotherapy, targeted and immune therapy are offering new perspectives and treatment possibilities. Hence, we highlight key translational research and discuss several preclinical studies and clinical trials of interest, with an emphasis on agents and therapy combinations with potential to change future clinical practice.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Small non-coding RNAs as therapeutic targets with delivery strategies in cancer treatment and their clinical applications.. Abstract: Recent advances in RNA biology have revealed unexpected diversity and complexity in RNA molecules and in cellular RNA metabolism. While protein-coding genes have taken center stage for decades, attention has significantly shifted toward the silent majority of the human genome, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Aberrant ncRNA expression is closely linked to critical processes involved in cancer, including cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. As such, ncRNAs represent promising targets for cancer therapy and are critical molecular markers for cancer prediction and prognosis, providing guidance for clinical decision-making. Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), tRNA-derived small RNAs (tRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), arerdysregulatedarious cancers. These molecules can influence cancer progression through various mechanisms, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications, epigenetics, and signal transduction pathways. Therefore, these small molecules hold significant promise as cancer biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. RNA technology offers promise as a therapeutic intervention for targeted gene silencing in cancer, and several RNA-based formulations are being evaluated in clinical trials for this purpose. Therefore, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of cancer development, identifying specific therapeutic targets, and developing effective drug delivery systems are essential. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms is also significant for the future development of RNA-targeted therapies. Carrier systems that facilitate the effective and safe delivery of small noncoding RNA-based therapeutics are crucial for successful clinical applications. RNA therapeutics must be delivered to the relevant organ and cell type and efficiently across the cell membrane to perform their intracellular functions. However, achieving therapeutic success requires a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving cancer, precise identification of therapeutic targets, and development of efficient and safe delivery systems for these agents. This review examines the biogenesis of sncRNAs, their mechanisms of action, nanoformulation strategies, and studies focusing on sncRNA delivery systems. In addition, we present the cancer-fighting potential of RNA and RNA-related therapies and examine the current status of sncRNA therapeutics in the clinical trials.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Multi-omics analysis of parthanatos related molecular subgroup and prognostic model development in stomach adenocarcinoma.. Abstract: Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), the most prevalent histological subtype of gastric cancer, exhibits high heterogeneity and poor prognosis, posing significant therapeutic challenges. Parthanatos, a distinct form of regulated cell death mediated by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), has been implicated in tumor biology and therapeutic resistance; however, the role of parthanatos-associated genes (PRGs) in STAD remains largely unexplored. In this study, we performed a comprehensive multi-omics analysis integrating transcriptomic, genomic, and clinical data from public databases to delineate the molecular landscape of PRGs in STAD. Unsupervised clustering revealed distinct PRG-related molecular subtypes with significant differences in clinical outcomes, immune infiltration profiles, and biological pathway activation. Based on machine learning algorithms, we established and validated a novel PRG-based prognostic signature, which demonstrated robust predictive performance. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing and in vitro functional assays were conducted to explore cellular heterogeneity and gene function. Notably, in vitro experiments, including western blot, colony formation, CCK-8, and Transwell assays, confirmed that one key PRG, COL8A1, promotes STAD cell proliferation and migration. Collectively, our findings highlight the clinical and biological significance of PRGs in STAD, offering novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for STAD precision treatment.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrated exome and transcriptome sequencing reveals ZAK isoform usage in gastric cancer.. Abstract: Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of worldwide cancer mortality, yet the underlying genomic alterations remain poorly understood. Here we perform exome and transcriptome sequencing and SNP array assays to characterize 51 primary gastric tumours and 32 cell lines. Meta-analysis of exome data and previously published data sets reveals 24 significantly mutated genes in microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours and 16 in microsatellite instable (MSI) tumours. Over half the patients in our collection could potentially benefit from targeted therapies. We identify 55 splice site mutations accompanied by aberrant splicing products, in addition to mutation-independent differential isoform usage in tumours. ZAK kinase isoform TV1 is preferentially upregulated in gastric tumours and cell lines relative to normal samples. This pattern is also observed in colorectal, bladder and breast cancers. Overexpression of this particular isoform activates multiple cancer-related transcription factor reporters, while depletion of ZAK in gastric cell lines inhibits proliferation. These results reveal the spectrum of genomic and transcriptomic alterations in gastric cancer, and identify isoform-specific oncogenic properties of ZAK. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2014.

Abstract: To evaluate treatment efficacy of cisplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan combined therapy (PEI), platinum-rechallenge chemotherapy (Pt-Re) and amrubicin monotherapy (AMR) for patients with sensitive relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We defined sensitive relapse as treatment-free interval (TFI) \u226590 days. We retrospectively collected patients' data from medical records between September 2002 and December 2016. Patients with sensitive relapsed SCLC who received second-line chemotherapy were separated into those treated with PEI, with Pt-Re, or with AMR. Seventy-one patients (16 PEI group, 27 Pt-Re group, and 28 AMR group) were assessable for efficacy. No significant differences in patient characteristics were found among the three groups. The median overall survival (MST) was 29.3 months in the PEI group, 24.6 months in the Pt-Re group, and 20.6 months in the AMR group (p=0.042). A significant difference was observed in the overall survival of patients treated with PEI, Pt-Re and AMR and the MST of PEI was the longest. Journal: In vivo (Athens, Greece). Year: 2019.

Abstract: As the most lethal gynecological malignant tumor, ovarian cancer is prone to recurrence and drug resistance. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are known to be effective in ovarian cancer patients as maintenance treatment, especially in patients with BRCA mutation. The current controversy is whether the use of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors may affect subsequent platinum sensitivity. A Chinese female patient diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancer experienced five platinum-sensitive relapses. After obtaining informed consent from the patient, we performed next-generation gene sequencing and detected a germline BRCA1 pathologic mutation. When the patient achieved partial response with platinum after the fifth platinum-sensitive relapse, exploratory posterior-line maintenance therapy was performed due to her genotype. But the patient rapidly progressed to platinum resistance after poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor resistance. In a gBRCAmt patient with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, olaparib as exploratory posterior-line maintenance treatment is barely effective and may affect the response to subsequent platinum therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: NDR2 kinase: A review of its physiological role and involvement in carcinogenesis.. Abstract: The Hippo kinase, NDR2, plays a key role in the natural history of several human cancers, particularly lung cancer, by regulating processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, vesicular trafficking, autophagy, ciliogenesis and immune response. To examine the specificity of NDR2's action, interaction and function in physiological or tumoral contexts, we first focus on the structural differences in the amino-acid sequence between NDR1 and NDR2. We then establish a correlation between these NDR1/2 differences and specific post-translational regulation, as well as the distinct action, interactions, and functions of NDR2 in physiological or tumoral paradigms, such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the full set of NDR2 partners and/or substrates remains to be identified. Given that it is hypothesized that NDR2 and its partners may offer new perspectives for anticancer therapies, we emphasize potential clustering or functional enrichment networks among the NDR2-specific interactants. Additionally, we provide an unpublished proteomic comparison of the NDR1 versus NDR2 interactome, focusing on human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC-3), lung adenocarcinoma cells (H2030), and their brain metastasis-derived counterparts (H2030-BrM3). In conclusion, this study underscores the pivotal role of NDR2 in cancer progression, particularly lung cancer, and helps to better understand their specific functions and interactions in both normal and tumor contexts. The identification of NDR2 partners and substrates remains essential, with the potential to open new avenues for anticancer therapies. Journal: International journal of biological macromolecules.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Wnt signalling in gynaecological cancers: A future target for personalised medicine?. Abstract: The three major gynaecological cancers, ovarian, uterine and cervical, contribute a significant burden to global cancer mortality, and affect women in both developed and developing countries. However, unlike other cancer types that have seen rapid advances and incorporation of targeted treatments in recent years, personalised medicine is not yet a reality in the treatment of gynaecological cancers. Advances in sequencing technology and international collaborations and initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas are now revealing the molecular basis of these cancers, and highlighting key signalling pathways involved. One pathway which plays a role in all three cancer types, is the Wnt signalling pathway. This complex developmental pathway is altered in most human malignancies, and members of this pathway, particularly the recently linked ROR receptor tyrosine kinases may be attractive future therapeutic targets. This review provides an up-to-date summary of research into Wnt signalling and ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers, and discusses the potential of the Wnt pathway as a future target for personalised medicine in gynaecological cancers.

The number of molecularly targeted therapies under development is increasing.

This molecular segmentation of breast cancer and the multitude of new drugs to be tested (alone and in combination) lead to develop clinical trials based on the molecular profile of tumors to guide the patient towards the most suitable drug.

Abstract: To determine the toxicity and prognosis of patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) using augmented preparative regimens, treated in a major cooperative group setting, and to examine prognostic factors for outcome. Ninety-four patients with either chemosensitive (50 patients) or chemoresistant (44 patients) relapse, including 22 who failed induction chemotherapy, were treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide and etoposide with total-body irradiation (TBI) (67 patients) or an augmented carmustine (BCNU), cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (BCV) preparative regimen (27 patients) and an ABMT at 16 Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) transplant centers. All relapsing patients were required to undergo a minimum of two courses of salvage therapy to determine chemosensitivity before transplant. Overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined and a Cox regression model was used to assess potential prognostic variables. Of the 94 eligible patients, there were 10 (10.6%) deaths before day 50 posttransplant because of infection (six deaths), hemorrhagic alveolitis (three deaths), or bleeding (one death). The median 3-year PFS and OS for the entire group was 33% and 44%. For those with chemosensitive disease the PFS and OS were 42% and 55%, whereas for those with chemoresistant disease the PFS and OS were 22% and 29%. The PFS and OS for those failing induction chemotherapy were 27% and 32%. The relapse rates within the first 3 years for the chemosensitive relapse, chemoresistant, and induction failure groups were 61%, 40%, and 59%, respectively. For both PFS and OS, only disease status at transplant was a significant factor in the multivariate Cox model. These results single institutional pilot trials exploring augmented preparative regimens. Patients undergoing transplantation for resistant disease, particularly those failing induction chemotherapy, appear to have an improved prognosis as compared with reports using standard preparative regimens. Therapies other than manipulation of standard preparative regimens appear to be required to decrease relapses following autotransplantation.

Abstract: The Wnt signalling pathway plays a role in the direction of embryological development and maintenance of stem cell populations. Heritable alterations in genes encoding molecules of the Wnt pathway, including mutation and epigenetic events, have been demonstrated in a variety of cancers. It has been proposed that disruption of this pathway is a significant step in the development of many tumours. Interactions between beta-catenin--the effector molecule of the Wnt pathway--and the androgen receptor highlight the pathway's relevance to urological malignancy. Mutation or altered expression of Wnt genes in tumours may give prognostic information and treatments are being developed which target this pathway. Journal: Prostate cancer and prostatic diseases.

Abstract: Cell-cell communication (CCC) is a critical process within the tumor microenvironment, governing regulatory interactions between cancer cells and other cellular subpopulations. Aiming to improve the accuracy and completeness of intercellular gene-regulatory network inference, we constructed a novel spatial-resolved gene-regulatory network framework (spGRN). Firstly, the spatial multi-omics data of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were analyzed. We precisely located the tumor boundaries and then systematically constructed the spGRN framework to study the network regulation. Subsequently, the key signaling molecules obtained by the spGRN were identified and further validated by the spatial-proteomics dataset. Through the constructed spatial gene regulatory network, we found that in the communication with malignant cells, the highly expressed ligands <i>LIF</i> and <i>LGALS3BP</i> and receptors <i>IL6ST</i> and <i>ITGB1</i> in fibroblasts can promote tumor proliferation, and the highly expressed ligands <i>S100A8/S100A9</i> in plasma cells play an important role in regulating inflammatory responses. Further, validation of the key signaling molecules by the spatial-proteomics dataset highlighted the role of these genes in mediating the regulation of boundary-related cells. Furthermore, we applied the spGRN to publicly available single-cell and spatial-transcriptomics datasets from three other cancer types. The results demonstrate that ITGB1 and its target genes FOS/JUN were commonly expressed in all four cancer types, indicating their potential as pan-cancer therapeutic targets. the spGRN was proven to be a useful tool to select signal molecules as potential biomarkers or valuable therapeutic targets.

Abstract: A significant impediment to the treatment of solid and nonsolid cancers is the decline of drug efficacy and/or occurrence of adverse effects. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in oncolytic viruses (OVs) as a method to treat cancer because of their specificity for cancerous tissue and reduced likelihood of adverse effects. The results of clinical trials suggest that OVs have an acceptable safety profile and are effective in treating certain types of cancer, despite the limited number of these organisms. However, further advances are needed to make oncolytic virotherapy more effective by increasing tumor permeation and improving virus delivery. Combining oncolytic virotherapy with conventional treatments, such as targeted inhibitory drugs (e.g., histone deacetylase inhibitors), could results in safer, more reliable, and more effective therapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia after the first relapse: curative strategies.. Abstract: Treatment of recurrent childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been controversial in the last decade. Conventional intensive chemotherapy (CHEMO) can cure up to 30% of children who have relapsed after ALL: similar results have been obtained with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), but allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (AlloBMT) seems to be the best therapeutic option. In this review the authors point out the contribution of current strategy in the setting of children with ALL who experience a first relapse and should be offered optimal treatment in order to obtain the best disease-free survival (DFS). The principal objective of this issue is to reach a possible consensus on the more controversial points regarding factors considered strong predictors of the outcome of the relapsed patients, second-line chemotherapy, optimal timing and type of transplantation. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCE: Data published in the literature over the last decade concerning early and late relapse in childhood ALL suggest that improvements in cure rates may be achieved by intensification of the relapse treatment both with chemotherapy and with different types of transplantation. An accurate search for Medline data has been performed in order to understand the risk-benefit ratio of aggressive therapy adopted in this setting. Modern first-line treatment protocols for childhood ALL have contributed to curing an ever larger number of patients but this strategy could be responsible for creating a more resistant leukemic clone at the time of systemic or extramedullary relapse. This hypothesis emerges from a number of single or multicenter experiences; thus clinical and biological features in relapsed patients are being studied carefully in order to understand which risk-directed second-line therapy should be best adopted. The BFM group classified ALL relapses as \"very early\", \"early\", or \"late\" according to the time from diagnosis to first relapse (i.e. < 18, > 18 and < 30 or more than 30 months) and has shown that about 2/3 of the small fraction of children with late extramedullary relapses or late non T-marrow relapses or early combined non T-relapses can be rescued by chemotherapy; in contrast ALL early relapses or T-immunophenotype ALL relapses can be rescue only by AlloBMT. Since 1990 the AIEOP group adopted BFM-like first-line treatment and experienced similar situations for relapsed patients so that, even in absence of a real common relapse protocol, they went in the same direction as the BFM group as far as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) procedures and decision were concerned. A recent AIEOP study on the destiny of 192 consecutive patients with ALL in 2nd complete remission and not having an HLA suitable sibling donor is presented in this issue. The value of different HSCT procedures is addressed and the protection against a new relapse seems to be real, although, of course, the risk-benefit ratio should always be evaluated. Very few prospective studies on the treatment of childhood ALL relapse have been set up in the last decade because of many difficulties regarding common second-line therapies, some reluctance versus HSCT in consideration of the transplant-related mortality and the so-called late effects. Additional modifications of allogeneic family and unrelated donor HSCT strategies and the promising results both of cord HSCT and auto-grafting methods including in vitro purging or post-transplant immunotherapy, are making transplantation procedures for ALL relapsed patients more appropriate and increasing confidence in their use. The possibility of performing common prospective international studies should be encouraged over the next years in order to elucidate an area of great research as is that of the treatment of childhood ALL relapse.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Despite identification of several biomarkers for HCC diagnosis, challenges such as low sensitivity and intratumoral heterogeneity have impeded early detection, highlighting the need for etiology-specific blood biomarkers. We generated whole-transcriptome sequencing (WTS) and targeted proteome data from buffy coat and plasma samples from HCC patients. By integrating etiological information on viral infection, we investigated the etiology-specific gene expression landscape at the blood level. Validation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed using publicly available RNA-seq datasets and qRT\u2012PCR with AUC analyses. Differential expression analyses with multiomics data revealed distinct gene expression profiles between HBV-associated HCC and nonviral HCC, indicating the presence of etiology-specific blood biomarkers. The identified DEGs were validated across multiple independent datasets, underscoring their utility as biomarkers. Additionally, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of HCC confirmed differences in DEG expression across distinct immune cell types. Our buffy coat WTS data and plasma proteome data may serve as reliable sources for identifying etiology-specific blood biomarkers of HCC and might contribute to discovery of therapeutic targets for HCC across different etiologies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Therapeutic Targeting of Non-oncogene Dependencies in High-risk Neuroblastoma.. Abstract: Neuroblastoma is a pediatric malignancy of the sympathetic nervous system with diverse clinical behaviors. Genomic amplification of <i>MYCN</i> oncogene has been shown to drive neuroblastoma pathogenesis and correlate with aggressive disease, but the survival rates for those high-risk tumors carrying no <i>MYCN</i> amplification remain equally dismal. The paucity of mutations and molecular heterogeneity has hindered the development of targeted therapies for most advanced neuroblastomas. We use an alternative method to identify potential drugs that target nononcogene dependencies in high-risk neuroblastoma. By using a gene expression-based integrative approach, we identified prognostic signatures and potentially effective single agents and drug combinations for high-risk neuroblastoma. Among these predictions, we validated <i>in vitro</i> efficacies of some investigational and marketed drugs, of which niclosamide, an anthelmintic drug approved by the FDA, was further investigated <i>in vivo</i>. We also quantified the proteomic changes during niclosamide treatment to pinpoint nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3 (NME3) downregulation as a potential mechanism for its antitumor activity. Our results establish a gene expression-based strategy to interrogate cancer biology and inform drug discovery and repositioning for high-risk neuroblastoma.

Abstract: Dasatinib and nilotinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) developed to overcome imatinib resistance in Philadelphia-positive leukemias. To assess how Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutation status evolves during sequential therapy with these TKIs and which mutations may further develop and impair their efficacy, we monitored the mutation status of 95 imatinib-resistant patients before and during treatment with dasatinib and/or nilotinib as second or third TKI. We found that 83% of cases of relapse after an initial response are associated with emergence of newly acquired mutations. However, the spectra of mutants conferring resistance to dasatinib or nilotinib are small and nonoverlapping, except for T315I. Patients already harboring mutations had higher likelihood of relapse associated with development of further mutations compared with patients who did not harbor mutations (23 of 51 vs 8 of 44, respectively, for patients who relapsed on second TKI; 13 of 20 vs 1 of 6, respectively, for patients who relapsed on third TKI).

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Long non-coding RNAs in gastrointestinal cancers: Implications for protein phosphorylation.. Abstract: Phosphorylation of proteins is one of the most extensively investigated post-translational protein modifications. Threonine, serine and tyrosine in proteins are the most commonly phosphorylated amino acids. Dysregulated cancer-related signaling pathways due to aberrant phosphorylation status of the key protein(s) in these pathways exist in most malignancies. Intensive studies in the recent decade have implicated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the precise regulation of protein phosphorylation in cancers. In this review, we systematically delve into recent advance that underlines the multidimensional role of lncRNAs in modulating protein phosphorylation, regulating cancerous signaling and impacting prognosis of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. LncRNAs regulate protein phosphorylation via directly binding to the target protein(s), interacting with the partner protein(s) of the target protein(s) or lncRNAs-encoded small peptides. Although there are still extensive studies on disclosing the intricate interactions between lncRNAs and proteins and their impacts on protein phosphorylation, we believe that targeting lncRNAs controlling phosphorylation of key protein(s) in cancerous signaling pathways might provide novel paths for precision therapeutics of GI cancers in the future.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Identification of human miR-1839-5p by small RNA-seq, a miRNA enriched in neoplastic tissues.. Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate gene expression through destabilization or translational inhibition of cytoplasmic transcripts or by transcriptional regulation through binding to genomic DNA. Although miRNAs are globally down-regulated in cancer, some are overexpressed in neoplastic tissues, playing key roles in tumorigenesis (oncomiRs), sometimes behaving as effective cancer markers. Using total RNA from human uterus adenocarcinoma and non-neoplastic uterus, we conducted a small RNA-sequencing experiment followed by prediction of novel miRNAs using MirDeep* software. Synteny analysis and whole genome alignments were performed using BLAST. We also evaluated expression by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in normal tissues of the FSD2 gene, which spans the human miR-1839-5p gene in the opposite direction. MirDeep* analysis predicted a miRNA not previously annotated in databases, identical to and likely the orthologue of mouse miR-1839-5p. Whole-genome local alignments of this miRNA revealed a single perfect hit that is indeed syntenic to mouse miR-1839-5p. Alignments with other mammalian orthologues showed considerable conservation. We validated the prediction via a stem-loop RT-PCR assay, also employed to screen RNA samples from several additional normal and cancer tissues, showing increased expression in neoplastic tissues compared to their respective non neoplastic counterparts. Human heart tissue expresses both miR-1839-5p and FSD2. Human tissues express an orthologue of mouse miR-1839-5p and, given its expression pattern, we suggest that this miRNA could be explored as a potential oncomiR or cancer marker. Also, according to the genomic organization of miR-1839-5p and FSD2, perfect complementarity exists between the two elements, making possible miRNA-directed cleavage in human cardiac tissue.

Abstract: DNA sequencing has identified recurrent mutations that drive the aggressiveness of prostate cancers. Surprisingly, the influence of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic dysregulation on the tumor proteome remains poorly understood. We profiled the genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of 76 localized, intermediate-risk prostate cancers. We discovered that the genomic subtypes of prostate cancer converge on five proteomic subtypes, with distinct clinical trajectories. ETS fusions, the most common alteration in prostate tumors, affect different genes and pathways in the proteome and transcriptome. Globally, mRNA abundance changes explain only \u223c10% of protein abundance variability. As a result, prognostic biomarkers combining genomic or epigenomic features with proteomic ones significantly outperform biomarkers comprised of a single data type. Journal: Cancer cell. Year: 2019.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Recognition Sites for Cancer-targeting Drug Delivery Systems.. Abstract: Target-homing drug delivery systems are now gaining significant attention for use as novel therapeutic approaches in antitumor targeting for cancer therapy. Numerous targeted drug delivery systems have been designed to improve the targeting effects because these systems can display a range of favorable properties, thus, providing suitable characteristics for clinical applicability of anticancer drugs, such as increasing the solubility, and improving the drug distribution at target sites. The majority of these targeting systems are designed with respect to differences between cancerous and normal tissues, for instance, the low pH of tumor tissues or overexpressed receptors on tumor cell membranes. Due to the growing number of targeting possibilities, it is important to know the tumor-specific recognition strategies for designing novel, targeted, drug delivery systems. Herein, we identify and summarize literature pertaining to various recognition sites for optimizing the design of targeted drug delivery systems to augment current chemotherapeutic approaches. This review focuses on the identification of the recognition sites for developing targeted drug delivery systems for use in cancer therapeutics. We have reviewed and compiled cancer-specific recognition sites and their abnormal characteristics within tumor tissues (low pH, high glutathione, targetable receptors, etc.), tumor cells (receptor overexpression or tumor cell membrane changes) and tumor cell organelles (nuclear and endoplasmic reticular dysregulation) utilizing existing scientific literature. Moreover, we have highlighted the design of some targeted drug delivery systems that can be used as homing tools for these recognition sites. Targeted drug delivery systems are a promising therapeutic approach for tumor chemotherapy. Additional research focused on finding novel recognition sites, and subsequent development of targeting moieties for use with drug delivery systems will aid in the evaluation and clinical application of new and improved chemotherapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Neuropilin-1: A Multifaceted Target for Cancer Therapy.. Abstract: Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), initially identified as a neuronal guidance protein, has emerged as a multifaceted regulator in cancer biology. Beyond its role in axonal guidance and angiogenesis, NRP1 is increasingly recognized for its significant impact on tumor progression and therapeutic outcomes. This review explores the diverse functions of NRP1 in cancer, encompassing its influence on tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. NRP1 interacts with several key signaling pathways, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), semaphorins, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting angiogenesis. Moreover, NRP1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in various malignancies, underscoring its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Therapeutically, targeting NRP1 holds promise as a novel strategy to inhibit tumor growth and enhance the efficacy of regular treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Strategies involving NRP1-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and gene silencing techniques, are being actively investigated in preclinical and clinical settings. Despite challenges in specificity and delivery, advances in understanding NRP1 biology offer new avenues for personalized cancer therapy. Although several types of cancer cells can express NRPs, the role of NRPs in tumor pathogenesis is largely unknown. Future investigations are needed to enhance our understanding of the effects and mechanisms of NRPs on the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of neuronal, endothelial, and cancer cells. The novel frameworks or multi-omics approaches integrate data from multiple databases to better understand cancer's molecular and clinical features, develop personalized therapies, and help identify biomarkers. This review highlights the pivotal role of NRP1 in cancer pathogenesis and discusses its implications for developing targeted therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes, highlighting the role of OMICS in targeting cancer patients for personalized therapy.

Abstract: In the past two decades, several molecular targeted inhibitors have been developed and evaluated clinically to improve the survival of patients with cancer. Molecular targeted inhibitors inhibit the activities of pathogenic tyrosine kinases. Particularly, aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation is a potential therapeutic target. An increased understanding of genetics, cellular biology and structural biology has led to the development of numerous important therapeutics. Pathogenic RTK mutations, deletions, translocations and amplification/over-expressions have been identified and are currently being examined for their roles in cancers. Therapies targeting RTKs are categorized as small-molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Studies are underway to explore abnormalities in 20 types of RTK subfamilies in patients with cancer or other diseases. In this review, we describe representative RTKs important for developing cancer therapeutics and predicting or evaluated resistance mechanisms. Journal: International journal of molecular sciences.

Abstract: The successful multidisciplinary approach for the management of germ cell tumors of the testis has resulted in survival rates of greater than 90% overall. While the majority of relapses in patients with germ cell tumors occur within the first 2 years of treatment, the incidence of late relapse beyond 2 years has been increasing over recent years. The pattern of late relapse suggests that an inadequately controlled retroperitoneum is a major predisposing factor, with up to 80% of late relapses occurring in the retroperitoneum. These tumors tend to be chemorefractory and overall prognosis for patients with late relapse of germ cell tumors is relatively poor, with survival rates of approximately 30% to 40%. In this review, we present the recent data regarding the clinical presentation, patterns of relapse, histologic findings, appropriate treatment options, and outcomes for men with late relapse of germ cell tumors.

Abstract: Disease relapse in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), either due to development of acquired resistance after therapy or because of de novo resistance, remains a therapeutic challenge. In the present study, we have developed a cytarabine (Ara-C)-resistant REH cell line (REH/Ara-C) as a chemoresistance model. REH/Ara-C 1) was not crossresistant to vincristine or methotrexate; 2) showed a similar proliferation rate and cell surface marker expression as parental REH; 3) demonstrated decreased chemotaxis toward bone marrow stromal cells; and 4) expressed higher transcript levels of cytidine deaminase (<i>CDA</i>) and mitoNEET (<i>CISD1</i>) than the parental REH cell line. Based on these findings, we tested NL-1, a mitoNEET inhibitor, which induced a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability with a comparable IC<sub>50</sub> value in REH and REH/Ara-C. Furthermore, NL-1 decreased cell viability in six different ALL cell lines and showed inhibitory activity in a hemosphere assay. NL-1 also impaired the migratory ability of leukemic cells, irrespective of the chemoattractant used, in a chemotaxis assay. More importantly, NL-1 showed specific activity in inducing death in a drug-resistant population of leukemic cells within a coculture model that mimicked the acquired resistance and de novo resistance observed in the bone marrow of relapsed patients. Subsequent studies indicated that NL-1 mediates autophagy, and inhibition of autophagy partially decreased NL-1-induced tumor cell death. Finally, NL-1 showed antileukemic activity in an in vivo mouse ALL model. Taken together, our study demonstrates that mitoNEET has potential as a novel antileukemic drug target in treatment refractory or relapsed ALL.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Germline large genomic alterations on 7q in patients with multiple primary cancers.. Abstract: Patients with multiple primary cancers (MPCs) are suspected to have a hereditary cancer syndrome. However, only a small proportion may be explained by mutations in high-penetrance genes. We investigate two unrelated MPC patients that met Hereditary Breast and Ovaria Cancer criteria, both presenting triple negative breast tumors and no mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 genes. Germline rearrangements on chromosome 7q, involving over 40\u2009Mb of the same region, were found in both patients: one with mosaic loss (80% of cells) and the other with cnLOH (copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity) secondary to maternal allele duplication. Five children tested had no alterations on 7q. The patients shared 330 genes in common on 7q22.1-q34, including several tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) previously related to breast cancer risk and imprinted genes. The analysis of the triple negative BC from one patient revealed a mosaic gain of 7q translated for over-expressed cancer-related genes. The involvement of TSGs and imprinted genes, mapped on 7q, has the potential of being associated to MPC risk, as well as cancer progression. To our knowledge, this is the first description of patients with MPCs that harbor constitutive large alterations on 7q. Journal: Scientific reports. Year: 2017.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Death by design: where curcumin sensitizes drug-resistant tumours.. Abstract: Chemotherapy remains the core of anticancer treatment. However, despite the tremendous strides made in the development of targeted anticancer therapies, emergence of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is still a major obstacle in the successful management of resistant tumours. Therefore, profound investigation into the in-depth molecular mechanisms of drug resistance is essential and may hopefully translate into effective therapies that can flip the switch from drug resistance to susceptibility. Mechanistically, resistance phenomena may be explained by (i) overexpression of drug efflux pumps, (ii) enhanced drug detoxification, (iii) rapid DNA repair efficiency, (iv) defects in apoptosis regulation, and (v) active cell survival signals. Several adverse effects associated with multidrug resistance and the need for safe multi-targeted anticancer drugs instigated the use of the phytochemical, curcumin, the yellow pigment of the spice turmeric, which has pleotropic activities. We performed a structured literature review using PubMed and Medline searches with secondary review of cited publications, identifying studies on the role of curcumin in conquering drug resistance in cancer. This review describes how curcumin sensitizes cancer cells through regulation of multiple multidrug resistance pathways, thus employing one drug for multiple targets. Curcumin helps the cancer cells to regain their 'forgotten' apoptosis, modulates drug-target interaction at different levels, restrains survival pathways when their proteins are overexpressed, and finds an alternate way to carry forward the process of sensitization of different resistant tumours. Additionally, the review dissects the role of curcumin, if any, in targeting the major culprit of drug resistance, cancer stem cells (CSC), thereby circumventing resistance. Taken together, this review strongly suggests that curcumin is a promising chemosensitizing agent and that the unique properties of curcumin may be exploited for successful management of resistant tumours.

Abstract: At relapse, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has a worse patient outcome than B-cell precursor (BCP-) ALL. To investigate this further, we compared in vitro cellular drug resistance profiles of T-cell and BCP-ALL samples obtained at relapse. We investigated 237 paediatric relapsed ALL cases, including 151 samples taken at first relapse, of which 30 were T-cell ALL. In vitro drug resistance was measured using the 4-day methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) assay and cellular immunophenotype was determined at central reference laboratories. Similar results were found for first relapsed ALL samples and for the total group: T-cell ALL samples were more resistant to 4-HOO-ifosfamide (1.4-fold, P = 0.019) and cisplatin (3.7-fold, P = 0.005). The samples were more sensitive to thiopurines such as mercaptopurine (2.1-fold, P = 0.007) and thioguanine (1.7-fold, P = 0.003). Resistance/sensitivity to 16 other drugs did not differ significantly. These results do not explain the relatively poor prognosis of T-cell ALL at relapse, but do suggest that the more intensive use of thiopurines in relapsed T-cell ALL may be beneficial.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: High-dose ara-C and etoposide in refractory or relapsing acute leukemia.. Abstract: A total of 32 patients (15 men and 17 women) presenting with relapsing or refractory acute leukemia were treated with a 3-h infusion of 3 g/m2 cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) twice daily on days 1-6 and a 1-h infusion of 100 mg/m2 etoposide on days 1-5. In all, 6 subjects had acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL); 25 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of types M1 (n = 6), M2 (n = 10), M4 (n = 5), and M5 (n = 4); and 1 had mixed-type leukemia. The median age was 35 years (ranges, 16-62 years). Of the patients presenting with AML, 11 were primarily refractory and 3 became refractory after their first relapse. Six subjects had an early first relapse following a complete remission (CR) that lasted less than 6 months and five, a second relapse. Another patient underwent a primary relapse after greater than 6 months but had been heavily pretreated. In all, 5 subjects with refractory AML achieved a CR (36%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 10%-62%) as did 7 patients exhibiting relapsing AML (58%; CI, 30%-86%). Three patients who had relapsing or resistant ALL achieved a CR. Side effects consisted of severe hematotoxicity associated with granulocytopenia of less than 500/mm3 that lasted for a mean of 23.6 days and thrombocytopenia of less than 20,000/mm3 whose mean duration was 20.8 days. Marked gastrointestinal toxicity and infections were also prevalent. Cutaneous and ocular toxicity as well as allergic, pulmonary and cerebellar side effects were observed in a few cases. We conclude that the combination of high-dose ara-C and etoposide is a powerful but toxic induction regimen for refractory or relapsed acute leukemia. Journal: Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Genetic and Epigenetic Characteristics of Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Associated Colorectal Cancer.. Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder associated with an elevated risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). IBD-associated CRC (IBD-CRC) may represent a distinct pathway of tumorigenesis compared to sporadic CRC (sCRC). Our aim was to comprehensively characterize IBD-associated tumorigenesis integrating multiple high-throughput approaches, and to compare the results with in-house data sets from sCRCs. Whole-genome sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, RNA sequencing, genome-wide methylation analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed using fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed tissue samples of tumor and corresponding normal tissues from 31 patients with IBD-CRC. Transcriptome-based tumor subtyping revealed the complete absence of canonical epithelial tumor subtype associated with WNT signaling in IBD-CRCs, dominated instead by mesenchymal stroma-rich subtype. Negative WNT regulators AXIN2 and RNF43 were strongly down-regulated in IBD-CRCs and chromosomal gains at HNF4A, a negative regulator of WNT-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), were less frequent compared to sCRCs. Enrichment of hypomethylation at HNF4\u03b1 binding sites was detected solely in sCRC genomes. PIGR and OSMR involved in mucosal immunity were dysregulated via epigenetic modifications in IBD-CRCs. Genome-wide analysis showed significant enrichment of noncoding mutations to 5'untranslated region of TP53 in IBD-CRCs. As reported previously, somatic mutations in APC and KRAS were less frequent in IBD-CRCs compared to sCRCs. Distinct mechanisms of WNT pathway dysregulation skew IBD-CRCs toward mesenchymal tumor subtype, which may affect prognosis and treatment options. Increased OSMR signaling may favor the establishment of mesenchymal tumors in patients with IBD. Journal: Gastroenterology. Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Comprehensive multi-omics analysis identifies transferrin receptor as a therapeutic target in esophageal cancer.. Abstract: This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers for esophageal cancer (ESCA) through multi-omics approaches and to explore their roles in disease progression. We analyzed the cellular heterogeneity of ESCA samples using single-cell RNA sequencing data, and transcriptomic analysis revealed differentially expressed genes between ESCA and normal tissues. By integrating gene expression quantitative trait loci analysis with genome-wide association studies, we identified the key gene transferrin receptor (TFRC) as being associated with ESCA. Both pan-cancer and ESCA-specific analyses indicated that increased TFRC expression is linked to poor prognosis and drug metabolism. Additionally, high TFRC expression was associated with reduced immune cell infiltration and downregulation of immune checkpoint genes. Multiplexed immunofluorescence assays further revealed that elevated TFRC expression is associated with immune evasion, negatively correlating with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and positively correlating with M2 macrophage infiltration. Furthermore, our findings support a model in which TFRC modulates iron availability to influence the survival and activity of tumor cells, rather than primarily driving lipid peroxidation or ferroptosis. TFRC knockdown enhanced M1 macrophage polarization and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. The differential expression of TFRC in the tumor epithelium and stroma highlights its significant role in immune evasion. In conclusion, TFRC plays a critical role in the development of ESCA and its immune escape mechanisms, suggesting that it may serve as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: The advent of novel immunotherapies in the treatment of cancers has dramatically changed the landscape of the oncology field. Recent developments in checkpoint inhibition therapies, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapies, chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies, and cancer vaccines have shown immense promise for significant advancements in cancer treatments. Immunotherapies act on distinct steps of immune response to augment the body's natural ability to recognize, target, and destroy cancerous cells. Combination treatments with immunotherapies and other modalities intend to activate immune response, decrease immunosuppression, and target signaling and resistance pathways to offer a more durable, long-lasting treatment compared to traditional therapies and immunotherapies as monotherapies for cancers. This review aims to briefly describe the rationale, mechanisms of action, and clinical efficacy of common immunotherapies and highlight promising combination strategies currently approved or under clinical development. Additionally, we will discuss the benefits and limitations of these immunotherapy approaches as monotherapies as well as in combination with other treatments.

Abstract: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the top 10 most common cancers in both men and women with an estimated 75 000 cases each year in the US. Over the last decade, the therapeutic landscape for patients with metastatic RCC has significantly evolved, with immunotherapy emerging as the new front-line therapy. Despite significant improvement in toxicity profile and survival outcomes, key concerns such as patient selection, treatment sequencing, and intrinsic and acquired resistance remain unresolved. Emerging options such as antibody-based therapeutics (eg, anti-CD70, anti-CA9, and anti-ENPP3) are being explored in clinical trials for patients with cancer resistant or refractory to current immunotherapies. Despite positive results for hematological cancers, breast cancer, and more recently bladder cancer, most antibody-based therapies failed to improve the outcomes in patients with advanced RCC. This underscores the need to understand the underlying causes of failed responses to this treatment class, which will ultimately support the rational design of more effective and tolerable treatments. In this review, we summarize the evolving landscape of RCC therapeutics and describe recent clinical trials with emerging antibody-based therapeutics. We also describe the challenges that need to be overcome for the successful creation of therapeutic antibodies for treating RCC. Journal: The oncologist. Year: 2023.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The Obesity-Related Metabolic Gene HSD17B8 Protects Against Breast Cancer: High RNA/Protein Expression Means a Better Prognosis.. Abstract: BACKGROUND The incidence of breast cancer is increasing annually. Obesity and metabolism are considered risk factors for breast cancer. Discovery of obesity- and metabolism-related breast cancer prognostic genes is imminent. MATERIAL AND METHODS We screened metabolism-related genes (MRG) from KEGG and downloaded the obese female dataset GSE151839 from GEO, which screened differentially-expressed genes (DEGs), seen as female obesity-related genes. The intersection of MRGs and DEGs was obesity-related metabolic genes (OMGs), verified by enrichment analysis. After downloading breast cancer data from TCGA, univariate Cox regression and log-rank P analyses were used to screen hub OMGs related to breast cancer prognosis. ROC curve and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter, GEPIA, and GENT2 databases were used to verify the hub OMGs at the RNA level. CPTAC and HLA databases were used to verify the hub OMGs at the protein level. RESULTS We screened 33 OMGs. The results of univariate Cox regression and log-rank P analysis showed 3 of 33 OMGs (ABCA1, LPIN1, HSD17B8) were associated with the prognosis of breast cancer patients. After verification with ROC, KM-plotter, and GEPIA, only HSD17B8 was related to breast cancer prognosis (overall/disease-free survival). Results of GENT2 showed the RNA expression of HSD17B8 in breast cancer subtypes with poor prognosis is significantly lower than that with good prognosis. Results of CPTAC and HLA databases showed that the protein expression level of HSD17B8 in breast cancer tissues was significantly lower than that in adjacent normal tissues. CONCLUSIONS HSD17B8 is a protective gene against breast cancer. The higher the expression of HSD17B8, the better the prognosis of breast cancer patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Identification of novel protein biomarkers and drug targets for colorectal cancer by integrating human plasma proteome with genome.. Abstract: The proteome is a major source of therapeutic targets. We conducted a proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to identify candidate protein markers and therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer (CRC). Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were derived from seven published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on plasma proteome, and summary-level data were extracted for 4853 circulating protein markers. Genetic associations with CRC were obtained from a large-scale GWAS meta-analysis (16,871 cases and 26,328 controls), the FinnGen cohort (4957 cases and 304,197 controls), and the UK Biobank (9276 cases and 477,069 controls). Colocalization and summary-data-based MR (SMR) analyses were performed sequentially to verify the causal role of candidate proteins. Single cell-type expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI), and druggability evaluation were further conducted to detect the specific cell type with enrichment expression and prioritize potential therapeutic targets. Collectively, genetically predicted levels of 13 proteins were associated with CRC risk. Elevated levels of two proteins (GREM1, CHRDL2) and decreased levels of 11 proteins were associated with an increased risk of CRC, among which four (GREM1, CLSTN3, CSF2RA, CD86) were prioritized with the most convincing evidence. These protein-coding genes are mainly expressed in tissue stem cells, epithelial cells, and monocytes in colon tumor tissue. Two interactive pairs of proteins (GREM1 and CHRDL2; MMP2 and TIMP2) were identified to be involved in osteoclast differentiation and tumorigenesis pathways; four proteins (POLR2F, CSF2RA, CD86, MMP2) have been targeted for drug development on autoimmune diseases and other cancers, with the potentials of being repurposed as therapeutic targets for CRC. This study identified several protein biomarkers to be associated with CRC risk and provided new insights into the etiology and promising targets for the development of screening biomarkers and therapeutic drugs for CRC.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The Multifaceted Role of Striatin-interacting Protein 2 (STRIP2) in Disease Pathogenesis and Cancer Progression.. Abstract: Striatin-interacting protein 2 (STRIP2), encoded by the STRIP2 gene, plays a critical role in various biological processes. It is an integral part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex and is involved in cell growth, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In this review, we explored the multifaceted functions of STRIP2 across different cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and others. We searched the PubMed database for studies investigating STRIP2 in tumors or pathological processes. Our search yielded 30 studies. After meticulous screening, only 14 studies were included in this review. Based on our results, STRIP2 is overexpressed and amplified in multiple cancer types, including NSCLC, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis. In NSCLC, it promotes tumor progression through mechanisms involving mRNA stabilization, Akt/mTOR pathway, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and immune regulation. In breast and colorectal cancers, elevated STRIP2 levels correlate with reduced overall survival. In prostate cancer, STRIP2 contributes to cell migration and cytoskeletal organization. Furthermore, interaction of STRIP2 with immune checkpoint genes suggests its role in tumor immune evasion, offering therapeutic potential for targeting the tumor microenvironment. We conclude that STRIP2 acts as an oncogene in various tumors and is associated with a poor prognosis. It is involved in critical oncogenic pathways including proliferation, EMT, and immune regulation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. This review supports the importance of investigating the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic role of STRIP2 in various cancers, particularly NSCLC. Journal: Anticancer research. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting the Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer.. Abstract: The treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer still remains challenging, and identification of new target molecules and therapeutic avenues remains a priority. The great majority of colorectal cancers have mutations in one of two genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway: the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and \u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1) genes. Up to now, however, no therapeutics for targeting this pathway have been established. This review article begins with a brief summary of Wnt signaling from the viewpoints of genetics, cancer stem cell biology, and drug development. We then overview current attempts to develop drugs directed at various components of the Wnt signaling pathway. APC is a tumor suppressor, and therefore only downstream signal transducers of the APC protein can be considered as targets for pharmaceutical intervention. TRAF2 and NCK-interacting protein kinase (TNIK) was identified as the most downstream regulator of Wnt signaling by two independent research groups, and several classes of small-molecule inhibitors targeting this protein kinase have been developed. TNIK is a multifunctional protein with actions that extend beyond Wnt signaling regulation. Such TNIK inhibitors are expected to have a large variety of clinical applications.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Advanced targeted therapies in cancer: Drug nanocarriers, the future of chemotherapy.. Abstract: Cancer is the second worldwide cause of death, exceeded only by cardiovascular diseases. It is characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation and an absence of cell death that, except for hematological cancers, generates an abnormal cell mass or tumor. This primary tumor grows thanks to new vascularization and, in time, acquires metastatic potential and spreads to other body sites, which causes metastasis and finally death. Cancer is caused by damage or mutations in the genetic material of the cells due to environmental or inherited factors. While surgery and radiotherapy are the primary treatment used for local and non-metastatic cancers, anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy, hormone and biological therapies) are the choice currently used in metastatic cancers. Chemotherapy is based on the inhibition of the division of rapidly growing cells, which is a characteristic of the cancerous cells, but unfortunately, it also affects normal cells with fast proliferation rates, such as the hair follicles, bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract cells, generating the characteristic side effects of chemotherapy. The indiscriminate destruction of normal cells, the toxicity of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, as well as the development of multidrug resistance, support the need to find new effective targeted treatments based on the changes in the molecular biology of the tumor cells. These novel targeted therapies, of increasing interest as evidenced by FDA-approved targeted cancer drugs in recent years, block biologic transduction pathways and/or specific cancer proteins to induce the death of cancer cells by means of apoptosis and stimulation of the immune system, or specifically deliver chemotherapeutic agents to cancer cells, minimizing the undesirable side effects. Although targeted therapies can be achieved directly by altering specific cell signaling by means of monoclonal antibodies or small molecules inhibitors, this review focuses on indirect targeted approaches that mainly deliver chemotherapeutic agents to molecular targets overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells. In particular, we offer a detailed description of different cytotoxic drug carriers, such as liposomes, carbon nanotubes, dendrimers, polymeric micelles, polymeric conjugates and polymeric nanoparticles, in passive and active targeted cancer therapy, by enhancing the permeability and retention or by the functionalization of the surface of the carriers, respectively, emphasizing those that have received FDA approval or are part of the most important clinical studies up to date. These drug carriers not only transport the chemotherapeutic agents to tumors, avoiding normal tissues and reducing toxicity in the rest of the body, but also protect cytotoxic drugs from degradation, increase the half-life, payload and solubility of cytotoxic agents and reduce renal clearance. Despite the many advantages of all the anticancer drug carriers analyzed, only a few of them have reached the FDA approval, in particular, two polymer-protein conjugates, five liposomal formulations and one polymeric nanoparticle are available in the market, in contrast to the sixteen FDA approval of monoclonal antibodies. However, there are numerous clinical trials in progress of polymer-protein and polymer-drug conjugates, liposomal formulations, including immunoliposomes, polymeric micelles and polymeric nanoparticles. Regarding carbon nanotubes or dendrimers, there are no FDA approvals or clinical trials in process up to date due to their unresolved toxicity. Moreover, we analyze in detail the more promising and advanced preclinical studies of the particular case of polymeric nanoparticles as carriers of different cytotoxic agents to active and passive tumor targeting published in the last 5 years, since they have a huge potential in cancer therapy, being one of the most widely studied nano-platforms in this field in the last years. The interest that these formulations have recently achieved is stressed by the fact that 90% of the papers based on cancer therapeutics with polymeric nanoparticles have been published in the last 6 years (PubMed search).

Abstract: Angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer progression and as such has been considered a target of therapeutic interest. However, single targeted agents have not fully lived up to the initial promise of anti-angiogenic therapy. Therefore, it has been suggested that combining therapies and agents will be the way forward in the oncology field. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have received considerable attention as drivers of tumor development and progression, either acting as tumor suppressors or as oncogenes (so-called oncomiRs), as well as in the process of tumor angiogenesis (angiomiRs). Not only from a functional, but also from a therapeutic view, miRNAs are attractive tools. Thus far, several mimics and antagonists of miRNAs have entered clinical development. Here, we review the provenance and promise of miRNAs as targets as well as therapeutics to contribute to anti-angiogenesis-based (combination) treatment of cancer. Journal: Angiogenesis. Year: 2017.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment by the Hippo Pathway: Implications for cancer immunotherapy.. Abstract: The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a dynamic and complex ecosystem consisting of immune cells, stromal cells, and tumor cells. It plays a crucial role in shaping cancer progression and treatment outcomes. Notably, tumor-associated immune cells are key regulators within the TIME, influencing immune responses and therapeutic efficacy. The Hippo pathway is a critical signaling pathway involved in the TIME and cancer progression. In this review, we provide an overview of the Hippo pathway's role in the TIME, focusing on its interactions with immune cells and their implications in cancer biology and therapy. Specifically, we discuss the involvement of the Hippo pathway in regulating T-cell function, macrophage polarization, B-cell differentiation, MDSC activity, and dendritic cell-mediated immune responses. Furthermore, we explore its influence on PD-L1 expression in lymphocytes and its potential as a therapeutic target. While recent progress has been made in understanding the Hippo pathway's molecular mechanisms, challenges remain in deciphering its context-dependent effects in different cancers and identifying predictive biomarkers for targeted therapies. By elucidating the intricate crosstalk between the Hippo pathway and the TME, we aim to contribute to the development of innovative strategies for cancer treatment.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Slow-cycling (dormant) cancer cells in therapy resistance, cancer relapse and metastasis.. Abstract: It is increasingly appreciated that cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity constitute major barriers to effective clinical treatments and long-term therapeutic efficacy. Research in the past two decades suggest that virtually all treatment-naive human cancers harbor subsets of cancer cells that possess many of the cardinal features of normal stem cells. Such stem-like cancer cells, operationally defined as cancer stem cells (CSCs), are frequently quiescent and dynamically change and evolve during tumor progression and therapeutic interventions. Intrinsic tumor cell heterogeneity is reflected in a different aspect in that tumors also harbor a population of slow-cycling cells (SCCs) that are not in the proliferative cell cycle and thus are intrinsically refractory to anti-mitotic drugs. In this Perspective, we focus our discussions on SCCs in cancer and on various methodologies that can be employed to enrich and purify SCCs, compare the similarities and differences between SCCs, CSCs and cancer cells undergoing EMT, and present evidence for the involvement of SCCs in surviving anti-neoplastic treatments, mediating tumor relapse, maintaining tumor dormancy and mediating metastatic dissemination. Our discussions make it clear that an in-depth understanding of the biological properties of SCCs in cancer will be instrumental to developing new therapeutic strategies to prevent tumor relapse and distant metastasis.

Abstract: The genesis and progression of tumors are multifaceted processes influenced by genetic mutations within the tumor cells and the dynamic interplay with their surrounding milieu, which incessantly impacts the course of cancer. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic entity that encompasses not only the tumor cells but also an array of non-cancerous cells, signaling molecules, and the extracellular matrix. This intricate network is crucial in tumor progression, metastasis, and response to treatments. The TME is populated by diverse cell types, including immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, alongside cytokines and growth factors, all of which play roles in either suppressing or fostering tumor growth. Grasping the nuances of the interactions within the TME is vital for the advancement of targeted cancer therapies. Consequently, a thorough understanding of the alterations of TME and the identification of upstream regulatory targets have emerged as a research priority. NF-\u03baB transcription factors, central to inflammation and innate immunity, are increasingly recognized for their significant role in cancer onset and progression. This review emphasizes the crucial influence of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway within the TME, underscoring its roles in the development and advancement of cancer. By examining the interactions between NF-\u03baB and various components of the TME, targeting the NF-\u03baB pathway appears as a promising cancer treatment approach.

Abstract: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a major challenge for the effective delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain tumor cells from the peripheral blood circulation, making the treatment of central nervous system (CNS)-related cancers more difficult and resistant to both standard treatments and emerging therapies. Exosomes, which serve as messengers for intercellular communication throughout the body, can naturally or be modified to penetrate the BBB. Recently, exosomes have been increasingly explored as an invasive or non-invasive approach for delivering therapeutic agents to the CNS. With their low immunogenicity, ease of modification, excellent cargo protection, and inherent ability to cross the BBB, exosomes hold great promise for revolutionizing targeted therapy for CNS-related diseases, including brain cancer. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries and insights into the mechanisms exosomes use to penetrate the BBB, the methods they employ to payload diverse therapeutics, and their roles in transporting therapeutic compounds for brain cancer and other neurological disorders.

Abstract: Cancer, a leading cause of global mortality, is characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation and remains a significant therapeutic challenge due to drug resistance and treatment failures. Despite advancements in targeted therapies, novel agents are still in strong demand. Benzosuberane, a bicyclic scaffold present in natural products such as colchicine and theaflavin, has emerged as a promising structural core in cancer therapeutics due to its structural flexibility and diverse biological activities, including antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects. This review consolidates the computational insights driving the design of benzosuberane-based compounds as effective antitumor agents. Focusing on molecular docking studies, it highlights the interaction profiles with various target classes, including antivascular agents, kinase inhibitors, receptor modulators, and DNA-intercalators. These interactions regulate critical oncogenic pathways, offering mechanistic details that highlight the compounds' potential for enhanced specificity and therapeutic efficacy. Among the cancer targets, benzosuberane-based compounds acting as antivascular agents and DNA-targeting agents emerged as the most promising, based on consistent binding affinities, cytotoxicity, and binding interaction profiles across breast, lung, and colon cancer cell lines. By summarizing the structural and molecular requirements for benzosuberane-mediated modulation of cancer pathway and identifying promising compounds, this work aims to guide future research and advance drug discovery pipelines.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Therapeutic targets in the Wnt signaling pathway: Treating cancer with specificity.. Abstract: The Wnt signaling pathway is a critical regulatory mechanism that governs cell cycle progression, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, stemness, and the tumor immune microenvironment, while also maintaining tissue homeostasis. Dysregulated activation of this pathway is implicated in various cancers, closely linked to tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin axis plays a central role in the pathogenesis of common cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), breast cancer (BC), liver cancer, and lung cancer. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, targeted therapy offers a more precise approach to cancer treatment. As a key regulator of oncogenesis, the Wnt pathway represents a promising target for clinical interventions. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the Wnt signaling pathway, exploring its roles in tumor biology and its implications in human malignancies. It further examines the molecular mechanisms and modes of action across different cancers, detailing how the Wnt pathway contributes to tumor progression through mechanisms such as metastasis promotion, immune modulation, drug resistance, and enhanced cellular proliferation. Finally, therapeutic strategies targeting Wnt pathway components are discussed, including inhibitors targeting extracellular members, as well as those within the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. The potential of these targets in the development of novel therapeutic agents underscores the critical importance of intervening in the Wnt signaling pathway for effective cancer treatment.

Abstract: Hepatobiliary malignancies encompass a spectrum of invasive carcinomas arising in the liver [hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), bile ducts [intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHC)] and the gallbladder. These malignancies represent a growing global health burden, with rising incidence and mortality rates and their overall prognosis remains poor because many patients present with advanced unresectable disease at diagnosis. In recent years, significant advancements in understanding HCC immunogenicity have reshaped the therapeutic scenario of advanced HCC with the immunotherapy revolutionizing the current HCC treatment landscape and patients' prognosis. Moreover, the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy has recently established a new standard of care first-line treatment for patients with biliary tract cancers (BTCs) who had historically few therapeutic options. Currently, immunotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based regimens stand as a valuable and practice-changing options in both HCC and BTC management. The mounting recent evidence supporting immunotherapy's survival benefit demands clinicians to stay updated with a rapidly evolving treatment landscape as well as gain knowledge about patient selection, response rate compared with other systemic treatments and immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs) management. A panel of international Experts, comprising hepatologists and oncologists, gathered to explore the challenges in effectively integrating immunotherapy in routine clinical practice. The aim of this review is to present the Experts' insights to inform treatment choice in HCC and BTC with a special emphasis on the role of currently available ICI-based therapies in shifting treatment paradigms and potentially reversing the natural course of these two deadly malignancies.

Abstract: Helicobacter pylori (Hp) markedly elevates the risk of gastric cancer (GC) through the induction of chronic inflammation, which facilitates the accumulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the immune microenvironment of GC. CAFs contribute to the progression of GC and adversely affect subsequent therapeutic outcomes for patients. However, there is a paucity of research concerning the impact of Hp on CAFs or the identification of potential targets for therapeutic intervention. We analyzed public microRNA and transcriptome sequencing data to identify key microRNAs and signaling pathways in Hp\u2009+\u2009GC. We also used single-cell sequencing to explore cellular localization and interaction mechanisms. Molecular biology experiments, in vitro cell co-culture, and in vivo cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models validated our findings and assessed the pathway's impact on GC proliferation and therapeutic potential. We identified the \"TLR/miR-148a-5p/CALD1/collagen VI\" signaling pathway in Hp-stimulated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a critical signaling pathway influencing the proliferation of Hp\u2009+\u2009GC. These CAFs contributed to GC cell proliferation by releasing substantial amounts of collagen VI, which interacted with tumoral SDC4 receptors. Administration of miR-148a-5p agomir in vivo effectively inhibited the proliferative effects and concurrently enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy in Hp\u2009+\u2009GC mice models. Hp-stimulated CAFs played a significant role in promoting tumor proliferation in Hp\u2009+\u2009GC. Targeting its \"TLR/miR-148a-5p/CALD1/collagen VI\" pathway was a promising method to ease the collagen-rich microenvironment and inhibit the proliferation of GC cells. Furthermore, miR-148a-5p agomir might serve as a safer and more efficacious chemotherapeutic sensitizer for patients with Hp\u2009+\u2009GC. Journal: Cellular oncology (Dordrecht, Netherlands).

Abstract: In this study, we identified prognostic biomarkers for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) by integrating multiple sets of DNA copy number variants (CNV) and methylation variant (MET) data, and performing qPCR and immunohistochemical identification. We examined the expression of CNV and MET in 368 LUSC patients. Gene expression associated with DNA copy number or DNA methylation was identified and four LUSC gene subtypes were defined based on these correlations. The prognosis overall survival (OS) of the iC1 subtype was significantly lower than that in the iC2 and iC4 subtypes. We assessed the immune scores of each subtype and found that the six immune cell scores of the iC3 subtype were significantly higher than the other subtypes (p < 0.01). Three genes associated with prognosis, NFE2L2, ASAH2, and RIMBP2, were identified by comparing the expression of CNV and MET in subtypes. Analysis of mutational differences between subtypes revealed a group of genes with significant mutations between the iC1 and iC4 subtypes. The number of mutations in the NFE2L2 gene in LUSC was significantly higher than that in other genes, and the gene was prognostic. The number of mutations was significantly higher in the best iC4 subtype than the iC1 subtype with the worst prognosis; the other two genes, ASAH2 and RIMBP2, were only found in the worst prognosis of the iC1 subtype. This comprehensive multi-omics analysis of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics data provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of LUSC and may be helpful in identifying biomolecular markers for early disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Novel agents have expanded the traditional HER2 definitions to include HER2-Low (HER2L) Breast Cancer (BC). We sought to evaluate the distinct molecular characteristics of HER2L BC to understand potential clinical/biologic factors driving resistance and clinical outcomes. Retrospective analysis was performed on 13,613 BC samples, tested at Caris Life Sciences via NextGen DNA/RNA Sequencing. BC subtypes were defined by IHC/ISH. CODEai database was used to access clinical outcomes from insurance claims data. Overall, mutational landscape was similar between HER2L and classical subsets of HR+and HRneg cohorts.\u00a0TP53\u00a0mutations were significantly higher in HRneg/HER2L group vs. HR+/HER2L tumors (p<0.001). A higher mutation rate of\u00a0PIK3CA\u00a0was observed in HRneg/HER2L tumors compared to TNBC subtype (p=0.016). PD-L1 positivity was elevated in HRneg/HER2L tumors compared to HR+/HER2L tumors, all\u00a0p<0.01. Patients with HR+/HER2L tumors treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors had similar OS compared to pts with HR+/HER2-0 (HR=0.89,\u00a0p=0.012). 27.2% of HR+/HER2L pts had activating\u00a0PIK3CA\u00a0mutations. Among HR+PIK3CA\u00a0mutated tumors, HER2L pts treated with alpelisib showed no difference in OS vs. HER2-0 alpelisib-treated pts (HR=1.23,\u00a0p=0.517). 13.9% of HER2L TNBC pts were PD-L1<sup>+</sup>. Interestingly, pts with PD-L1<sup>+</sup>\u00a0HER2L/HRneg (TNBC) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) showed improved OS than HER2-0 TNBC (HR=0.61, p=0.046). Our findings expand the understanding of the molecular profile of the HER2L subgroup and comparison to the classically defined breast cancer subgroups. Genomic risk assessments after progression on novel therapeutics can be assessed to better define implications for mechanisms of resistance. Journal: Breast cancer research and treatment. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most lethal cancers among all gynecological malignancies. An effective and non-invasive screening approach is needed urgently to reduce high mortality rate. The purpose of this study was to identify the salivary protein signatures (SPS) for non-invasive detection of ovarian cancer. Differentially expressed SPS were identified by fluorescence-based 2D-DIGE coupled with MALDI/TOF-MS. The expression levels of three differential proteins (Lipocalin-2, indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase1 (IDO1) and S100A8) were validated using western blotting and ELISA. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR were performed in an independent cohort of ovarian tumor tissues. 25 over expressed and 19 under expressed (p<0.05) proteins between healthy controls and cancer patients were identified. Lipocalin-2, IDO1 and S100A8 were selected for initial verification and successfully verified by immunoassay. Diagnostic potential of the candidate biomarkers was evaluated by ROC analysis. The selected biomarkers were further validated by immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of ovarian tissues. The global expression of selected targets was also analyzed by microarray and validated using qRT-PCR to strengthen our hypothesis. Tumor secreted proteins identified by 'dual-omics' strategy, whose concentration are significantly high in ovarian cancer patients have obvious potential to be used as screening biomarker after large scale validation.

Abstract: Recent clinical successes with immunotherapy have resulted in expanding indications for cancer therapy. To enhance antitumor immune responses, and to better choose specific strategies matched to patient and tumor characteristics, genomic-driven precision immunotherapy will be necessary. Herein, we explore the role that tumor gene-expression profiling (GEP) may have in the prediction of an immunotherapeutic response. Genetic markers associated with response to immunotherapy are addressed as they pertain to the tumor genomic landscape, the extent of DNA damage, tumor mutational load and tumor-specific neoantigens. Furthermore, genetic markers associated with resistance to checkpoint blockade and relapse are reviewed. Finally, the utility of GEP to identify new tumor types for immunotherapy and implications for combinatorial strategies are summarized. Journal: Cancer gene therapy. Year: 2017.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The role of immunotherapy in targeting tumor microenvironment in genitourinary cancers.. Abstract: Genitourinary (GU) cancers, including renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and testicular cancer, represent a significant health burden and are among the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advancements in traditional treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, the complex interplay within the tumor microenvironment (TME) poses substantial hurdles to achieving durable remission and cure. The TME, characterized by its dynamic and multifaceted nature, comprises various cell types, signaling molecules, and the extracellular matrix, all of which are instrumental in cancer progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Recent breakthroughs in immunotherapy (IO) have opened a new era in the management of GU cancers, offering renewed hope by leveraging the body's immune system to combat cancer more selectively and effectively. This approach, distinct from conventional therapies, aims to disrupt cancer's ability to evade immune detection through mechanisms such as checkpoint inhibition, therapeutic vaccines, and adoptive cell transfer therapies. These strategies highlight the shift towards personalized medicine, emphasizing the importance of understanding the intricate dynamics within the TME for the development of targeted treatments. This article provides an in-depth overview of the current landscape of treatment strategies for GU cancers, with a focus on IO targeting the specific cell types of TME. By exploring the roles of various cell types within the TME and their impact on cancer progression, this review aims to underscore the transformative potential of IO strategies in TME targeting, offering more effective and personalized treatment options for patients with GU cancers, thereby improving outcomes and quality of life.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Getting the right combination to break the epigenetic code.. Abstract: Rapid advances in the field of epigenetics have facilitated the development of novel therapeutics targeting epigenetic mechanisms that are hijacked by cancer cells to support tumour growth and progression. Several epigenetic agents have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer; however, the efficacy of these drugs is dependent on the underlying biology and drivers of the disease, with inherent differences between solid tumours and haematological malignancies. The efficacy of epigenetic drugs as single agents remains limited across most cancer types, which has spurred the clinical development of combination therapies, with the hope of attaining synergistic activity and/or overcoming treatment resistance. In this Review we discuss clinical advances that have been achieved with the use of epigenetic agents in combination with chemotherapies, immunotherapies or other targeted agents, including epigenetic-epigenetic combinations, as well as limitations and challenges associated with these combinatorial strategies. So far, the success of combination therapies targeting epigenetic mechanisms has generally been confined to haematological malignancies, with limited efficacy observed in patients with solid tumours. Nevertheless, this Review captures the field of epigenetic combination therapies across the spectra of haematology and oncology, highlighting opportunities for precision therapy to effectively harness the potential of epigenetic agents and produce meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: GPSai: A Clinically Validated AI Tool for Tissue of Origin Prediction during Routine Tumor Profiling.. Abstract: A subset of cancers present with unclear or potentially incorrect primary histopathologic diagnoses, including cancers of unknown primary (CUP). We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Genomic Probability Score AI (GPSai\u2122), which predicts tumor tissue of origin in CUP and flags potential misdiagnoses for additional workup during routine molecular testing. The GPSai model was trained on whole exome and whole transcriptome data from 201,612 cases submitted for tumor profiling at Caris Life Sciences. Retrospective (N = 21,549) and prospective (N = 76,271) validations were performed. The clinical impact was evaluated over 8 months of live testing and through physician surveys. GPSai demonstrated 95.0% accuracy in non-CUP cases and reported on tumor tissue of origin in 84.0% of CUP and 96.3% of non-CUP cases. During the initial 8 months of implementation, GPSai changed the diagnosis on 704 patients (0.88% of all profiled cases), which were supported by orthogonal evidence including imaging, IHC, mutational signatures, hallmark fusions, or viral reads. Diagnosis changes prompted changes in targeted therapy eligibility based on level 1 clinical evidence in 86.1% of cases (n = 606/704). A majority (89.7%; n = 87/97) of physician responses indicated acceptance of the GPSai results, and 53.6% (n = 52/97) of responses stated that the results prompted a change in treatment plan. GPSai accurately identifies tumor tissue of origin and has the potential for clinical impact in a small but meaningful subset of patients with CUP or pathologically ambiguous tumors. Our results support the integration of this AI tool into routine molecular testing to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide subsequent therapeutic decisions. Our findings show that GPSai, a deep learning-based tool, can support the identification of primary tumor sites with high accuracy in conjunction with orthogonal evidence. Its integration into routine tumor profiling furthermore allows simultaneous biomarker identification. Analysis of real-world implementation of GPSai shows that it enhances diagnostic accuracy, including resolution of CUP cases, and prompts clinically relevant therapeutic recommendation changes without requiring additional specimen.

Abstract: Mutations in cohesin genes have been described in numerous solid cancers and hematologic malignancies; subsequent experimental evidence has linked these mutations with carcinogenesis. Areas covered: In this review, we present current information about the physiological role of the cohesin complex in normal and malignant cells and describe current therapeutic strategies that are being explored in cohesin-mutated cancers. We discuss a range of targets and strategies that should be explored to develop targeted therapies for patients with aberrant cohesin. Expert opinion: Targeting of the cohesin complex is an underexplored area of drug development. There is a high frequency of cohesin mutations in multiple cancers, hence specific targeting strategies should be explored. Cohesins play a crucial role in cellular organization; therefore, we expect a narrow therapeutic window of direct inhibitors of cohesin components. Exploiting experimental approaches that correct dysfunctional cohesins and coupling them with current therapeutic strategies can provide novel, innovative and more effective treatment regimens.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Relapsing intracranial germ cell tumours warrant retreatment.. Abstract: The optimal therapeutic strategy for relapsing intracranial germ cell tumours (IGCTs) has not been clearly established. Relapses of IGCTs, occurring from 01/01/1990 to 31/12/2014, were retrieved from the Societe Fran\u00e7aise d'Oncologie Pediatrique-TGM 90, 92\u00a0and GCT 96 protocols, and from the National Childhood Solid Tumour Registry. Refractory IGCTs were excluded. Forty-four relapsing IGCTs were identified: 14 were initially treated for histologically proven germinomas (germinoma group), 5 for non-histologically proven germinomas (putative germinoma group)\u00a0and 25 for non-germinomatous germ cell tumours (NGGCTs) (NGGCT group). In the germinoma group, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 79% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47-93) and 86% (95% CI: 54-96), respectively. Only one of the 11 patients treated with reirradiation experienced a further relapse. A trend of better EFS was observed for relapses at sites that were not initially involved: 5-year EFS of 100% versus 67% (95% CI: 28-88), p\u00a0=\u00a00.09. In the putative germinoma group, 4 of 5 patients experienced a further event, leading to 2 deaths. In the NGGCT group, the 5-year EFS and OS were 56% (95% CI: 35-73) and 60% (95% CI: 38-76), respectively. A significant improvement in outcomes after high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) was observed: 5-year OS of 72% (95% CI: 46-87) versus 29% (95% CI: 4-61), p\u00a0=\u00a00.006. Relapsing germinomas are highly curable; reirradiation appears to play a key role. Histological proof at initial diagnosis if markers are negative is crucial. Despite inferior outcomes relapsing, NGGCTs can be cured in a significant proportion of cases provided intensive treatment including HDC is applied.

Abstract: Malignant tumors remain a major threat to global human health. This study aimed to systematically integrate multi-omics data to identify a candidate gene with biomarker potential across diverse cancer types and to evaluate its possible clinical applications in oncology. We first performed Mendelian randomization based on summary statistics to integrate blood expression quantitative trait loci data with genome-wide association study results from esophageal adenocarcinoma, stomach cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. A comprehensive series of multi-omics bioinformatics analyses was subsequently conducted to assess the gene's expression patterns, genomic alterations, prognostic relevance, and associations with the tumor microenvironment (TME) across various cancer types. In addition, single-cell transcriptome data were analyzed to explore the gene's functional roles in the TME. The key findings were further validated through <i>in vitro</i> experiments. Mendelian randomization identified peptidylprolyl isomerase H (PPIH) as a potential biomarker across multiple malignancies. Single-cell transcriptome analysis suggested that this gene may enhance the proliferative ability of malignant cells and participate in communication between immune and stromal components in the TME. Multi-omics analyses revealed that the gene is abnormally expressed and significantly correlated with patient prognosis in several cancer types. Consistently, <i>in vitro</i> assays demonstrated that increased expression of PPIH promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This study highlights PPIH as a candidate biomarker with pan-cancer relevance and potential clinical value. These findings offer new directions for cancer diagnosis and provide a foundation for further development of targeted therapeutic approaches. Journal: Frontiers in immunology. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecularly targeted therapies for p53-mutant cancers.. Abstract: The tumor suppressor p53 is lost or mutated in approximately half of human cancers. Mutant p53 not only loses its anti-tumor transcriptional activity, but also often acquires oncogenic functions to promote tumor proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance. Traditional strategies have been taken to directly target p53 mutants through identifying small molecular compounds to deplete mutant p53, or to restore its tumor suppressive function. Accumulating evidence suggest that cancer cells with mutated p53 often exhibit specific functional dependencies on secondary genes or pathways to survive, providing alternative targets to indirectly treat p53-mutant cancers. Targeting these genes or pathways, critical for survival in the presence of p53 mutations, holds great promise for cancer treatment. In addition, mutant p53 often exhibits novel gain-of-functions to promote tumor growth and metastasis. Here, we review and discuss strategies targeting mutant p53, with focus on targeting the mutant p53 protein directly, and on the progress of identifying genes and pathways required in p53-mutant cells.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Overcoming Resistance to Combination Radiation-Immunotherapy: A Focus on Contributing Pathways Within the Tumor Microenvironment.. Abstract: Radiation therapy has been used for many years to treat tumors based on its DNA-damage-mediated ability to kill cells. More recently, RT has been shown to exert beneficial modulatory effects on immune responses, such as triggering immunogenic cell death, enhancing antigen presentation, and activating cytotoxic T cells. Consequently, combining radiation therapy with immunotherapy represents an important area of research. Thus far, immune-checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) have been the focus of many research studies and clinical trials. The available data suggest that such immunotherapies are enhanced when combined with radiation therapy. However, treatment resistance, intrinsic or acquired, is still prevalent. Various theories as to how to enhance these combination therapies to overcome treatment resistance have been proposed. In this review, we focus on the principles surrounding radiation therapy's positive and negative effects on the tumor microenvironment. We explore mechanisms underlying radiation therapy's synergistic and antagonistic effects on immune responses and provide a base of knowledge for radio-immunology combination therapies to overcome treatment resistance. We provide evidence for targeting regulatory T cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts in combination radio-immunotherapies to improve cancer treatment.

Abstract: To determine, in the setting of advanced-stage of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), whether relapses occur in the irradiated planning target volume and whether the definition of local radiation therapy (RT) used by the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) is adequate, because there is no harmonization of field and volume definitions among the large cooperative groups in the treatment of advanced-stage HL. All patients with residual disease of \u2265 2.5 cm after multiagent chemotherapy (CTX) were evaluated using additional positron emission tomography (PET), and those with a PET-positive result were irradiated with 30 Gy to the site of residual disease. We re-evaluated all sites of disease before and after CTX, as well as the PET-positive residual tumor that was treated in all relapsed patients. Documentation of radiation therapy (RT), treatment planning procedures, and portal images were carefully analyzed and compared with the centrally recommended RT prescription. The irradiated sites were compared with sites of relapse using follow-up computed tomography scans. A total of 2126 patients were enrolled, and 225 patients (11%) received RT. Radiation therapy documents of 152 irradiated patients (68%) were analyzed, with 28 irradiated patients (11%) relapsing subsequently. Eleven patients (39%) had an in-field relapse, 7 patients (25%) relapsed outside the irradiated volume, and an additional 10 patients (36%) showed mixed in- and out-field relapses. Of 123 patients, 20 (16%) with adequately performed RT relapsed, compared with 7 of 29 patients (24%) with inadequate RT. The frequency and pattern of relapses suggest that local RT to PET-positive residual disease is sufficient for patients in advanced-stage HL. Insufficient safety margins of local RT may contribute to in-field relapses. Journal: International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics. Year: 2015.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Melatonin effect on breast and ovarian cancers by targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.. Abstract: Melatonin, the hormone of the pineal gland, possesses a range of physiological functions, and recently, its anticancer effect has become more apparent. A more thorough understanding of molecular alterations in the components of several signaling pathways as new targets for cancer therapy is needed because of current innate restrictions such as drug toxicity, side effects, and acquired or de novo resistance. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is overactivated in many solid tumors, such as breast and ovarian cancers. This pathway in normal cells is essential for growth, proliferation, and survival. However, it is an undesirable characteristic in malignant cells. We have reviewed multiple studies about the effect of melatonin on breast and ovarian cancer, focusing on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Melatonin exerts its inhibitory effects via several mechanisms. A: Downregulation of downstream or upstream components of the signaling pathway such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate kinase (PI3K), p-PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and mTOR complex1 (mTORC1). B: Apoptosis induction by decreasing MDM2 expression, a downstream target of Akt, and mTOR, which leads to Bad activation in addition to Bcl-XL and p53 inhibition. C: Induction of autophagy in cancer cells via activating ULK1 after mTOR inhibition, resulting in Beclin-1 phosphorylation. Beclin-1 with AMBRA1 and VPS34 promotes PI3K complex I activity and autophagy in cancer cells. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway overlaps with other intracellular signaling pathways and components such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and other similar pathways. Cancer therapy can benefit from understanding how these pathways interact and how melatonin affects these pathways. Journal: IUBMB life. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Metabolic oncology is an exciting new field in cancer research, offering a new window to cancer's molecular plasticity and promise for the development of effective, cancer-selective therapies and novel biomarkers. It is based on the realization that cancer's unique metabolism (known since Warburg's report in 1923) with suppression of mitochondrial glucose oxidation and upregulation of cytoplasmic glycolysis is not a secondary but a primary event, offering many growth advantages to cancer cells. Many mechanisms have been revealed, including growth factors, oncogenes, and mutations, all contributing to a suppression of mitochondria, similar to what takes place in hypoxia. This suppression leads to inhibition of mitochondria-driven apoptosis, promotes proliferation, and enhances angiogenesis and metastatic potential. A number of molecular tools and small molecules targeting metabolic enzymes, including pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase, have been developed, inhibiting cancer growth in vitro and in vivo in several cancer types. Several have already entered early-phase trials, a great translational success considering the young age of the field (less than 10\u00a0years). Here we review the mechanisms and effects of these metabolic modulators and the rationale for further development. This rapidly accumulating knowledge allows some optimism that this may prove to be a paradigm shift in the way we understand and treat cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Stress-induced EGF receptor signaling through STAT3 and tumor progression in triple-negative breast cancer.. Abstract: Elevated STAT3 activity is a hallmark of many epithelial carcinomas particularly in breast cancers where it is known to contribute to tumor progression through a variety of context-dependent biological responses. However, its role downstream of stress-exposed EGF receptors (EGFR) that are transactivated in endosomes independent of exogenous ligand has not been studied. This review discusses how STAT3 signaling induced by therapeutic stress in EGFR-driven triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) might override normal epithelial homeostatic mechanisms and provide a survival advantage for tumor cells before they leave the primary tumor and spread to distant sites. Despite continued improvements in breast cancer treatment strategies, TNBC is still associated with poor prognosis and high risk of distant recurrence and death. Understanding EGFR-STAT3 signaling mechanisms regulating the earliest steps of tumor progression is a key to discovery of new targeted therapies against TNBC.

Abstract: Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and the search for specialised therapy options has been a challenge for decades. The emergence of active targeted therapies provides the opportunity to treat cancerous tissues without harming healthy ones due to peculiar physiological changes. Herein, peptides and peptide analogs have been gaining a lot of attention over the last decade, especially for the on-site delivery of therapeutics to target tissues in order to achieve efficient and reliable cancer treatment. Combining peptides with highly efficient drug delivery platforms could potentially eliminate off-target adverse effects encountered during active targeting of conventional chemotherapeutics. Small size, ease of production and characterisation, low immunogenicity and satisfactory binding affinity of peptides offer some advantages over other complex targeting moiety, no wonder the market of peptide-based drugs continues to expand expeditiously. It is estimated that the global peptide drug market will be worth around USD 48.04 billion by 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 9.4%. In this review, the current state of art of peptide-based therapeutics with special interest on tumour targeting peptides has been discussed. Moreover, various active targeting strategies such as the use functionalised peptides or peptide analogs are also elaborated. Journal: Journal of drug targeting. Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Crosstalk between autophagy and microbiota in cancer progression.. Abstract: Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process seen in eukaryotes and is essentially a lysosome-dependent protein degradation pathway. The dysregulation of autophagy is often associated with the pathogenesis of numerous types of cancers, and can not only promote the survival of cancer but also trigger the tumor cell death. During cancer development, the microbial community might predispose cells to tumorigenesis by promoting mucosal inflammation, causing systemic disorders, and may also regulate the immune response to cancer. The complex relationship between autophagy and microorganisms can protect the body by activating the immune system. In addition, autophagy and microorganisms can crosstalk with each other in multifaceted ways to influence various physiological and pathological responses involved in cancer progression. Various molecular mechanisms, correlating the microbiota disorders and autophagy activation, control the outcomes of protumor or antitumor responses, which depend on the cancer type, tumor microenvironment and disease stage. In this review, we mainly emphasize the leading role of autophagy during the interaction between pathogenic microorganisms and human cancers and investigate the various molecular mechanisms by which autophagy modulates such complicated biological processes. Moreover, we also highlight the possibility of curing cancers with multiple molecular agents targeting the microbiota/autophagy axis. Finally, we summarize the emerging clinical trials investigating the therapeutic potential of targeting either autophagy or microbiota as anticancer strategies, although the crosstalk between them has not been explored thoroughly.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Signaling pathways in cancer-associated fibroblasts and targeted therapy for cancer.. Abstract: To flourish, cancers greatly depend on their surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in TME are critical for cancer occurrence and progression because of their versatile roles in extracellular matrix remodeling, maintenance of stemness, blood vessel formation, modulation of tumor metabolism, immune response, and promotion of cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are highly heterogeneous stromal cells and their crosstalk with cancer cells is mediated by a complex and intricate signaling network consisting of transforming growth factor-beta, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Wnt, Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, epidermal growth factor receptor, Hippo, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, etc., signaling pathways. These signals in CAFs exhibit their own special characteristics during the cancer progression and have the potential to be targeted for anticancer therapy. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of these signaling cascades in interactions between cancer cells and CAFs is necessary to fully realize the pivotal roles of CAFs in cancers. Herein, in this review, we will summarize the enormous amounts of findings on the signals mediating crosstalk of CAFs with cancer cells and its related targets or trials. Further, we hypothesize three potential targeting strategies, including, namely, epithelial-mesenchymal common targets, sequential target perturbation, and crosstalk-directed signaling targets, paving the way for CAF-directed or host cell-directed antitumor therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The Current and Future Role of Radiation Therapy in the Era of CAR T-cell Salvage.. Abstract: Radiation therapy has the potential to modulate the immune system in a variety of ways, and given the critical role of the immune system in cancer elimination, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how radiation can be strategically implemented in conjunction with approved immunotherapies to improve the cancer patient's chance of cure and/or quality of life. Current successful, approved cancer immunotherapies fall into two broad classes: antibodies and cellular therapies. Approved cellular therapies thus far consist of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CD19 for refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Part of the ardor surrounding CAR T-cells stems from the fact that the survival curve of treated patients has a clear plateau, meaning that a number of patients with aggressive, disseminated disease who would have otherwise died rather rapidly appear to now be cured, commonly after just one dose. Despite an encouraging number of these durable remissions, the majority do still relapse. In this review, we discuss the potential for strategically utilizing radiation to further improve CAR T-cell patient outcomes. Given that there are currently over 750 cellular therapies in development, half of which are now in clinical trial, CAR T-cell usage will inevitably expand; as the field grows in importance and effectiveness, radiation oncology has the opportunity to coevolve symbiotically and steer these novel, exciting live therapies to new depths.

Abstract: Identifying robust survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will significantly improve patient care. Currently, endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict HCC survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill this gap, we present a deep learning (DL)-based model on HCC that robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in six cohorts. We built the DL-based, survival-sensitive model on 360 HCC patients' data using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), miRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq), and methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which predicts prognosis as good as an alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both considered. This DL-based model provides two optimal subgroups of patients with significant survival differences (<i>P</i> = 7.13e-6) and good model fitness [concordance index (C-index) = 0.68]. More aggressive subtype is associated with frequent <i>TP53</i> inactivation mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (<i>KRT19</i> and <i>EPCAM</i>) and tumor marker <i>BIRC5</i>, and activated Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (<i>n</i> = 230, C-index = 0.75), NCI cohort (<i>n</i> = 221, C-index = 0.67), Chinese cohort (<i>n</i> = 166, C-index = 0.69), E-TABM-36 cohort (<i>n</i> = 40, C-index = 0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (<i>n</i> = 27, C-index = 0.82). This is the first study to employ DL to identify multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of patients with HCC. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we expect this workflow to be useful at predicting HCC prognosis prediction. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(6); 1248-59. \u00a92017 AACR</i>.

Abstract: Cancer immunotherapy, which seeks to stimulate a patient's own immune system to combat cancer, is quickly becoming a central pillar of cancer therapeutics and has resulted in the development of many novel anticancer therapies. One subtype of cancer immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized cancer treatment and changed the standard of care for multiple indications. However, the advent of ICIs has produced a wide variety of inflammatory side effects termed immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), including ICI-induced Sicca syndrome. This article outlines the clinical features of ICI-induced Sicca syndrome and assesses its reported incidence in clinical trials, case series, and case reports across numerous cancers and treatment modalities. Presentations of ICI-induced Sicca syndrome in patients with pre-existing Sj\u04e7gren's disease and with extra-glandular manifestations will also be explored. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying IRAEs, including ICI-induced Sicca syndrome, will be evaluated through an examination of existing literature. Finally, the various treatment and management strategies as well as aims for future work will be discussed and reviewed. Journal: Oral diseases. Year: 2022.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Lineage-Specific Epigenomic and Genomic Activation of Oncogene HNF4A Promotes Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinomas.. Abstract: Gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (GIAC) of the tubular gastrointestinal (GI) tract including esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum comprise most GI cancers and share a spectrum of genomic features. However, the unified epigenomic changes specific to GIAC are poorly characterized. Using 907 GIAC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we applied mathematical algorithms to large-scale DNA methylome and transcriptome profiles to reconstruct transcription factor (TF) networks and identify a list of functionally hyperactive master regulator (MR) TF shared across different GIAC. The top candidate HNF4A exhibited prominent genomic and epigenomic activation in a GIAC-specific manner. A complex interplay between the HNF4A promoter and three distal enhancer elements was coordinated by GIAC-specific MRTF including ELF3, GATA4, GATA6, and KLF5. HNF4A also self-regulated its own promoter and enhancers. Functionally, HNF4A promoted cancer proliferation and survival by transcriptional activation of many downstream targets, including HNF1A and factors of interleukin signaling, in a lineage-specific manner. Overall, our study provides new insights into the GIAC-specific gene regulatory networks and identifies potential therapeutic strategies against these common cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that GIAC-specific master regulatory transcription factors control HNF4A via three distal enhancers to promote GIAC cell proliferation and survival.

Abstract: This article reviews the impact of single-cell sequencing (SCS) on cancer biology research. SCS has revolutionized our understanding of cancer and tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution, and the complex interplay between cancer cells and tumor microenvironment. SCS provides high-resolution profiling of individual cells in genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic landscapes, facilitating the detection of rare mutations, the characterization of cellular diversity, and the integration of molecular data with phenotypic traits. The integration of SCS with multi-omics has provided a multidimensional view of cellular states and regulatory mechanisms in cancer, uncovering novel regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Advances in computational tools, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning have been crucial in interpreting the vast amounts of data generated, leading to the identification of new biomarkers and the development of predictive models for patient stratification. Furthermore, there have been emerging technologies such as spatial transcriptomics and in situ sequencing, which promise to further enhance our understanding of tumor microenvironment organization and cellular interactions. As SCS and its related technologies continue to advance, they are expected to drive significant advances in personalized cancer diagnostics, prognosis, and therapy, ultimately improving patient outcomes in the era of precision oncology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cholangiocarcinoma Targeted Therapies: Mechanisms of Action and Resistance.. Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive bile duct malignancy with heterogeneous genomic features. Although most patients receive standard-of-care chemotherapy/immunotherapy, genomic changes that can be targeted with established or emerging therapeutics are common. Accordingly, precision medicine strategies are transforming the next-line treatment for patient subsets. Hotspot IDH1 mutations and activating fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 fusions occur frequently, and small-molecule inhibitors against these alterations are US Food and Drug Administration approved. Translational and basic science studies have elucidated the mechanisms of response and resistance in cholangiocarcinoma, providing insights into these targets that extend to other cancers. Additional US Food and Drug Administration-approved and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-recommended treatments for recurrent genomic changes include BRAF inhibition (BRAF-V600E) and trastumazab deruxtecan (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification). Furthermore, ongoing clinical trials show promising results with KRAS inhibition (KRAS-codon 12 mutations), PRTM5 inhibition, alone or with methylthioadenosine inhibition (5-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase deletion), and murine double minute 2 inhibition (murine double minute 2 amplification). Despite these advances, the rate, depth, and duration of response to each treatment need improvement. Moreover, many patients do not have currently targetable genotypes. This review examines the clinical efficacy and mechanisms of resistance associated with these treatments, as well as insights into the molecular and biological effects of pathway activation and inhibition, based on study of patient samples and preclinical models. It also explores strategies to overcome resistance and possible precision medicine approaches for additional patient subsets. Journal: The American journal of pathology. Year: 2025.

Dysregulation of and resistance to cell death are hallmarks of cancer. For over three decades, the development of therapies to promote treatment of cancer by inducing various cell death modalities, including apoptosis, has been a main goal of clinical oncology. Apoptosis pathways also interact with other signaling mechanisms, such as the p53 signaling pathway and the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. In addition to agents directly targeting the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway components, anticancer drugs that target the p53 and ISR signaling pathways are actively being developed. In this Review, we discuss selected and promising anticancer therapies in various stages of development, including drug targets, mechanisms, and resistance to related treatments, focusing especially on B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors, TRAIL analogues, DR5 antibodies, and strategies that target p53, mutant p53, and the ISR.

Abstract: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is an important signaling pathway in eukaryotic cells that is activated in a variety of cancers and is also associated with treatment resistance. This signaling pathway is an important target for anticancer therapy and holds great promise for research. At the same time PI3K inhibitors have a general problem that they have unavoidable toxic side effects. This review provides an explanation of the role of PI3K in the development and progression of cancer, including several important mutations, and a table listing the cancers caused by these mutations. We discuss the current landscape of PI3K inhibitors in preclinical and clinical trials, address the mechanisms of resistance to PI3K inhibition along with their associated toxic effects, and highlight significant advancements in preclinical research of this field. Furthermore, based on our study and comprehension of PI3K, we provide a recapitulation of the key lessons learned from the research process and propose potential measures for improvement that could prove valuable. The PI3K pathway is a biological pathway of great potential value. However, the reduction of its toxic side effects and combination therapies need to be further investigated.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Non-metastatic childhood ependymomas.. Abstract: Intracranial ependymomas of childhood are relatively infrequent. There are significant disagreements concerning optimal postoperative treatment as well as the patterns of relapse following treatment. The purpose of this retrospective study was the analysis of the recurrence pattern and therefore the implication on the extent of the radiotherapy fields. Data from 37 patients referred within 19 years were used for this study. From April 1975 to July 1993, 37 children aged 1-14 years were referred for postoperative treatment of an intracranial ependymoma. Twenty-eight children received postoperative radiation therapy and 26 patients received chemotherapy. The median follow-up is 6 years (range 2 months to 19 years). Overall survival and event free survival at 5 and 10 years were 40%. Eighteen children relapsed. Relapses occurred from 1.5 months to 3.6 years post treatment. Relapses were distant in four cases and local in 14. Age, sex, extent of primary resection, chemotherapy and type of radiation therapy did not influence the outcome. Children with poorly differentiated tumors who did not receive postoperative radiation therapy had a higher relapse rate but this difference is not statistically significant. Despite doses of radiation > or = 50 Gy the majority of recurrences were local. Our results, despite the small number of patients are in accordance to those previously published, suggest that prophylactic craniospinal irradiation is superfluous. Better means of achieved local control are required, such as three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy with dose-escalation study or hyperfractionation regimen.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Target Actionability Review: a systematic evaluation of replication stress as a therapeutic target for paediatric solid malignancies.. Abstract: Owing to the high numbers of paediatric cancer-related deaths, advances in therapeutic options for childhood cancer is a heavily studied field, especially over the past decade. Classical chemotherapy offers some therapeutic benefit but has proven long-term complications in survivors, and there is an urgent need to identify novel target-driven therapies. Replication stress is a major cause of genomic instability in cancer, triggering the stalling of the replication fork. Failure of molecular response by DNA damage checkpoints, DNA repair mechanisms and restarting the replication forks can exacerbate replication stress and initiate cell death pathways, thus presenting as a novel therapeutic target. To bridge the gap between preclinical evidence and clinical utility thereof, we apply the literature-driven systematic target actionability review methodology to published proof-of-concept (PoC) data related to the process of replication stress. A meticulous PubMed literature search was performed to gather replication stress-related articles (published between 2014 and 2021) across 16 different paediatric solid tumour types. Articles that fulfilled inclusion criteria were uploaded into the R2 informatics platform [r2.amc.nl] and assessed by critical appraisal. Key evidence based on nine pre-established PoC modules was summarised, and scores based on the quality and outcome of each study were assigned by two separate reviewers. Articles with discordant modules/scores were re-scored by a third independent reviewer, and a final consensus score was agreed upon by adjudication between all three reviewers. To visualise the final scores, an interactive heatmap summarising the evidence and scores associated with each PoC module across all, including paediatric tumour types, were generated. 145 publications related to targeting replication stress in paediatric tumours were systematically reviewed with an emphasis on DNA repair pathways and cell cycle checkpoint control. Although various targets in these pathways have been studied in these diseases to different extents, the results of this extensive literature search show\u00a0that ATR, CHK1, PARP or WEE1 are the most promising targets using either single agents or in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, high-grade glioma or medulloblastoma. Targeting these pathways in other paediatric malignancies may work as well, but here, the evidence was more limited. The evidence for other targets (such as ATM and DNA-PK) was also limited but showed promising results in some malignancies and requires more studies in other tumour types. Overall, we have created an extensive overview of targeting replication stress across 16 paediatric tumour types, which can be explored using the interactive heatmap on the R2 target actionability review platform [https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi?option=imi2_targetmap_v1].

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Advances in the classification of pediatric brain tumors through DNA methylation profiling: From research tool to frontline diagnostic.. Abstract: Despite significant improvements in pediatric brain tumor therapy and outcome, too many children still die of disease, and too many survivors experience significant sequelae as a result of conventional therapies. The molecular characterization of pediatric brain tumors has afforded tremendous insight into the basic biology and clinical management of these deadly childhood diseases. Genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptional profiling have facilitated the identification of significant heterogeneity among previously uniform disease entities. In particular, DNA methylation profiling has emerged as a robust tool for identifying key disease-specific subgroups that can exhibit distinct clinical outcomes. These approaches, which also complement classic histologic techniques, can suggest key mechanistic underpinnings of tumorigenesis and open the door for better informed and more tailored therapy. By leveraging the results of large-scale classifications of disease cohorts, novel driver mutations and pathways can be uncovered, enabling the generation of faithful animal models, promoting targeted drug design, informing developmental biology, and ultimately translating into improved clinical management. In this review, progress in the epigenetic classification of common malignant pediatric brain tumors, namely medulloblastoma, ependymoma, high-grade glioma, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, and central nervous system embryonal tumors, will be discussed, and the potential role of DNA methylation profiling as a frontline diagnostic modality will be emphasized.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) patients are often refractory to targeted therapies including proteasome inhibitors. Here, analysis of RNA sequencing data derived from 672 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory disease identified the acid ceramidase, ASAH1, as a key regulator of resistance to proteasome inhibitors. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of ASAH1 remarkably restored sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors and protected mice from resistant MM progression in vivo. Mechanistically, ASAH1 depletion of ceramide promoted SET inhibition of PP2A phosphatase activity, thus facilitating increased expression and activity of the pro-survival proteins, MCL-1 and BCL-2. We corroborated these findings in human MM datasets, and in ex vivo patients' MM cells. These preclinical studies suggest that ASAH1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM. Journal: Haematologica. Year: 2025.

Abstract: The combination of next-generation sequencing and advanced computational data analysis approaches has revolutionized our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of cancer development and progression. The coincident development of targeted small molecule and antibody-based therapies that target a cancer's genomic dependencies has fuelled the transition of genomic assays into clinical use in patients with cancer. Beyond the identification of individual targetable alterations, genomic methods can gauge mutational load, which might predict a therapeutic response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors or identify cancer-specific proteins that inform the design of personalized anticancer vaccines. Emerging clinical applications of cancer genomics include monitoring treatment responses and characterizing mechanisms of resistance. The increasing relevance of genomics to clinical cancer care also highlights several considerable challenges, including the need to promote equal access to genomic testing. Journal: Nature reviews.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting the Hedgehog pathway with novel Gli1 hydrophobic tagging degraders.. Abstract: The Hedgehog/Glioma-associated oncogene (Hh/Gli) signaling pathway plays an essential role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Aberrant regulation of this pathway has been linked to various human malignancies. Gli1, the downstream transcription factor of the Hh pathway, is the ultimate effector of the canonical Hh pathway and has been identified as a common regulator of several tumorigenic pathways prevalent in Hh-independent cancers. Thus Gli1 represents a unique and promising drug target for a wide range of cancers. However, the identification and development of small molecules that directly target Gli1 protein have progressed slowly, due to an insufficient efficacy and selectivity. Herein, we developed novel small-molecule Gli1 degraders based on the hydrophobic tagging (HyT) strategy. The Gli1 HyT degrader 8e potently inhibited the proliferation of Gli1-overexpressed HT29 colorectal cancer cells, induced Gli1 degradation with a DC<sub>50</sub> value of 5.4\u00a0\u03bcM in HT29 and achieved 70% degradation at 7.5\u00a0\u03bcM in MEF<sup>PTCH1-/-</sup> and MEF<sup>SUFU-/-</sup>cell lines, via proteasome pathway. Compared to the canonical Hh antagonist Vismodegib, 8e exhibited much stronger potency in suppressing the mRNA expression of Hh target genes in Hh-overactivated MEF<sup>PTCH1-/-</sup> and Vismodegib resistant MEF<sup>SUFU-/-</sup> cells. Our study provides small molecule Gli1 degraders effectively interfering with both canonical and noncanonical Hh signaling and overcoming current Smoothened (SMO) antagonists resistance, which might pave a new avenue for developing therapeutic modalities targeting Hh/Gli1 signaling pathway.

The therapy strategy is important in skin cancer treatment, depending on several criteria such as stage, size, and localization. Removal of cancerous tissue following anticancer therapeutic administration is considered as gold standard in skin cancer treatment. However, annually rising drug resistance, local inflammation, and ineffective treatment result in a reduction in the effectiveness of the patient's treatment. Nanotechnology has emerged as a prospective in the field of skin cancer medicine, offering innovative, promising solutions for therapeutic procedures and targeted drug delivery. Different nanomaterials are investigated for their potential in skin cancer treatment. Nanohydrogels as a hybrid material, have gained considerable attention due to their unique biomedical and pharmaceutical properties, such as biocompatibility, high water content, and tunable physicochemical characteristics. The principal problem with common skin melanoma chemotherapy is the strong side effects because therapeutics used for treatment do not distinguish cancer cells from healthy cells. Nanohydrogels, as a new-generation, versatile system with the possession of dual characteristics of hydrogels and nanoparticles have shown great potential in targeted delivery in cancer therapy thanks to the possibility of their various modifications, and by that overcome problems with side effects of treatment. This scientific review provides an analysis of the current state of research on nanohydrogels in skin cancer medicine, highlighting their design principles, synthesis methods, and applications in drug delivery, imaging, and combination therapies.

Abstract: The Hippo pathway is a highly conserved signalling network that controls tissue growth and cell fate, responding to physical properties of the tissue microenvironment and cell biological features such as adhesion and polarity. Hippo signalling perturbation is associated with several human diseases, particularly various solid cancers. Hippo pathway-targeted therapies are beginning to emerge for the treatment of cancer, most of which are focused on disrupting the ability of the YAP and TAZ transcription co-activator proteins to promote transcription of genes with their cognate TEAD1-4 DNA binding proteins. Recently, TEAD inhibitors have shown promise in a phase I clinical trial in cancers that are enriched for Hippo pathway mutations, such as mesothelioma. Moreover, Hippo\u00a0pathway-targeted therapies have great potential to be combined with RAS-MAPK pathway inhibitors, given the close functional relationship that these signalling pathways share in development and disease.

Abstract: To identify factors that may predict and affect the risk of relapse in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. This was a retrospective study of an Italian cohort of patients with paediatric (\u226418y) onset anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Of the 62 children included (39 females; median age at onset 9y 10mo, range 1y 2mo-18y; onset between 2005 and 2018), 21 per cent relapsed (median two total events per relapsing patient, range 2-4). Time to first relapse was median 31.5\u00a0months (range 7-89mo). Severity at first relapse was lower than onset (median modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 3, range 2-4, vs median mRS 5, range 3-5; admission to intensive care unit: 0/10 vs 3/10). At the survival analysis, the risk of relapsing was significantly lower in patients who received three or more different immune therapies at first disease event (hazard ratio 0.208, 95% confidence interval 0.046-0.941; p=0.042). Neurological outcome at follow-up did not differ significantly between patients with relapsing and monophasic disease (mRS 0-1 in 39/49 vs 12/13; p=0.431), although follow-up duration was significantly longer in relapsing (median 84mo, range 14-137mo) than in monophasic patients (median 32mo, range 4-108mo; p=0.002). Relapses may occur in about one-fifth of children with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, are generally milder than at onset, and may span over a long period, although they do not seem to be associated with severity in the acute phase or with outcome at follow-up. Aggressive immune therapy at onset may reduce risk of relapse. Relapses of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis may span over a long period. Relapses were not associated with severity in the acute phase or outcome at follow-up. Aggressive immune therapy at onset appears to decrease risk of relapse.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Role of Surveillance Imaging in Patients With Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma.. Abstract: The role of surveillance imaging (SI) in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in first complete remission (CR1) is unclear. Patients with PTCL were identified through prospectively maintained T-cell lymphoma databases from the National Cancer Centre Singapore/Singapore General Hospital and Weill-Cornell Medical College after institutional review board approval. Patients with leukemia or indolent, composite, and cutaneous lymphomas were excluded. The patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed to determine the frequency and type of SI used. Of those with relapse, the method of relapse detection and data on symptoms, signs, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase LDH were extracted. A total of 338 patients were included in the present study. In the first year after achieving CR1, patients had an average of 1.2 and a median of 1 SI performed (range, 0-4). In the second year after achieving CR1, they had an average of 0.78 and a median of 1 SI performed (range, 0-4). Of the 135 patients who achieved CR1, 61 (45%) developed a relapse. Relapses were detected before SI in 48 (84%), and 9 patients had relapses detected during routine SI. Of the 9 patients whose relapses were detected during planned SI, only 3 did not have any symptoms or signs suggestive of relapsed disease. Of these 3 patients, 2 had angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and 1 had natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Most PTCL relapses were detected before planned SI, and most patients had symptoms with relapse. Only 3 patients (5.2%) were completely asymptomatic at relapse, suggesting a limited utility of routine imaging for detecting PTCL relapses. Journal: Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia.

Abstract: Molecular entities showing dysregulation in multiple cancers may hold great biomarker or therapeutic potential. There is accumulating evidence that highlights the dysregulation of a long non-coding RNA, MIR210HG, in various cancers and its oncogenic role. However, a comprehensive analysis of MIR210HG expression pattern, molecular mechanisms, diagnostic or prognostic significance or evaluation of its interaction with tumor microenvironment across various cancers remains unstudied. A systematic pan-cancer analysis was done using multiple public databases and bioinformatic tools to study the molecular role and clinical significance of MIR210HG. We have analyzed expression patterns, genome alteration, transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, correlation with patient survival, immune infiltrates, co-expressed genes, interacting proteins, and pathways associated with MIR210HG. The Pan cancer expression analysis of MIR210HG through various tumor datasets demonstrated that MIR210HG is significantly upregulated in most cancers and increased with the tumor stage in a subset of them. Furthermore, prognostic analysis revealed high MIR210HG expression is associated with poor overall and disease-free survival in specific cancer types. Genetic alteration analysis showed minimal alterations in the MIR210HG locus, indicating that overexpression in cancers is not due to gene amplification. The exploration of SNPs on MIR210HG suggested possible structural changes that may affect its interactions with the miRNAs. The correlation of MIR210HG with promoter methylation was found to be significantly negative in nature in majority of cancers depicting the possible epigenetic regulation of expression of MIR210HG. Additionally, MIR210HG showed negative correlations with immune cells and thus may have strong impact on the tumor microenvironment. Functional analysis indicates its association with hypoxia, angiogenesis, metastasis, and DNA damage repair processes. MIR210HG was found to interact with several proteins and potentially regulate chromatin modifications and transcriptional regulation. A first pan-can cancer analysis of MIR210HG highlights its transcriptional and epigenetic deregulation and oncogenic role in the majority of cancers, its correlation with tumor microenvironment factors such as hypoxia and immune infiltration, and its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in several cancers.

This review summarizes current data on clinical development and application of IMiDs in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes, focusing primarily on lenalidomide, with additional discussion on managing common side effects. Improved upon the prototype thalidomide, the second-generation compound lenalidomide has enhanced immunological and anti-cancer properties with fewer side effects, while next-generation small molecule cereblon/E3 ubiquitin ligase modulator CC-122 is in early clinical studies. Lenalidomide is FDA-approved for treatment of relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma as a single agent, as well as in combination with rituximab for R/R follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. In addition, numerous clinical trials of lenalidomide, as single agent, in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies, or in combination with chemoimmunotherapy regimens, have shown promise in aggressive and indolent NHL in both the upfront and relapsed/refractory setting. As clinical trials with lenalidomide continue to find success in both indolent and aggressive lymphomas, IMiDs are poised to be important building blocks for combinatorial strategies with antibodies, chemotherapy, novel target agents, and emerging immunotherapy involving immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy. Delineation of treatment-specific and disease-specific biomarkers is an important research objective to gain insight into potential mechanisms of action, and to guide future clinical development.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Antibody-based therapies have emerged as a transformative approach, offering specificity and the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional treatments. This comprehensive review evaluates the current and emerging applications of antibody therapies in HCC, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), bispecific antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). It explores their mechanisms of action, such as immune modulation, angiogenesis inhibition, and targeted cytotoxicity. Key advancements include the integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors into clinical practice and the development of bispecific antibodies and ADCs targeting tumor-specific antigens like glypican-3. While these therapies have shown promise in improving patient outcomes, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, resistance mechanisms, and immune-related adverse events persist.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Current Understanding of HSP90 as a Novel Therapeutic Target: An Emerging Approach for the Treatment of Cancer.. Abstract: Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone that is considered to be the most abundantly expressed protein in various human cancers such as breast, lung, colon, prostate, leukemia and skin. The master regulator, HSP90 plays a pivotal role in the conformational stabilization, maturation and activity of its various labile oncogenic client proteins such as p53, ErbB2, Bcr-Abl, Akt, Her-2, Cdk4, Cdk6, Raf-1 and v-Src in altered cells. Hence, making a guaranteed attempt to inhibit such a master regulator for cancer therapy appears to be a potential approach for combinatorial inhibition of numerous oncogenic signaling pathways simultaneously. Considerable efforts are being under way to develop novel molecular targets and its inhibitors that may block key signaling pathways involved in the process of tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this regards, HSP90 has acquired immense interest as a potent anticancer drug-target due to its key functional link with multiple signaling pathways involved in the process of cell proliferation and cell survival. Notably, geldanamycin and its derivatives (17-AAG, 17-DMAG) have shown quite encouraging results in inhibiting HSP90 function in several cancers and currently almost 17 drug candidates known to be target HSP90 are being under clinical trials either as single agents or combinatorial therapy. Hence, this review is an attempt to get new insight into novel drug target therapy by focusing on recent advances made in understanding HSP90 chaperone structure-function relationships, identification of new HSP90 client proteins and, more importantly, on the advancements of HSP90 targeted therapy based on various existing and emerging classical inhibitors.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Genomics of hepatitis B and C infections: diagnostic and therapeutic applications of microarray profiling.. Abstract: Microarray profiling offers many potential advances in diagnostic and therapeutic intervention in human disease because of its unparalleled ability to conduct high-throughput analysis of gene expression. However, limitations of this technique relate in part to issues regarding the various methodologies and experimental designs as well as difficulties in the interpretation of results. Despite this, microarray profiling has led to a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Key events in clearance and the development of chronicity of HCV have been identified that may prove to have a role in the development of future treatments. In addition, pharmacogenomic studies of interferon-based treatment for chronic HCV and HBV have provided mechanistic insights into the therapeutic action of interferons. These advances have implications with respect to the development of improved therapeutic agents. New biomarkers for cancer screening and gene profiles with prognostic value for survival have also been developed for hepatocellular carcinoma, which frequently complicates chronic viral hepatitis. Thus, microarray profiling offers enormous potential for improvements in antiviral therapy and our understanding of blood-borne viral hepatitis. Journal: Antiviral therapy. Year: 2006.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma is a leading and increasing contributor to cancer-related death worldwide. Recent advancements in both liver-directed therapies in the form of yttrium-90 (<sup>90</sup>Y) radioembolization (RE) and systemic therapy in the form of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have expanded treatment options for patients with an otherwise poor prognosis. Despite these gains, ICIs and <sup>90</sup>Y-RE each have key limitations with low objective response rates and persistent hazard of out-of-field recurrence, respectively, and overall survival remains low. However, each therapy's strength may mitigate the other's weakness, making them potentially ideal partners for combination treatment strategies. This review discusses the scientific and clinical rationale for combining <sup>90</sup>Y-RE with ICIs, highlights early clinical trial data on its safety and effectiveness, and proposes key issues to be addressed in this emerging field. With optimal strategies, combination therapies can potentially result in increasing likelihood of durable and curative outcomes in later stage patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The complex journey of targeting RAS in oncology.. Abstract: Given the prevalence of RAS mutations in various cancers, personalized therapeutic approaches, guided by molecular markers, are essential. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have emerged as potential therapeutic options; however, they also face obstacles such as toxicity and limited efficacy. Alternative strategies, such as direct inhibitors combined with pathway modulators, RNA interference, and gene-editing technologies, are under clinical investigation. The targeting of RAS, complicated by its structural nuances, particularly in the G domain, has advanced with the identification of druggable pockets such as the SW-II pocket. This breakthrough has led to the development of targeted therapeutics, such as sotorasib and adagrasib, for KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, these advancements face challenges, including adaptive resistance and the necessity for isoform selectivity. New inhibitors, such as LY3537982 or GDC-6036, are promising, but achieving effective and selective RAS inhibition remains a significant challenge. Additionally, clinical trials have highlighted variability in patient responses, attributing limited treatment efficacy to resistance mechanisms, including on-target mutations and off-target pathway activations. Finally, the RAS oncogene, traditionally viewed as predominantly pro-cancerous, plays a complex role in oncogenesis, with recent evidence suggesting context-dependent effects, such as inducing senescence in certain cells. This shift in understanding underscores the therapeutic potential of manipulating the interplay between RAS and TP53 mutations in cancer. In conclusion, the complexity of effectively targeting the RAS-RAF-ERK pathway is exacerbated by the diverse resistance mechanisms. Challenges such as off-target effects and delivery issues remain significant barriers in the introduction of effective therapies based on RAS inhibitors. This overview highlights the evolving nature of targeting RAS in cancer therapy. Journal: BMC cancer. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting mitochondrial dysfunctions in pancreatic cancer evokes new therapeutic opportunities.. Abstract: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly devastating neoplasm due to its irrepressible characteristics and propensity to override the available treatment strategies. Rapid prevalence and enormous severity of this cancer urgently demand the exploration of novel approaches for the development of effective therapeutic measures. Metabolic derangement is one of the hallmarks of cancers which restructures mitochondrial activities and biological pathways. Apart from their bioenergetic and biosynthetic functions, mitochondria are also implicated in a myriad of cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, senescence, homeostasis, and other cell regulatory mechanisms. It has been noted that PC, like other types of cancers, exploits these activities in favor of tumor growth and survival by inducing mitochondrial dysfunctions such as mitochondrial-DNA mutation, metabolic enzyme modification, ROS generation, mitophagy, evasion of apoptosis, and mitochondrial biogenesis. During pancreatic carcinogenesis, a large number of onco-factors including Bcl-2 family proteins, NF-\u03baB, HIFs, NRF2, NOX, MFNs, DRP1, DUSP6, Cyp-D, PARKIN, and others are dysregulated, resulting into reprogramming of metabolic pathways and cellular kinetics. Hence, targeted interventions in these metabolic derangements may present some effective anticancer approaches. The current review gives an insight into various mitochondrial disorders and their targetable molecules in PC which may provide certain novel opportunities in the pursuit of therapeutic development. Furthermore, we have also discussed certain treatment perspectives in PC based on specific mitochondrial activities. Journal: Critical reviews in oncology/hematology. Year: 2022.

Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) shows variable responses to immunotherapy, highlighting the need for biomarkers to guide patient selection. We applied a spatial multi-omics approach to 234 advanced NSCLC patients treated with programmed death 1-based immunotherapy across three cohorts to identify biomarkers associated with outcome. Spatial proteomics (n\u2009=\u200967) and spatial compartment-based transcriptomics (n\u2009=\u2009131) enabled profiling of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Using spatial proteomics, we identified a resistance cell-type signature including proliferating tumor cells, granulocytes, vessels (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20093.8, P\u2009=\u20090.004) and a response signature, including M1/M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells (HR\u2009=\u20090.4, P\u2009=\u20090.019). We then generated a cell-to-gene resistance signature using spatial transcriptomics, which was predictive of poor outcomes (HR\u2009=\u20095.3, 2.2, 1.7 across Yale, University of Queensland and University of Athens cohorts), while a cell-to-gene response signature predicted favorable outcomes (HR\u2009=\u20090.22, 0.38 and 0.56, respectively). This framework enables robust TIME modeling and identifies biomarkers to support precision immunotherapy in NSCLC. Journal: Nature genetics. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: FuSViz-visualization and interpretation of structural variation using cancer genomics and transcriptomics data.. Abstract: Structural variation (SV) is a frequent category of genetic alterations important for understanding cancer genome evolution and revealing key cancer driver events. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the ability to detect SVs of various sizes and types has improved, at both the DNA and RNA levels. However, SV calls are still prone to a considerable fraction of false positives, which necessitates visual inspection and manual curation as part of the quality control process. Identification of reliable and recurrent SVs in larger cohorts lends strength to revealing the driving roles of SVs in cancer development and to the discovery of potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Here, we present FuSViz, an application for visualization, interpretation, and prioritization of SVs. The tool provides multiple data view approaches in a user-friendly interface, allowing the investigation of prevalence and recurrence of SVs and relevant partner genes in a sample cohort. It integrates SV calls from DNA\u00a0and RNA sequencing datasets to comprehensively illustrate the biological impact of SVs on the implicated genes and associated genomic regions. The functionality of FuSViz is intended for interrogation of both recurrent and private SVs, effectively assisting with pathogenicity evaluation and biomarker discovery in cancer sequencing projects.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Emerging therapeutic strategies and opportunities in targeting protein pathways for breast cancer treatment: a critical review.. Abstract: Understanding breast cancer at a molecular level is essential for developing effective treatments due to its significant impact on women's mortality rates globally. Targeted medicines focus on specific proteins crucial to breast cancer progression, offering a promising treatment avenue. These proteins, often overexpressed or mutated in cancer cells, are vital for cell proliferation, division, and survival. Targeted drugs aim to inhibit these proteins, halting disease progression and sparing non-cancerous cells, which reduces side effects and improves patient quality of life. Key proteins in breast cancer treatment include HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), ER (estrogen receptor), and PR (progesterone receptor). Drugs like Trastuzumab target HER2 to impede tumor growth in HER2-positive cancers, while hormone therapies targeting ER and PR improve outcomes for hormone receptor-positive cancers. Examining proteins such as EGFR, HER2/Neu, and ER reveals their roles in cancer pathways, with pathways like PI3K/Akt/mTOR (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) being crucial targets for therapies, potentially revolutionizing breast cancer treatment.

Abstract: The notions of inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) have been recognised for many years but recent advances in sequencing technology are allowing the true extent of both forms of heterogeneity to be revealed in detail for the first time. In this review we examine the current evidence for ITH, the possibility of cancers following a branched rather than linear evolutionary path and the potential implications both of these may have for the mechanisms of drug resistance acquisition. We also note that although clearly present in many cases, heterogeneity and branched evolution are not universal, with cases of tumour homogeneity and linear evolution still detected relatively frequently. The complexity induced by cases of ITH presents a considerable challenge for bioinformatics analyses and we illustrate this by describing the specific case of point mutation detection and a number of approaches which have been taken to combat these issues. Equally, the sequencing procedures which generate these data are rendered much more difficult in the face of ITH and we present a discussion of these problems in addition to describing some of the alternate paradigms being considered to overcome them.

Abstract: Somatic analysis of the molecular features of human tumors through numerous efforts including The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium has led to unprecedented insight into the biological basis of cancer behavior. Numerous genomewide sequencing techniques have been utilized in these studies to understand DNA mutations, epigenomic alterations, and ultimately differences in protein expression profiles across various cancers. Due to the dropping costs of next-generation sequencing as well as growing power and ease of use of computational resources, researchers are able to apply these techniques to more specific cancer contexts and/or rarer tumor types. In this chapter, we describe the rationale for and details of methods used in our group for exome analysis of germ cell tumors. The methods described should also be readily applicable to genomic analysis of other tumors. Journal: Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.). Year: 2021. Authors: Tewari A, Van Allen E.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OV) remains the most lethal gynecological malignancy. The aim of this study was to identify molecular subtypes of OV through integrative multi-omics analysis and construct machine learning-based prognostic models for predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy. In here, the mutation, copy number variation, RNA sequencing expression profiles, and clinical information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Multi-omics data were stratified using the MOVICS package, identifying different molecular subtypes. Our analysis identified 2 molecular subtypes (CS1 and CS2) with significant survival differences. Transcriptional regulatory network analysis revealed differential activation of transcription factors such as FOXA1 and GATA3 in CS1, whereas AR and ESR2 were enriched in CS2. A robust prognostic signature comprising 5 key genes was developed through the integration of 10 machine learning algorithms, demonstrating high predictive power across data sets. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that anti-tumor immune cells were more abundant in low-risk groups, whereas pro-tumor immune cells predominated in high-risk groups. Furthermore, low-risk patients exhibited better immunotherapy responses and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). In conclusion, our findings underscore the potential of multi-omics integration in unveiling novel OV subtypes and constructing predictive models that inform personalized treatment strategies. Future research should focus on validating these findings in larger cohorts to enhance OV management through targeted therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Less than a year since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, ten vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved for at least limited use, with over sixty others in clinical trials. This swift achievement has generated excitement and arrives at a time of great need, as the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide continues to rapidly increase. Two vaccines are currently approved for full use, both built on mRNA and lipid nanotechnology platforms, a success story of mRNA technology 20\u00a0years in the making. For patients with cancer, questions arise around the safety and efficacy of these vaccines in the setting of immune alterations engendered by their malignancy and/or therapies. We summarize the current data on leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates and vaccination of patients undergoing immunomodulatory cancer treatments. Most current cancer therapeutics should not prevent the generation of protective immunity. We call for more research in this area and recommend that the majority of patients with cancer receive COVID vaccinations when possible. Journal: Journal of hematology & oncology. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Hairy cell leukemia is a rare form of leukemia: three hundred new cases are diagnosed each year in France. The diagnosis is based on: (1) morphological examination of the blood and bone marrow smear, (2) analysis by flow cytometry of hairy cells, which express three or the four following markers: CD11c, CD25, CD103 and CD123, (3) identification of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation, a true molecular marker of the disease. The management of treatment has evolved considerably in recent years. As of today, the purine analogues remain the standard treatment in the first line. Relapses are however observed in about 40% of cases. In the event of a first relapse, the preferred option is treatment with immunochemotherapy i.e. a combination of cladribine plus rituximab. Subsequent relapses are treated with moxetumomab pasudotox or BRAF inhibitors which provide indisputable benefits if third-line treatment is required. We will discuss in patients with relapsed/refractory hairy cell leukemia the needs for personalized medicine and the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment modality. The good prognosis for LT requires treatments that are not immunosuppressive, non-myelotoxic, and do not increase the risk of secondary cancers. Journal: Bulletin du cancer. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Despite the abundance of large-scale molecular and drug-response data, the insights gained about the mechanisms underlying treatment efficacy in cancer has been in general limited. Machine learning algorithms applied to those datasets most often are used to provide predictions without interpretation, or reveal single drug-gene association and fail to derive robust insights. We propose to use Macau, a bayesian multitask multi-relational algorithm to generalize from individual drugs and genes and explore the interactions between the drug targets and signaling pathways' activation. A typical insight would be: \"Activation of pathway Y will confer sensitivity to any drug targeting protein X\". We applied our methodology to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) screening, using gene expression of 990 cancer cell lines, activity scores of 11 signaling pathways derived from the tool PROGENy as cell line input and 228 nominal targets for 265 drugs as drug input. These interactions can guide a tissue-specific combination treatment strategy, for example suggesting to modulate a certain pathway to maximize the drug response for a given tissue. We confirmed in literature drug combination strategies derived from our result for brain, skin and stomach tissues. Such an analysis of interactions across tissues might help target discovery, drug repurposing and patient stratification strategies. Journal: Scientific reports. Year: 2018.

Abstract: Wnt signaling plays an essential role in the initiation and progression of various types of cancer. Besides, the Wnt pathway components have been established as reliable biomarkers and potential targets for cancer therapy. Wnt signaling is categorized into canonical and noncanonical pathways. The canonical pathway is involved in cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and migration, while the noncanonical pathway regulates cell polarity and migration. Apart from its biological role in development and homeostasis, the Wnt pathway has been implicated in several pathological disorders, including cancer. As a result, inhibiting this pathway has been a focus of cancer research with multiple targetable candidates in development. In this review, our focus will be to summarize information about ongoing and completed clinical trials targeting various Wnt pathway components, along with describing current and emerging Wnt targeted therapies. In addition, we will discuss potential opportunities and associated challenges of inhibiting Wnt signaling for cancer therapy. Journal: International journal of cancer. Year: 2022.

Abstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in cancer progression and treatment response. It comprises a complex network of stromal cells, immune cells, extracellular matrix, and blood vessels, all of which interact with cancer cells and influence tumor behaviour. This review article provides an in-depth examination of the TME, focusing on stromal cells, blood vessels, signaling molecules, and ECM, along with commonly available therapeutic compounds that target these components. Moreover, we explore the TME as a novel strategy for discovering new anti-tumor drugs. The dynamic and adaptive nature of the TME offers opportunities for targeting specific cellular interactions and signaling pathways. We discuss emerging approaches, such as combination therapies that simultaneously target cancer cells and modulate the TME. Finally, we address the challenges and future prospects in targeting the TME. Overcoming drug resistance, improving drug delivery, and identifying new therapeutic targets within the TME are among the challenges discussed. We also highlight the potential of personalized medicine and the integration of emerging technologies, such as immunotherapy and nanotechnology, in TME-targeted therapies. This comprehensive review provides insights into the TME and its therapeutic implications. Understanding the TME's complexity and targeting its components offer promising avenues for the development of novel anti-tumor therapies and improved patient outcomes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting the Wnt Pathway in Cancer: A Review of Novel Therapeutics.. Abstract: Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that controls cell-to-cell interactions during embryogenesis. In adults, Wnt signaling plays a role in tissue homeostasis in almost every organ system. Aberrations within this pathway are implicated in a spectrum of human diseases. A variety of perturbations have been described in both solid and hematologic malignancies, lending way to Wnt signaling as a target for anti-cancer therapy. Of particular interest is the role of Wnt signaling in the development and maintenance of cancer stem cells, a rare population of cells that are able to maintain a tumor via self-renewal and thought to be more resistant to chemotherapy than bulk tumor cells. The ability to eradicate cancer stem cells may decrease the risk of cancer relapse and metastasis. A number of therapeutic agents specifically targeting the Wnt pathway have entered clinical trials, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. We will provide an overview of agents that have been developed to target the Wnt pathways and a summary of pre-clinical and clinical trials. Journal: Targeted oncology. Year: 2017.

Abstract: Capicua (CIC)'s transcriptional repressor function is implicated in neurodevelopment and in oligodendroglioma (ODG) aetiology. However, CIC's role in these contexts remains obscure, primarily from our currently limited knowledge regarding its biological functions. Moreover, CIC mutations in ODG invariably co-occur with a neomorphic IDH1/2 mutation, yet the functional relationship between these two genetic events is unknown. Here, we analysed models derived from an E6/E7/hTERT-immortalized (i.e. p53- and RB-deficient) normal human astrocyte cell line. To examine the consequences of CIC loss, we compared transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles between CIC wild-type and knockout cell lines, with and without mutant IDH1 expression. Our analyses revealed dysregulation of neurodevelopmental genes in association with CIC loss. CIC ChIP-seq was also performed to expand upon the currently limited ensemble of known CIC target genes. Among the newly identified direct CIC target genes were EPHA2 and ID1, whose functions are linked to neurodevelopment and the tumourigenicity of in vivo glioma tumour models. NFIA, a known mediator of gliogenesis, was discovered to be uniquely overexpressed in CIC-knockout\u2009cells expressing mutant IDH1-R132H protein. These results identify neurodevelopment and specific genes within this context as candidate targets through which CIC alterations may contribute to the progression of IDH-mutant gliomas. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The genomic landscape of pediatric cancers: Implications for diagnosis and treatment.. Abstract: The past decade has witnessed a major increase in our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of childhood cancer. Genomic sequencing studies have highlighted key differences between pediatric and adult cancers. Whereas many adult cancers are characterized by a high number of somatic mutations, pediatric cancers typically have few somatic mutations but a higher prevalence of germline alterations in cancer predisposition genes. Also noteworthy is the remarkable heterogeneity in the types of genetic alterations that likely drive the growth of pediatric cancers, including copy number alterations, gene fusions, enhancer hijacking events, and chromoplexy. Because most studies have genetically profiled pediatric cancers only at diagnosis, the mechanisms underlying tumor progression, therapy resistance, and metastasis remain poorly understood. We discuss evidence that points to a need for more integrative approaches aimed at identifying driver events in pediatric cancers at both diagnosis and relapse. We also provide an overview of key aspects of germline predisposition for cancer in this age group. Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.). Year: 2019. Authors: Sweet-Cordero EA, Biegel JA.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Profiling of extracellular vesicles in oral cancer, from transcriptomics to proteomics.. Abstract: Oral cancers occurring in different subsites can have distinct etiologies' and are a significant problem worldwide. In general, the incidence of oral cancers has declined over the last decade due to improvements in modifiable risk factors (tobacco and alcohol consumption). However, recent data suggest that the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas in the oral tongue and oropharynx are increasing. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is an important risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer and is associated with better treatment responses when compared with HPV-unrelated oropharyngeal cancer. Regardless of the subsite, there are no clinically available biomarkers for the early detection of these cancers and many are detected at an advanced stage and are associated with poor 5-year survival rates. Tumor tissue and serial needle biopsies are used to diagnose and prognosticate oral cancers but have important limitations. Besides being invasive and physically painful, these types of biopsies offer a limited view of a complex tumor due to inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and a dynamic tumor microenvironment. Liquid biopsies offer a promising and alternative way to measure disease in real-time. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small particles that are secreted by all cells types and can be readily isolated from a wide range of biofluids. EVs are structurally stable and can horizontally transfer bioactive molecules to distant sites throughout the body in concentrated forms that exceed what can be delivered in a soluble format. As EVs represent their cell of origin, biofluid derived EVs are heterogeneous and are comprised of a complex repertoire of host- and cancer-derived particles. This review article has focused on studies that have used transcriptomics and proteomics to explore the function and clinical significance of EVs in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrative multi-omics analysis reveals a novel subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma with biological and clinical relevance.. Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous tumor, and the development of accurate predictive models for prognosis and drug sensitivity remains challenging. We integrated laboratory data and public cohorts to conduct a multi-omics analysis of HCC, which included bulk RNA sequencing, proteomic analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics sequencing (ST-seq), and genome sequencing. We constructed a tumor purity (TP) and tumor microenvironment (TME) prognostic risk model. Proteomic analysis validated the TP-TME-related signatures. Joint analysis of scRNA-seq and ST-seq revealed characteristic clusters associated with TP high-risk subtypes, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of key genes. We conducted functional enrichment analysis, transcription factor activity inference, cell-cell interaction, drug efficacy analysis, and mutation information analysis to identify a novel subtype of HCC. Our analyses constructed a robust HCC prognostic risk prediction model. The patients with TP-TME high-risk subtypes predominantly exhibit hypoxia and activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin, Notch, and TGF-beta signaling pathways. Furthermore, we identified a novel subtype, XPO1+Epithelial. This subtype expresses signatures of the TP risk subtype and aligns with the biological behavior of high-risk patients. Additional analyses revealed that XPO1+Epithelial is influenced primarily by fibroblasts via ligand-receptor interactions, such as FN1-(ITGAV+ITGB1), and constitute a significant component of the TP-TME subtype. Moreover, XPO1+Epithelial interact with monocytes/macrophages, T/NK cells, and endothelial cells through ligand-receptor pairs, including MIF-(CD74+CXCR4), MIF-(CD74+CD44), and VEGFA-VEGFR1R2, respectively, thereby promoting the recruitment of immune-suppressive cells and angiogenesis. The ST-seq cohort treated with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) and Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) presented elevated levels of TP and TME risk subtype signature genes, as well as XPO1+Epithelial, T-cell, and endothelial cell infiltration in the treatment response group. Drug sensitivity analyses indicated that TP-TME high-risk subtypes, including sorafenib and pembrolizumab, were associated with sensitivity to multiple drugs. Further exploratory analyses revealed that CTLA4, PDCD1, and the cancer antigens MSLN, MUC1, EPCAM, and PROM1 presented significantly increase expression levels in the high-risk subtype group. This study constructed a robust prognostic model for HCC and identified novel subgroups at the single-cell level, potentially assisting in the assessment of prognostic risk for HCC patients and facilitating personalized drug therapy.

Abstract: The application of multi\u2011omics methodologies, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and integrative genomics, has markedly enhanced the understanding of prostate cancer (PCa). These methods have facilitated the identification of molecular pathways and biomarkers crucial for the early detection, prognostic evaluation and personalized treatment of PCa. Studies using multi\u2011omics technologies have elucidated how alterations in gene expression and protein interactions contribute to PCa progression and treatment resistance. Furthermore, the integration of multi\u2011omics data has been used in the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of innovative treatment modalities, such as precision medicine. The evolving landscape of multi\u2011omics research holds promise for not only deepening the understanding of PCa biology but also for fostering the development of more effective and tailored therapeutic interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The present review aims to synthesize current findings from multi\u2011omics studies associated with PCa and to assess their implications for the improvement of patient management and therapeutic outcomes. The insights provided may guide future research directions and clinical practices in the fight against PCa. Journal: Molecular medicine reports. Year: 2025. Authors: Yan L, Su P, Sun X.

Abstract: The \"HER2-low\" nomenclature identifies breast carcinomas (BCs) displaying a HER2 score of 1+/2+ in immunohistochemistry and lacking ERBB2 amplification. Whether HER2-low BCs (HLBCs) constitute a distinct entity is debated. We performed DNA and RNA high-throughput analysis on 99 HLBC samples (n = 34 cases with HER2 score 1+/HLBC-1, n = 15 cases with HER2 score 2+ and ERBB2 not amplified/HLBC-2N, and n = 50 cases with score 2+ and ERBB2 copy number in the equivocal range/HLBC-2E). We compared the mutation rates with data from 1317 samples in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) BC cohort and gene expression data with those from an internal cohort of HER2-negative and HER2-positive BCs. The most represented mutations affected PIK3CA (31/99, 31%), GATA3 (18/99, 18%), TP53 (17/99, 17%), and ERBB2 (8/99, 8%, private to HLBC-2E). Tumor mutational burden was significantly higher in HLBC-1 compared to HLBC-2E/N (P = 0.04). Comparison of mutation spectra revealed that HLBCs were different from both HER2-negative and HER2-positive BCs, with HLBC-1 resembling more HER2-negative tumors and HLBC-2 mutationally related to HER2-addicted tumors. Potentially actionable alterations (annotated by using OncoKB/ESCAT classes) affected 52 patients. Intra-group gene expression revealed overlapping features between HLBC-1 and control HER2-negative BCs, whereas the HLBC-2E tumors showed the highest diversity overall. The RNA-based class discovery analysis unveiled four subsets of tumors with (i) lymphocyte activation, (ii) unique enrichment in HER2-related features, (iii) stromal remodeling alterations, and (iv) actionability of PIK3CA mutations (LAURA classification). HLBCs harbor distinct genomic features when compared with HER2-positive and HER2-negative BCs; however, differences across IHC classes were also unveiled thus dissecting the full picture of heterogeneity across HER2-low disease. The HLBC-2E category harbors most distinctive features, whereas HLBC-1 seems superimposable to HER2-negative disease. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether the four genomic-driver classes of the LAURA classification hold prognostic and/or predictive implications. Journal: Genome medicine. Year: 2022.

However, overall survival from relapsed disease has shown improvement despite a lack of increase in progression-free survival. There are now many therapeutic options for women with relapsed disease. Treatment strategies are still led by the description of relapse as platinum sensitive or resistant/refractory using somewhat arbitrary definitions. Now that there is increased choice of treatment, these definitions are becoming outdated. The current challenges in managing relapsed ovarian cancer are defining the optimal sequence of available drugs as well as timing of treatment for relapsed disease. The abundance of novel therapeutics and molecular targets has compounded the difficulty in identifying best practice but has undoubtedly provided an opportunity to improve the treatment we can offer our patients. The lack of validated biomarkers to inform patient selection remains an area of real need in ovarian cancer. Efforts should be made to increase the use of biomarkers in trial design to aid rational targeting of new therapies. In this review we discuss current practice in the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer and highlight the most promising emerging therapeutics and strategies being employed in randomized clinical trials.

Here we review 149 articles concerning molecular mechanisms of TLR2/4 agonists, alone or in combination with chemotherapy. It appears that TLR2/4 agonists induce a well controlled tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion, at plasma levels known to permeabilize neoangiogenic tumor vessels to the passage of cytotoxic drugs. Moreover, TLR2/4 agonists induce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and nitric oxide is able to induce apoptosis of chemotherapy-resistant tumor cell clones. Finally, TLR2/4-stimulation activates dendritic cell traffic and its associated tumor-specific, cytotoxic T-cell responses. Therefore, parenteral TLR2/4 agonists seem promising molecules to prolong survival in cancer patients who relapse under chemotherapy. Journal: European journal of pharmacology. Year: 2007.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by clonal heterogeneity, leading to frequent relapses and drug resistance despite intensive clinical therapy. Although AML's clonal architecture has been addressed in many studies, practical monitoring of dynamic changes in those subclones during relapse and treatment is still understudied. Fifteen longitudinal bone marrow (BM) samples were collected from three relapsed and refractory (R/R) AML patients. Using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), the frequencies of patient's leukemic variants were assessed in seven cell populations that were isolated from each BM sample based on cellular phenotypes. By quantifying mutant clones at the diagnosis, remission, and relapse stages, the distribution of AML subclones was sequentially monitored. Minimal residual (MR) leukemic subclones exhibit heterogeneous distribution among BM cell populations, including mature leukocyte populations. During AML progression, these subclones undergo active phenotypic transitions and repopulate into distinct cell population regardless of normal hematopoiesis hierarchic order. Of these, MR subclones in progenitor populations of patient BM predominantly carry MR leukemic properties, leading to more robust expansion and stubborn persistence than those in mature populations. Moreover, a minor subset of MR leukemic subclones could be sustained at an extremely low frequency without clonal expansion during relapse. In this study, we observed treatment persistent MR leukemic subclones and their phenotypic changes during the treatment process of R/R AML patients. This underscores the importance of preemptive inhibition of clonal promiscuity in R/R AML, proposing a practical method for monitoring AML MR subclones. Journal: Cancer medicine. Year: 2024.

Abstract: A core tenet of precision oncology is the rational choice of drugs to interact with patient-specific biological targets of interest, but it is currently difficult for researchers to obtain consistent and well-supported target information for pharmaceutical drugs. We review current drug-target interaction resources and critically assess how supporting evidence is handled. We introduce the concept of a unified Cancer Targetome to aggregate drug-target interactions in an evidence-based framework. We discuss current unmet needs and the implications for evidence-based clinical omics. The focus of this review is precision oncology but the discussion is highly relevant to targeted therapies in any area. Journal: Trends in pharmacological sciences. Year: 2017.

Eighteen (32.7%) patients responded. The response rate was 38.5% (15 responses among 39 patients) in relapsing patients. Three (18.8%) of 16 patients with resistant myeloma responded. Granulocytopenia was the most frequent toxic effect, and was severe in 12 (22%) patients. Severe thrombocytopenia occurred in seven (13%) patients and severe nausea and vomiting occurred in eight (15%). One patient with previously normal renal function developed renal failure on this regimen. The median survival (100 weeks) in those patients responding to treatment was significantly longer than that in patients not responding (25 weeks; P = 0.001). VBAP plus cisplatin and bleomycin was at least as effective as VBAP but had greater toxicity, expense, and inconvenience; it therefore is not preferable to VBAP. Journal: Cancer treatment reports.

Abstract: Complete responses have been observed in NPM1-mutated AML patients with dactinomycin, a nucleolar stress-inducing drug. Here, we report a single-center experience of compassionate use of dactinomycin in untreated or relapsed/ refractory NPM1-mutated AML. From September 2015 to February 2019, 26 adult patients with NPM1-mutated AML received dactinomycin in different situations: front-line treatment in 4 unfit patients (16%); morphologic (n\u00a0=\u00a016, 62%), molecular relapses (n\u00a0=\u00a04, 16%), refractory disease (n\u00a0=\u00a01, 13%), or postremission therapy in second complete response (n\u00a0=\u00a01, 13%). Median age was 62.5 years. Median number of dactinomycin cycle was 1 (1-8), and 7 patients (27%) received more than 3 cycles. Three out of 17 patients (18%) in morphologic relapse or refractory to chemotherapy achieved complete remission after the first cycle of dactinomycin. None of the 4 patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy responded to dactinomycin as front-line therapy. Grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (n\u00a0=\u00a011, 42%), neutropenia (n\u00a0=\u00a011, 42%), GI toxicity (n\u00a0=\u00a06, 23%), mucositis (n\u00a0=\u00a05, 19%), lung infection (n\u00a0=\u00a05, 19%), and skin rash (n\u00a0=\u00a02, 7.6%). Dactinomycin is an inexpensive and easily available drug that may induce significant responses in few AML patients with NPM1 mutations with an acceptable safety profile.

Abstract: Experimental animal tumor models have been broadly used to evaluate anticancer drugs in the preclinical setting. They have also been widely applied for drug target discovery and validation, which usually follows four experimental strategies: first, assess the roles of putative drug targets using in vivo tumorigenicity and tumor growth kinetics assays of transplanted tumors, engineered through gain-of-function (GOF) by overexpressing transgene or knock-in (KI) or loss-of-function by gene silencing using knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) or mutation via mutagenesis procedures; second, similarly genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM), through either germline or somatic cell procedures, are used to test the roles of potential targets in spontaneous tumorigenicity assays; third, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), which most closely resemble patient genetics and histopathology, are used in tumor inhibition assays for evaluating target-/pathway-specific inhibitors, including large and small molecules, thus assessing the drug target; and fourth, the targets can be assessed in population-based trials, mouse clinical trials (MCT), so that the validation can be generally meaningful as performed in human clinical trials. This chapter outlines the commonly used protocols in cancer drug target research: the first four sections describe four sets of different, specific pharmacology protocols used in the respective cancer modeling stages, with the last section summarizing the common protocols applicable to all four pharmacology modeling steps.

Open, prospective study.. Abstract: Aggressive non-melanoma skin cancer (deeply infiltrating, recurrent, and morphea form lesions) are therapeutically challenging because they require considerable tissue loss and may demand radical disfiguring surgery. Interferons (IFN) may provide a non-surgical approach to the management of these tumors. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of a formulation containing IFNs-alpha and -gamma in synergistic proportions on patients with recurrent, advanced basal cell (BCC) or squamous cell skin carcinomas (SCSC). Patients with extensive, recurrent, resistant to other procedures BCC or SCSC received the IFN formulation peri- and intralesionally, three times per week for 3 weeks. They had been previously treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Thirteen weeks after the end of treatment, the original lesion sites were examined for histological evidence of remaining tumor. Sixteen elder (median 70 years-old) patients were included. They beared 12 BCC and 4 SCSC ranging from 1.5 to 12.5 cm in the longest dimension. At the end of treatment 47% CR (complete tumor elimination), 40% PR (>30% tumor reduction), and 13% stable disease were obtained. None of the patients relapsed during the treatment period. The median duration of the response was 38 months. Only one patient with complete response had relapsed until today. Principal adverse reactions were influenza-like symptoms well known to occur with interferon therapy, which were well tolerated. The peri- and intralesional combination of IFNs-alpha and -gamma was safe and showed effect for the treatment of advanced, recurrent and resistant to previous treatments of BCC and SCSC in elder patients. This is the first report of such treatment in patients with advance non-melanoma skin cancer. The encouraging result justifies further confirmatory trials. Current Controlled Trials RPCEC00000052.

Abstract: T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that represent 10%-15% of all NHLs. The prognosis of relapsed T-cell NHL is poor, especially for those relapsing after an autologous (auto-) or allogeneic (allo-) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Disease relapse post auto-HCT is best managed on a clinical trial. In the absence of an investigational protocol, the choice of salvage therapies should take into account patient performance status, eligibility for an allo-HCT, and surface CD30 expression. CD30-directed therapies or aggressive salvage regimens can be used as a bridge to allo-HCT in medically fit patients. In the elderly or more infirm patients, single-agent therapies could be offered, aiming at palliation. Similarly, relapse after an allo-HCT is not uncommon and is a real challenge. Reduction in ongoing immune suppression or donor lymphocyte infusion are often considered in this setting to augment graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effects and can occasionally provide durable disease control. Clinical trials designed to investigate novel therapeutic agents with immunomodulatory properties to augment GVL effects (eg, histone deacetylase [HDAC] inhibitors, proteasome inhibitor, lenalidomide) or targeted therapies (eg, aurora A kinase inhibitors, anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] inhibitors) are sorely needed to improve the dismal outcomes of T-cell NHL relapsing after an allo-HCT.

Abstract: We apply endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy to cytopathologically diagnose and sample nucleic acids from primary tumours regardless of the disease stage. 397 patients with proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma were included and followed up in a multicentre prospective study. DNA and mRNA were extracted from materials of primary tumours obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy and analysed using targeted deep sequencing and RNAseq respectively. The variant allele frequency of the KRAS mutation was used to evaluate the tumour cellularity, ranging from 15 to 20% in all cells, regardless of the tumour stage. The molecular profile of metastatic primary tumours significantly differed from other types of tumours, more frequently having TP53 mutations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002), less frequently having RNF43 mutations, and possessing more basal-like mRNA component (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Molecular markers associated with improved overall survival were: mutations in homologous recombination deficiency genes in patients who received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025) and wild-type TP53 gene in patients with locally advanced tumours who received radio-chemotherapy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The GemPred transcriptomic profile was associated with a significantly better overall survival in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who received a gemcitabine-based first-line treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019). The combination of genomic and transcriptomic analyses of primary pancreatic tumours enables us to distinguish metastatic tumours from other tumour types. Our molecular strategy may assist in predicting overall survival outcomes for platinum or gemcitabine-based chemotherapies, as well as radio-chemotherapy.

For relapse \u2264 6 months of initial therapy, sequential therapy with single agents is recommended. Clinical trial enrollment should be considered at all stages of treatment of SCLC. This review highlights the available treatment options in relapsed SCLC. In particular, we focus on prospective clinical trials demonstrating activity for the most commonly used agents in this setting. We end with a discussion on future directions and emerging targets with potential to improve outcomes in relapsed SCLC. Journal: Journal of oncology practice. Year: 2018. Authors: Gong J, Salgia R.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.. Abstract: The introduction of several novel and active treatments and improvements in supportive care of myeloma patients has resulted in a prolongation of the survival of these patients. However, myeloma remains an incurable disease and almost all patients will relapse. Effective management of the relapsing/refractory disease incorporates several different strategies, depending on prior treatments, responses, and duration of responses, as well as residual toxicity, age, and physical condition. High-dose dexamethasone still has a role in the management of disease complications such as cytopenias, renal impairment, or spinal cord compression until another agent is added. High-dose therapy may be considered for selected patients who have a long-term treatment-free interval after their first transplantation. Allogeneic transplantation is limited to selected young patients, preferably with an HLA-matched donor. However, the backbone of current strategies for the management of relapsed/refractory myeloma includes the novel agents thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide. These agents, either with dexamethasone or in combination with chemotherapy, have shown significant activity both in relapsed and in refractory patients. Based on the results of phase III trials, lenalidomide and bortezomib have increased the post-relapse survival and are active in patients who have received prior novel agents; lenalidomide is active in thalidomide-pretreated or bortezomib-pretreated patients and bortezomib alone or in combination with chemotherapy is active in thalidomide/lenalidomide-pretreated patients. Combinations of novel agents show synergistic activity and may overcome drug resistance. Finally, special consideration is needed for the management of patients with renal impairment or other poor prognostic features. Journal: Seminars in hematology. Year: 2009.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Pemetrexed in the treatment of relapsed/refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma.. Abstract: Despite initial treatment with high-dose methotrexate-based regimens, many patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) relapse and die from their disease. No standard of care exists at progression or relapse, but chemotherapy and in some cases radiation are usually used. Pemetrexed is a multitargeted antifolate, similar to methotrexate, but with a broader spectrum of activity. Because methotrexate is an integral part of PCSNL treatment, the authors assessed the antitumor activity and safety of pemetrexed in recurrent PCNSL. Patients with relapsed/refractory PCNSL were enrolled in this trial. Treatment consisted of pemetrexed 900 mg/m(2) given every 3 weeks with low-dose dexamethasone, folate, and B12 supplementation. Each cycle was 6 weeks, and follow-up imaging was done before each new cycle. Treatment was continued until complete remission, progression, or toxicity. Eleven patients were treated, with a median age of 69.8 years and Karnofsky performance status of 70%; 10 of 11 patients had failed prior high-dose methotrexate. The median number of pemetrexed cycles given was 5, with an associated overall response rate of 55% and disease control rate of 91%. The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 45%, median PFS was 5.7 months, and median overall survival was 10.1 months. Toxicities were primarily hematologic and infectious. Pemetrexed has single-agent activity in relapsed/refractory PCNSL. Toxicities were seen likely because of the higher than standard dose used. Further investigation of this agent or other multitargeted antifolates in PCNSL is warranted to determine optimal dose and efficacy in a more homogeneous population. Journal: Cancer. Year: 2012.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Combinatorial nanocarriers against drug resistance in hematological cancers: Opportunities and emerging strategies.. Abstract: Hematological cancers are a group of malignancies affecting human hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Although the patients respond to treatment regimen during initial phases, the hematoma tumor heterogeneity results in the presence of some minimal disease residue thereby exhibiting remission, relapses or refractoriness in disease conditions leading to poor overall survival period. The current therapeutic standard practices involve blending of conventional agents with novel targeting agents or immune-therapeutics in a cocktail to effectively reap the benefits of drugs acting through multiple signaling pathways. Considerable evaluation of the risk benefit ratio on part of clinicians is necessitated to select the best optimum therapy considering the high incidences of drug resistance. This drug resistance may be attributed to faulty upregulation or mutation of multiple drug resistance regulating genes, increased tumor cell immune system cross talk, increased expression of drug efflux pump inducers and inhibition of apoptosis among others. Conventional single drug nanotherapeutics as modulators of drug resistance have already clinically exhibited their potential by passively delivering the active cargo to desired targets in hematological neoplasms. However, with the ever-growing clinical failures of such therapies, the landscape of hematological cancer treatment has seen a plethora of changes in the last few years. The two towering changes in the treatment has been the approval of combinatorial drug nanocarrier Vyxeos\u2122 and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy Kymriah\u2122 as well as Yescarta\u2122. The approval of CAR-T therapy not only resulted in a paradigm shift in the avenues of blood cancer treatment towards personalized approaches but also saddled it with questions of economic viability and effectiveness in the entire spectrum of such neoplasms. Under such conditions, combinatorial drug nanocarriers encompassing synergistic ratios of clinically effective drug combinations affording temporal and spatial control present an exciting approach to overcome these drug resistance modalities. This platform provides increased chances of therapeutic in-vitro in-vivo correlation along with minimization of drug resistance and associated disease relapse conditions. The present review intends to present the current preclinical and clinical advances in combinatorial nanocarrier mediated management of drug resistance in hematological cancers.

Abstract: <b><i>Background:</i></b> Breast cancer (BC) in women is the most common malignancy worldwide, but there is still a lack of validated tools to accurately assess patient prognosis and response to available chemotherapy treatment regimens. <b><i>Method:</i></b> We collected ultrasound images and transcriptome data of BC from our breast center and public database. Key ultrasound features were then identified by using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and correlated with prognostic genes. Long-term survival-related genes were identified through differential expression analysis, and a prognostic evaluation model was established by using Cox regression. In addition, <i>VPS28</i> from the model was identified as a promising biomarker for BC. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Using univariate logistic regression and SVM algorithms, we identified 12 ultrasound features significantly associated with chemotherapy response. Subsequent correlation and differential expression analyses linked 401 genes to these features, from which five key signature genes were derived using Lasso and multivariate Cox regression models. This signature not only facilitates the stratification of patients into risk-specific treatment pathways but also predicts their chemotherapy response, thus supporting personalized medicine in clinical settings. Notably, <i>VPS28</i>, in the signature, emerged as a significant biomarker, strongly associated with poor prognosis, greater tumor invasiveness, and differing expression across demographic groups. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> In this study, we use ultrasound genomics to reveal a signature that can provide an effective tool for prognostic assessment and predicting chemotherapy response in patients with BC.

Abstract: With steadily improved cure rates for children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), treating relapsed ALL has become increasingly challenging largely due to resistance to salvage therapy. Improved biological understanding of mechanisms of relapse and drug resistance, the identification of actionable molecular targets by studying leukaemic cell and host genetics, precise risk stratification with minimum residual disease measurement, and the development of new therapeutic drugs and approaches are needed to improve outcomes of relapsed patients. Molecularly targeted therapies and innovative immunotherapeutic approaches that include specialised monoclonal antibodies and cellular therapies hold promise of enhanced leukaemia cell killing with non-overlapping toxicities.

Abstract: There is a need for novel therapies for patients with previously treated HER2-positive gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA). This phase 1 (NCT02892123) dose-escalation and expansion trial evaluated zanidatamab (a dual HER2-targeted bispecific antibody) \u00b1 chemotherapy in previously treated patients with HER2-expressing, locally advanced/metastatic cancers. Here, we report the outcomes for GEA cohorts receiving zanidatamab monotherapy or with chemotherapy (paclitaxel or capecitabine). The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate, progression-free survival, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Seventy patients were enrolled (n\u2009=\u200929 monotherapy; n\u2009=\u200941 combination therapy); most received prior HER2-targeted agents (monotherapy, 93%; combination therapy, 95%). With monotherapy, 69% of patients had any-grade treatment-related AEs (TRAEs); 17% had grade \u2265\u00a03 TRAEs. The most common any-grade TRAEs were diarrhea (41%) and infusion-related reactions (24%). With combination therapy, 98% of patients had any-grade TRAEs; 51% had grade \u2265\u00a03 TRAEs. The most common any-grade TRAEs were diarrhea (68%) and fatigue (44%). Confirmed ORR was 32.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.9-52.4) with monotherapy and 48.6% (95% CI 31.9-65.6) with combination therapy. In heavily pre-treated patients with HER2-expressing GEA, zanidatamab \u00b1 chemotherapy had a manageable safety profile and promising antitumor activity. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Children and adolescents with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and mature B-cell leukemia (B-ALL) have an excellent prognosis with contemporary chemotherapy stratified according to the histologic subtype and clinical stage of disease. However, a small subset of patients does not respond to front-line therapy or suffers from an early relapse. A retrospective analysis was performed to assess the incidence, treatment, and outcome of all children with relapsed or progressed NHL and B-ALL diagnosed in Austria between 1986 and 2003 (n = 22/234). Nine of 140 (6.5%) patients with B-cell NHL/B-ALL (relapse, n = 6; progress, n = 3) failed initial treatment. Four of them underwent a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as second-line therapy, two patients received intensive chemotherapy alone and in three patients treatment was palliative. Eight of the nine patients died of their disease. Four of 65 (6%) patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) (relapse, n = 2; progress, n = 2) had a treatment failure. High-dose chemotherapy followed by HSCT was performed in two of the four patients; another two patients received chemotherapy alone. Three of the four patients died of resistant disease. Nine of 29 (31%) patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (relapse, n = 7; progress, n = 2) failed first-line therapy. Six underwent a HSCT (autologous, n = 3; allogeneic, n = 3) and are currently in second complete remission. Treatment of the other three patients consisted of chemotherapy alone-they all died of tumor progression. Conclusively, patients with early relapsed and progressive B-cell neoplasia or LBL have a very poor prognosis with current treatment approaches, while those with ALCL have a respectable chance to achieve a sustained complete second remission with high-dose chemotherapy and HSCT.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular mechanisms of Hippo pathway in tumorigenesis: therapeutic implications.. Abstract: The Hippo signaling pathway is a pivotal regulator of tissue homeostasis, organ size, and cell proliferation. Its dysregulation is profoundly implicated in various forms of cancer, making it a highly promising target for therapeutic intervention. This review extensively evaluates the mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of the Hippo pathway in cancer cells and the molecular processes linking these alterations to tumorigenesis. Under normal physiological conditions, the Hippo pathway is a guardian, ensuring controlled cellular proliferation and programmed cell death. However, numerous mutations and epigenetic modifications can disrupt this equilibrium in cancer cells, leading to unchecked cell proliferation, enhanced survival, and metastatic capabilities. The pathway's interaction with other critical signaling networks, including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, PI3K/Akt, TGF-\u03b2/SMAD, and EGFR pathways, further amplifies its oncogenic potential. Central to these disruptions is the activation of YAP and TAZ transcriptional coactivators, which drive the expression of genes that promote oncogenesis. This review delves into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the dysregulation of the Hippo pathway in cancer, elucidating how these disruptions contribute to tumorigenesis. We also explore potential therapeutic strategies, including inhibitors targeting YAP/TAZ activity and modulators of upstream signaling components. Despite significant advancements in understanding the Hippo pathway's role in cancer, numerous questions remain unresolved. Continued research is imperative to unravel the complex interactions within this pathway and to develop innovative and effective therapies for clinical application. In conclusion, the comprehensive understanding of the Hippo pathway's regulatory mechanisms offers significant potential for advancing cancer therapies, regenerative medicine, and treatments for chronic diseases. The translation of these insights into clinical practice will necessitate collaborative efforts from researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical developers to bring novel and effective therapies to patients, ultimately improving clinical outcomes and advancing the field of oncology.

This protein, located both in the cytoplasmic and the nucleus, is expressed in various tissues and is regulated in response to a wide range of extracellular stimuli. TCTP interacts with itself and other protein including MCL1 and p53. TCTP has been shown to play an important role in physiological events, such as cell proliferation, cell death and immune responses but also in stress response and tumor reversion. Moreover, TCTP expression is associated with malignancy and chemoresistance. In this review, we will evaluate pathways regulated by TCTP and current inhibitory strategy to target TCTP in cancerous diseases. Journal: Cancer treatment reviews. Year: 2014.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths and there currently is no reliable modality for the early detection of this disease. Here, we identify cancer-specific promoter DNA methylation of BNC1 and ADAMTS1 as a promising biomarker detection strategy meriting investigation in pancreatic cancer. We used a genome-wide pharmacologic transcriptome approach to identify novel cancer-specific DNA methylation alterations in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Of eight promising genes, we focused our studies on BNC1 and ADAMTS1 for further downstream analysis, including methylation and expression. We used a nanoparticle-enabled methylation on beads (MOB) technology to detect early-stage pancreatic cancers by analyzing DNA methylation in patient serum. We identified two novel genes, BNC1 (92%) and ADAMTS1 (68%), that showed a high frequency of methylation in pancreatic cancers (n = 143), up to 100% in PanIN-3 and 97% in stage I invasive cancers. Using the nanoparticle-enabled MOB technology, these alterations could be detected in serum samples (n = 42) from patients with pancreatic cancer, with a sensitivity for BNC1 of 79% [95% confidence interval (CI), 66%-91%] and for ADAMTS1 of 48% (95% CI, 33%-63%), whereas specificity was 89% for BNC1 (95% CI, 76%-100%) and 92% for ADAMTS1 (95% CI, 82%-100%). Overall sensitivity using both markers is 81% (95% CI, 69%-93%) and specificity is 85% (95% CI, 71%-99%). Promoter DNA methylation of BNC1 and ADAMTS1 is a potential biomarker to detect early-stage pancreatic cancers. Assaying the promoter methylation status of these genes in circulating DNA from serum is a promising strategy for early detection of pancreatic cancer and has the potential to improve mortality from this disease.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Identification of a 5-gene signature panel for the prediction of prostate cancer progression.. Abstract: Despite nearly 100% 5-year survival for localised prostate cancer, the survival rate for metastatic prostate cancer significantly declines to 32%. Thus, it is crucial to identify molecular indicators that reflect the progression from localised disease to metastatic prostate cancer. To search for molecular indicators associated with prostate cancer metastasis, we performed proteomic analysis of rapid autopsy tissue samples from metastatic prostate cancer (N\u2009=\u20098) and localised prostate cancer (N\u2009=\u20092). Then, we utilised multiple independent, publicly available prostate cancer patient datasets to select candidates that also correlate with worse prostate cancer clinical prognosis. We identified 154 proteins with increased expressions in metastases relative to localised prostate cancer through proteomic analysis. From the subset of these candidates that correlate with prostate cancer recurrence (N\u2009=\u200928) and shorter disease-free survival (N\u2009=\u200937), we identified a 5-gene signature panel with improved performance in predicting worse clinical prognosis relative to individual candidates. Our study presents a new 5-gene signature panel that is associated with worse clinical prognosis and is elevated in prostate cancer metastasis on both protein and mRNA levels. Our 5-gene signature panel represents a potential modality for the prediction of prostate cancer progression towards the onset of metastasis. Journal: British journal of cancer. Year: 2024.

Abstract: This review outlines recently developed Prussian blue nanoparticle (PB NPs)-based multimodal imaging-guided chemo-photothermal strategies for cancer diagnosis and treatment in order to provide insight into the future of the field. The primary limitation of existing therapeutics is the lack of selectivity in drug delivery: they target healthy and cancerous cells alike. In this paper, we provide a thorough review of diverse synthetic and surface engineering techniques for PB NP fabrication. We have elucidated the various targeting approaches employed to deliver the therapeutic and imaging ligands into the tumor area, and outlined methods for enhancement of the tumor ablative ability of the NPS, including several important combinatorial approaches. In addition, we have summarized different in vitro and in vivo effects of PB NP-based therapies used to overcome both systemic and tumor-associated local barriers. An important new approach - PB NP-based immune drug delivery, which is an exciting and promising strategy to overcome cancer resistance and tumor recurrence - has been discussed. Finally, we have discussed the current understanding of the toxicological effects of PB NPs and PB NP-based therapeutics. We conclude that PB NP-based multimodal imaging-guided chemo-photothermal therapy offers new treatment strategies to overcome current hurdles in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The isomerase PIN1 controls numerous cancer-driving pathways and is a unique drug target.. Abstract: Targeted drugs have changed cancer treatment but are often ineffective in the long term against solid tumours, largely because of the activation of heterogeneous oncogenic pathways. A central common signalling mechanism in many of these pathways is proline-directed phosphorylation, which is regulated by many kinases and phosphatases. The structure and function of these phosphorylated proteins are further controlled by a single proline isomerase: PIN1. PIN1 is overactivated in cancers and it promotes cancer and cancer stem cells by disrupting the balance of oncogenes and tumour suppressors. This Review discusses the roles of PIN1 in cancer and the potential of PIN1 inhibitors to restore this balance. Journal: Nature reviews. Cancer. Year: 2016. Authors: Zhou XZ, Lu KP.

Abstract: Development of new oncology drugs has increased since the improved understanding of cancer's complex biology. The oncology field has become the top therapeutic research area for new drugs. However, only a limited number of drugs entering clinical trials will be approved for use as the standard of care for cancer patients. Molecular imaging is increasingly perceived as a tool to support go/no-go decisions early during drug development. It encompasses a wide range of techniques that include radiolabeling a compound of interest followed by visualization with SPECT or PET. Radiolabeling can be performed using a variety of radionuclides, which are preferably matched to the compound on the basis of size and half-life. Imaging can provide information on drug behavior in vivo, whole-body drug target visualization, and heterogeneity in drug target expression. This review focuses on current applications of molecular imaging in the development of small molecules, antibodies, and antihormonal anticancer drugs.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the second most common and the most lethal of the gynecological malignancies. Currently, there exists no effective screening tool for OC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 18-23 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that refine gene expression. MiRNAs have been found to be aberrantly expressed in OC tumor tissue as well as detectable in biological fluids such as the blood, urine, and ascites and have been proposed as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for OC. Areas covered: This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the application of miRNAs as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers in OC. It describes the various tissues allowing for the analysis of miRNAs such as tumor tissue, blood, ascites and urine. It also highlights the potential of miRNAs as a therapy in other cancers and how these therapies may be applied to ovarian cancer. Expert opinion: The study of miRNAs is an innovative and promising field for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. Methodological issues surrounding their detection and application therapeutically remain, such as the study of various OC histotypes within the same cohort, the choice of 'normal tissue' for comparison and the difficulties surrounding the choice of a normalization miRNA.

Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: During cancer progression, tumor cells develop several mechanisms to prevent killing and to shape the immune system into a tumor-promoting environment. One of such regulatory mechanism is the overexpression of sialic acid (Sia) on carbohydrates of proteins and lipids on tumor cells. Sia-containing glycans or sialoglycans were shown to inhibit immune effector functions of NK cells and T cells by engaging inhibitory Siglec receptors on the surface of these cells. They can also modulate the differentiation of myeloid cells into tumor-promoting M2 macrophages. <b>Areas covered</b>: We review the role of sialoglycans in cancer and introduce the Siglecs, their expression on different immune cells and their interaction with cancer-associated sialoglycans. The targeting of this sialoglycan-Siglec glyco-immune checkpoint is discussed along with potential therapeutic approaches. Pubmed was searched for publications on Siglecs, sialic acid, and cancer. <b>Expert opinion</b>: The targeting of sialoglycan-Siglec interactions has become a major focus in cancer research. New approaches have been developed that directly target sialic acids in tumor lesions. Targeted sialidases that cleave sialic acid specifically in the tumor, have already shown efficacy; efforts targeting the sialoglycan-Siglec pathway for improvement of CAR T cell therapy are ongoing. The sialoglycan-Siglec immune checkpoint is a promising new target for cancer immunotherapy. Journal: Expert opinion on therapeutic targets. Year: 2019. Authors: B\u00e4renwaldt A, L\u00e4ubli H.

Abstract: Cancer\u2011related deaths remain a challenging and devastating obstacle to defeat despite the tremendous advances in cancer treatment. Cancer metastasis is the major cause of these cancer\u2011related deaths. Metastasis involves sequential steps during cancer cells' journey to a new site. These steps are coordinately regulated by specific intracellular regulators and cellular interactions between the cancer cells and the supporting microenvironment of the different organs. The development of aptamer\u2011based therapeutics is a promising strategy to fight cancer metastasis as it holds potential advantages. Oligonucleotide and peptide aptamers are short sequences of single\u2011stranded nucleic acids or amino acids, respectively, that target proteins, genetic materials, and cells. Antimetastatic aptamer\u2011based therapeutics exert their pharmacological effect by direct interaction with the signaling pathways inside the cancer cells or the communications between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. In addition, aptamers have been utilized as a guiding ligand to deliver a therapeutic moiety to cancer cells or the supporting microenvironment. The selected aptamer possesses high specificity since it is designed to recognize and interact with its target. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of aptamer\u2011based therapeutics targeting mediators of cancer metastasis. In addition, potential opportunities are discussed to inspire researchers in the field to develop novel aptamer\u2011based antimetastatic treatments. Journal: International journal of oncology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Transforming brain cancer therapeutics: unlocking the power of blood-brain barrier-targeting strategies for superior treatment outcomes and precision medicine.. Abstract: The treatment of brain tumors is significantly hindered by the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), a selective barrier that restricts the passage of therapeutic agents to the brain. Recent advancements in BBB-targeting therapies offer promising strategies to overcome this challenge, providing new avenues for the effective treatment of brain cancer. This article reviews innovative approaches, including Convection-Enhanced Delivery (CED) and RNA-based therapeutics, which enhance drug delivery directly to tumor sites, bypassing the BBB and reducing systemic toxicity. Additionally, the use of theranostic nanoparticles and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing presents novel opportunities for real-time monitoring and precision-targeted therapy, respectively. Techniques such as magnetic nanoparticles, intranasal drug administration, and focused ultrasound with microbubbles are also being refined to improve drug penetration across the BBB. Furthermore, peptide-based delivery systems and small molecules designed to mimic endogenous transport pathways are accelerating the discovery of more effective therapies. The exploration of combination therapies that synergize BBB-penetrant drugs with conventional chemotherapeutic agents or immunotherapies holds the potential to enhance treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. Continued research and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to develop predictive models, personalized treatment strategies, and alternative delivery methods that ensure the long-term safety and effectiveness of these novel therapies. Advancements in BBB-targeting therapeutics are poised to transform the landscape of brain cancer treatment, offering renewed hope for improved survival rates and quality of life for patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Pediatric T-ALL type-1 and type-2 relapses develop along distinct pathways of clonal evolution.. Abstract: The mechanisms underlying T-ALL relapse remain essentially unknown. Multilevel-omics in 38 matched pairs of initial and relapsed T-ALL revealed 18 (47%) type-1 (defined by being derived from the major ancestral clone) and 20 (53%) type-2 relapses (derived from a minor ancestral clone). In both types of relapse, we observed known and novel drivers of multidrug resistance including MDR1 and MVP, NT5C2 and JAK-STAT activators. Patients with type-1 relapses were specifically characterized by IL7R upregulation. In remarkable contrast, type-2 relapses demonstrated (1) enrichment of constitutional cancer predisposition gene mutations, (2) divergent genetic and epigenetic remodeling, and (3) enrichment of somatic hypermutator phenotypes, related to BLM, BUB1B/PMS2 and TP53 mutations. T-ALLs that later progressed to type-2 relapses exhibited a complex subclonal architecture, unexpectedly, already at the time of initial diagnosis. Deconvolution analysis of ATAC-Seq profiles showed that T-ALLs later developing into type-1 relapses resembled a predominant immature thymic T-cell population, whereas T-ALLs developing into type-2 relapses resembled a mixture of normal T-cell precursors. In sum, our analyses revealed fundamentally different mechanisms driving either type-1 or type-2 T-ALL relapse and indicate that differential capacities of disease evolution are already inherent to the molecular setup of the initial leukemia.

Abstract: Humans are home to a diverse community of bacteria, many of which form symbiotic relationships with their host. Notably, tumors can also harbor their own unique bacterial populations that can influence tumor growth and progression. These bacteria, which selectively colonize hypoxic and acidic tumor microenvironments, present a novel therapeutic strategy to combat cancer. Advancements in synthetic biology enable us to safely and efficiently program therapeutic drug production in bacteria, further enhancing their potential. This review provides a comprehensive guide to utilizing bacteria for cancer treatment. We discuss key considerations for selecting bacterial strains, emphasizing their colonization efficiency, the delicate balance between safety and anti-tumor efficacy, and the availability of tools for genetic engineering. We also delve into strategies for precise spatiotemporal control of drug delivery to minimize adverse effects and maximize therapeutic impact, exploring recent examples of engineered bacteria designed to combat tumors. Finally, we address the underlying challenges and future prospects of bacterial cancer therapy. This review underscores the versatility of bacterial therapies and outlines strategies to fully harness their potential in the fight against cancer. Journal: Advanced drug delivery reviews.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a malignant primary brain tumor that affects approximately 250,000 new patients per year worldwide. It is among the most difficult cancers to treat, and 5-year survival rates remain low. Standard therapies for glioblastoma include surgical resection, radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy. We conducted a search of the literature on therapeutic options for glioblastoma on Pubmed. We also searched abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Society for Neuro-Oncology, European Association of Neuro-Oncology and American Association for Cancer Research. We also searched the U.S. National Library of Medicine clinical trials database. We discuss therapeutic options for newly diagnosed glioblastoma, mainly temozolomide, lomustine and tumor treating fields (TTF). Lastly, we discuss therapeutics for recurrent glioblastomas and agents under investigation in clinical trials. Enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged for both newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma patients. The standard post-operative treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients is a combination of radiotherapy and temozolomide. TTF devices can be used in conjunction with temozolomide. Available standard therapies for recurrent glioblastoma include nitrosureas, bevacizumab and temozolomide rechallenge, as well as TTF devices. Agents that are being evaluated in clinical trials include novel targeted therapies, novel chemotherapies, and immunotherapies. Journal: Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy. Year: 2022.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The mechanisms of Pin1 as targets for cancer therapy.. Abstract: Targeted therapy has considerable promise for the effective eradication of cancer at the primary tumor site prior to subsequent metastasis. Using this therapeutic approach, gaining an understanding of mechanistic cancer models is essential for facilitating the inhibition or suppression of tumor growth. Among different oncogenes and proteins, the protein interacting with never-in-mitosis kinase-1 (Pin1) is particularly important. The interaction between Pin1 and phosphorylated threonine-proline motifs results in significant alterations in protein structure and function. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the processes involving Pin1 and its mechanisms in the context of cancer therapy. Pin1 enhances signaling pathways in a number of different human cancers and plays a pivotal role in the suppressive mechanisms relevant to cancer treatment. It is essential for the regulation of proline-directed phosphorylation and for modulating tumor suppressors. Inhibitors of Pin1, particularly naturally occurring substances, have been found to inhibit the carcinogenic activity of Pin1, and consequently this protein could represent an excellent candidate for novel cancer treatment strategies, offering a valuable therapeutic target in carcinogenesis and treatment resistance.

    "name": "The ERK cascade inhibitors: Towards overcoming resistance.",
    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The ERK cascade inhibitors: Towards overcoming resistance.. Abstract: The RAS-ERK pathway plays a major regulatory role in various cellular processes. This pathway is hyperactivated and takes an active part in the malignant transformation of more than 85% of cancers. The hyperactivation is mainly due to oncogenic activating mutations in the pathway's components RAS, RAF and MEK, but also due to indirect mechanisms in cells transformed by other oncogenes. Various inhibitors targeting the different tiers of the cascade have been successfully developed and clinically approved, while some are still undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation. Treatments with the clinically approved RAF and MEK inhibitors have substantially improved the clinical outcome of metastatic mutated-BRAF melanoma. However, the rapid emergence of drug resistance of initially responsive cancers and limited efficacy towards other cancers has led to only marginal patient benefit. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic or acquired resistance is a necessity in order to enhance the treatment efficacy of ERK-addicted cancers. Therefore, many studies in the past 5 years embarked on this campaign, revealing several resistance mechanisms. These include, expression of drug-resistant RAF isoforms, molecular or genetic alterations of active downstream components, overexpression of upstream components of the cascade that can reactivate ERK and other survival-related pathways. The understanding of these molecular resistance mechanisms led to further development of drugs that can overcome drug resistance, including our own effort aiming to prevent the nuclear translocation of ERK without affecting its activation. In this review we will focus on the mechanisms underlying drug resistance and efforts to develop activity-independent, more efficacious, antitumor drugs.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Comprehensive genomic profiling of glioblastoma tumors, BTICs, and xenografts reveals stability and adaptation to growth environments.. Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most deadly brain tumor, and currently lacks effective treatment options. Brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) and orthotopic xenografts are widely used in investigating GBM biology and new therapies for this aggressive disease. However, the genomic characteristics and molecular resemblance of these models to GBM tumors remain undetermined. We used massively parallel sequencing technology to decode the genomes and transcriptomes of BTICs and xenografts and their matched tumors in order to delineate the potential impacts of the distinct growth environments. Using data generated from whole-genome sequencing of 201 samples and RNA sequencing of 118 samples, we show that BTICs and xenografts resemble their parental tumor at the genomic level but differ at the mRNA expression and epigenomic levels, likely due to the different growth environment for each sample type. These findings suggest that a comprehensive genomic understanding of in vitro and in vivo GBM model systems is crucial for interpreting data from drug screens, and can help control for biases introduced by cell-culture conditions and the microenvironment in mouse models. We also found that lack of <i>MGMT</i> expression in pretreated GBM is linked to hypermutation, which in turn contributes to increased genomic heterogeneity and requires new strategies for GBM treatment.

Here, we found that DDR signaling poises a series of epigenetic events, resulting in activation of pro-tumorigenic genes but can go as far as reactivation of the pluripotency gene OCT4. Loss of DNA methylation appears to be a key initiating event in DDR-dependent OCT4 locus reactivation although full reactivation required the presence of a driving oncogene, such as Myc and macroH2A downregulation. Using genetic-lineage-tracing experiments and an in situ labeling approach, we show that DDR-induced epigenetic reactivation of OCT4 regulates the resistance to chemotherapy and contributes to tumor relapse both in mouse and primary human cancers. In turn, deletion of OCT4 reverses chemoresistance and delays the relapse. Here, we uncovered an unexpected tumor-promoting role of DDR in cancer cell reprogramming, providing novel therapeutic entry points for cancer intervention strategies. Journal: Molecular cell.

Abstract: Single-cell multi-omics methods enable the study of cell state diversity, which is largely determined by the interplay of the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome. Here, we describe Gtag&T-seq, a genome-and-transcriptome sequencing (G&T-seq) protocol of the same single cells that omits whole-genome amplification (WGA) by using direct genomic tagmentation (Gtag). Gtag drastically decreases the cost and improves coverage uniformity at single-cell and pseudo-bulk levels compared to WGA-based G&T-seq. We also show that transcriptome-based DNA copy number inference has limited resolution and accuracy, underlining the importance of affordable multi-omic approaches. Applying Gtag&T-seq to a melanoma xenograft model before treatment and at minimal residual disease revealed differential cell state plasticity and treatment response between cancer subclones. In summary, Gtag&T-seq is a low-cost and accurate single-cell multi-omics method that explores genetic alterations and their functional consequences in single cells at scale.

Abstract: A protocol with tumor markers as guidelines to follow up colorectal cancer patients was designed using criteria other than those commonly reported. They included combination of several markers and their dynamic evaluation of three different levels of increase: isolated elevated value (IEV), constant level of elevation (CE), and progressive increase (PI). In a total of 90 patients, the levels of combined serum CEA-TPA and GICA were serially measured, and in 71 of them, CA 72.4 and CA 195 levels were also determined. The tumor markers were measured during the first few months after surgery, and the usefulness of combined CEA-TPA-GICA and other, possibly more favorable combinations was determined in relation to \"early\" detection of recurrence and development of metastases. In addition the usefulness of conventional radiologic examinations and the impact on patients survival following \"early\" diagnosis was evaluated. A positive correlation was found between elevated preoperative serum tumor marker levels and the stage of disease. The postoperative variation of high serum CEA values was useful in identifying micrometastases after primary tumor resection. In the \"early\" diagnosed 14 patients with recurrence during the postoperative follow-up period, the highest sensitivity was found for TPA (87%) and, of the marker combinations, TPA-GICA (93%) with a lead time of 4.6 +/- 5.6 and 5.4 +/- 7.8 months (mean +/- SD) respectively. In nonrelapsed patients, falsely positive results of TPA-GICA (25%) were fewer than those for TPA-CA 195 (31%) and TPA-GICA-CA72-4 (35%). However, TPA-CA 195 and TPA-GICA-CA72-4, based upon their high sensitivity in patients with metastases, seemed in keeping with the effectiveness of TPA-GICA for monitoring of postoperative patients with colorectal cancer. In patients who developed recurrences, PI was more frequently present than IEV. In patients without recurrence, the opposite occurred. CE had less frequently discriminatory capability between these two groups than IEV and PI. Routine radiographic studies were ineffective whereas liver echography with its high sensitivity revealed the first sign of recurrence. Eight (50%) of the 16 relapses (two patients relapsed twice) were suitable for surgery because only one organ with a single metastasis was involved. Three (75%) of the 4 patients with \"early\" diagnosis of recurrence are alive without evidence of disease 5, 18, and 20 months after the last surgery. The results of this study revealed the importance of \"early\" diagnosis of recurrence for improved survival of patients with colorectal cancer. Journal: Cancer detection and prevention. Year: 1995.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Hydrolyzed Rutin Decreases Worsening of Anaplasia in Glioblastoma Relapse.. Abstract: Gliomas are aggressive and resilient tumors. Progression to advanced stages of malignancy, characterized by cell anaplasia, necrosis, and reduced response to conventional surgery or therapeutic adjuvant, are critical challenges in glioma therapy. Relapse of the disease poses a considerable challenge for management. Hence, new compounds are required to improve therapeutic response. As hydrolyzed rutin (HR), a compound modified via rutin deglycosylation, as well as some flavonoids demonstrated antiproliferative effect for glioblastoma, these are considered potential epigenetic drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine the antitumor activity and evaluate the potential for modifying tumor aggressivity of rutin hydrolysates for treating both primary and relapsed glioblastoma. The glioblastoma cell line, U251, was used for analyzing cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis and for establishing the GBM mouse model. Mice with GBM were treated with HR to verify antitumor activity. Histological analysis was used to evaluate HR interference in aggressive behavior and glioma grade. Immunohistochemistry, comet assay, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) values were used to evaluate the mechanism of HR action. HR is an antiproliferative and antitumoral compound that inhibits the cell cycle via a p53- independent pathway. HR reduces tumor growth and aggression, mainly by decreasing mitosis and necrosis rates without genotoxicity, which is suggestive of epigenetic modulation. HR possesses antitumor activity and decreases anaplasia in glioblastoma, inhibiting progression to malignant stages of the disease. HR can improve the effectiveness of response to conventional therapy, which has a crucial role in recurrent glioma. Journal: CNS & neurological disorders drug targets. Year: 2019.

Abstract: Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy (19CAR-T) has achieved impressive clinical results in adult and pediatric relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the application and effect of CAR-T therapy in B-ALL patients with extramedullary relapse are rarely issued even disqualified in some clinical trials. Here, we examined the efficacy of 19CAR-T in patients with both bone marrow and extramedullary involvement. CAR-T cells were generated by transfection of primary human T lymphocytes with a lentiviral vector expressing anti-CD19 single chain antibody fragments (scFvs) with the cytoplasmic domains of 4-1BB and CD3\u03b6, and used to infuse patients diagnosed as having r/r B-ALL with extramedullary origination. Clinical responses were evaluated by the use of bone marrow aspiration, imaging, and flow cytometry. Eight patients received 19CAR-T infusion and all attained complete remission (CR). Only one patient was bridged to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although three patients relapsed after infusion, they received 19/22CAR-T infusion sequentially and attained a second remission. To date, five patients are in continuous CR and all eight patients are still alive. The mean follow-up time was 21.9 months, while the 24-month estimated event-free survival is 51.4%. 19CAR-T therapy can lead to clinical remission for extramedullary relapsed pediatric B-ALL patients. However, the problem of CD19+ relapses after CAR-T remained to be solved. For patients relapsing after CAR-T, a second CAR-T therapy creates another opportunity for remission for subsequent HSCT.

Abstract: Our goal is to leverage publicly available whole transcriptome and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen data to identify and prioritize novel breast cancer therapeutic targets. We used DepMap dependency scores\u2009>\u20090.5 to identify genes that are potential therapeutic targets in 48 breast cancer cell lines. We removed genes that were pan-essential or were not expressed in TCGA breast cancer cohort. Genes were prioritized based on druggability using the Drug-Gene Interaction Database. Targets were defined separately for ER+, HER2+, and TNBC. A broader list of genes with dependency score\u2009>\u20090.25 were used to assess the associations between dependency scores and mutations and copy number variations (CNV) to identify potential synthetic lethal relationships and to map survival critical genes into biological pathways. 66, 53, and 29 genes were prioritized as targets in ER+, HER2+, and TNBC, respectively. These included known actionable targets and many novel targets. ER+ included FOXA1, GATA3, LDB1, TRPS1, NAMPT, WDR26, and ZNF217; HER2+ cancers included STX4, HECTD1, and TBL1XR1; and TNBC included GFPT1 and GPX4. Synthetic lethal associations revealed 5 and 19 significant associations between potential survival critical genes and mutations in HER2+\u2009and TNBC, respectively. For example, PIK3CA mutation increased dependency on NDUFS3 in HER2+\u2009cancers, and CNTRL mutation increased dependency on electron transport chain (ETC) genes in TNBC. 329, 747, and 622 CNVs showed synthetic lethal association in ER+, HER2+, and TNBC, respectively.

Abstract: Diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered (DMG) are highly aggressive malignancies of the central nervous system (CNS) that primarily affect the pediatric population. Large scale spatial transcriptomic studies have implicated that tumor microenvironmental landscape plays an important role in determining the phenotypic differences in tumor presentation and clinical course, however, data connecting overall transcriptomic changes to the protein level is lacking. The NanoString GeoMx<sup>\u2122</sup>\u00a0Digital Spatial Profiler platform was used to determine the spatial transcriptomic and proteomic landscape in a cohort of both pediatric and adult H3 K27-altered DMG biopsy samples. Three fluorescently labeled antibodies targeting immune cells (CD45), epithelial cells (PanCK), tumor cells (H3 K27M) and a nucleic acid stain (SYTO-13) were used to establish regions of interest (ROI) for genomic and proteomic analysis. We found genetic alterations within the tumor which can be delineated across patient age and spatial location. We show that the H3 K27M mutation itself has a profound impact on tumor cells transcriptomics and interestingly we found limited fidelity between overall transcriptome and proteome. Our data also validate a previously described genomic signature at the proteomic level and reveal a special shift in the signature based on the local TME composition. Journal: Scientific reports.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Advances for studying clonal evolution in cancer.. Abstract: The \"clonal evolution\" model of cancer emerged and \"evolved\" amid ongoing advances in technology, especially in recent years during which next generation sequencing instruments have provided ever higher resolution pictures of the genetic changes in cancer cells and heterogeneity in tumors. It has become increasingly clear that clonal evolution is not a single sequential process, but instead frequently involves simultaneous evolution of multiple subclones that co-exist because they are of similar fitness or are spatially separated. Co-evolution of subclones also occurs when they complement each other's survival advantages. Recent studies have also shown that clonal evolution is highly heterogeneous: different individual tumors of the same type may undergo very different paths of clonal evolution. New methodological advancements, including deep digital sequencing of a mixed tumor population, single cell sequencing, and the development of more sophisticated computational tools, will continue to shape and reshape the models of clonal evolution. In turn, these will provide both an improved framework for the understanding of cancer progression and a guide for treatment strategies aimed at the elimination of all, rather than just some, of the cancer cells within a patient.

This evolution in clinical practice provides a lens through which to review the lessons learned from drug development in oncogene-addicted lung cancers, guided by translational insights into tumor biology and mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. For oncogenic drivers that are less sensitive to single-agent targeted therapies, rationally designed combination strategies will be needed to enable first-line use of targeted agents.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Analysis of Paired Primary-Metastatic Hormone-Receptor Positive Breast Tumors (HRPBC) Uncovers Potential Novel Drivers of Hormonal Resistance.. Abstract: We sought to identify genetic variants associated with disease relapse and failure to hormonal treatment in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (HRPBC). We analyzed a series of HRPBC with distant relapse, by sequencing pairs (n = 11) of tumors (primary and metastases) at >800X. Comparative genomic hybridization was performed as well. Top hits, based on the frequency of alteration and severity of the changes, were tested in the TCGA series. Genes determining the most parsimonious prognostic signature were studied for their functional role in vitro, by performing cell growth assays in hormonal-deprivation conditions, a setting that mimics treatment with aromatase inhibitors. Severe alterations were recurrently found in 18 genes in the pairs. However, only MYC, DNAH5, CSFR1, EPHA7, ARID1B, and KMT2C preserved an independent prognosis impact and/or showed a significantly different incidence of alterations between relapsed and non-relapsed cases in the TCGA series. The signature composed of MYC, KMT2C, and EPHA7 best discriminated the clinical course, (overall survival 90,7 vs. 144,5 months; p = 0.0001). Having an alteration in any of the genes of the signature implied a hazard ratio of death of 3.25 (p<0.0001), and early relapse during the adjuvant hormonal treatment. The presence of the D348N mutation in KMT2C and/or the T666I mutation in the kinase domain of EPHA7 conferred hormonal resistance in vitro. Novel inactivating mutations in KMT2C and EPHA7, which confer hormonal resistance, are linked to adverse clinical course in HRPBC. Journal: PloS one. Year: 2016.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Efficacy of tumour-treating fields therapy in recurrent glioblastoma: A narrative review of current evidence.. Abstract: Recurrent Glioblastoma presents a formidable challenge in oncology due to its aggressive nature and limited treatment options. Tumour-Treating Fields (TTFields) Therapy, a novel therapeutic modality, has emerged as a promising approach to address this clinical conundrum. This review synthesizes the current evidence surrounding the efficacy of TTFields Therapy in the context of recurrent Glioblastoma. Diverse academic databases were explored to identify relevant studies published within the last decade. Strategic keyword selection facilitated the inclusion of studies focusing on TTFields Therapy's efficacy, treatment outcomes, and patient-specific factors. The review reveals a growing body of evidence suggesting the potential clinical benefits of TTFields Therapy for patients with recurrent Glioblastoma. Studies consistently demonstrate its positive impact on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The therapy's safety profile remains favorable, with mild to moderate skin reactions being the most commonly reported adverse events. Our analysis highlights the importance of patient selection criteria, with emerging biomarkers such as PTEN mutation status influencing therapy response. Additionally, investigations into combining TTFields Therapy with other treatments, including surgical interventions and novel approaches, offer promising avenues for enhancing therapeutic outcomes. The synthesis of diverse studies underscores the potential of TTFields Therapy as a valuable addition to the armamentarium against recurrent Glioblastoma. The narrative review comprehensively explains the therapy's mechanisms, clinical benefits, adverse events, and future directions. The insights gathered herein serve as a foundation for clinicians and researchers striving to optimize treatment strategies for patients facing the challenging landscape of recurrent Glioblastoma.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: <i>Kras</i> mutant genetically engineered mouse models of human cancers are genomically heterogeneous.. Abstract: <i>KRAS</i> mutant tumors are largely recalcitrant to targeted therapies. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of <i>Kras</i> mutant cancer recapitulate critical aspects of this disease and are widely used for preclinical validation of targets and therapies. Through comprehensive profiling of exomes and matched transcriptomes of >200 <i>Kras</i>G12D-initiated GEMM tumors from one lung and two pancreatic cancer models, we discover that significant intratumoral and intertumoral genomic heterogeneity evolves during tumorigenesis. Known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, beyond those engineered, are mutated, amplified, and deleted. Unlike human tumors, the GEMM genomic landscapes are dominated by copy number alterations, while protein-altering mutations are rare. However, interspecies comparative analyses of the genomic landscapes demonstrate fidelity between genes altered in <i>KRAS</i> mutant human and murine tumors. Genes that are spontaneously altered during murine tumorigenesis are also among the most prevalent found in human indications. Using targeted therapies, we also demonstrate that this inherent tumor heterogeneity can be exploited preclinically to discover cancer-specific and genotype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Focusing on <i>Kras</i> allelic imbalance, a feature shared by all three models, we discover that MAPK pathway inhibition impinges uniquely on this event, indicating distinct susceptibility and fitness advantage of <i>Kras</i>-mutant cells. These data reveal previously unknown genomic diversity among <i>KrasG12D</i>-initiated GEMM tumors, places them in context of human patients, and demonstrates how to exploit this inherent tumor heterogeneity to discover therapeutic vulnerabilities.

Having reference to preceding reports provided by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an estimated 9.6 million deaths transpired from cancer worldwide in 2018. Similarly, about 18.1 million new cases of cancer are being reported. The rise in conventional treatments akin to surgeries, chemotherapies, and radiotherapies was enormously observed to eradicate cancer tumors. These studies have shown unfavorable side effects in clinical treatments. Drug resistivity and drug cytotoxicities are also major issues to overcome. Considering these, researchers are developing alternative methods that are robust, economical, and safe. The use of light for therapeutic purposes shows a great history in vitiligo treatment. The combination of an effective activating agent and phototherapy could result as the best alternative with a great outcome to minimize adverse effects on healthy tissues. The utilization of light in the deletion of tumors using photothermal agents, and photosensitizers, hence the phototherapies in oncology were discovered and rapidly involved in the advancement of clinical approach. Here, in this article, we tried to highlight the recent trends in phototherapy and reviewed different types of phototherapy methods in cancer treatments and their latest clinical, preclinical, and in vivo studies.

Abstract: Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE) is a devastating condition that relapses, often with a chorea in children, despite adequate antiviral treatment. At relapse, evidence of viral replication is frequently absent, suggesting that the relapse may be immune-mediated. Seven children who had a neurological relapse following their initial encephalitis, identified from 20 cases of pediatric HSVE, were studied. Serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were tested for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and other antibodies previously reported in central nervous system autoimmunity. Five of the 7 relapsing children had choreoathetosis; 2 of these were NMDAR antibody-positive, 2 were negative (1 with HSV-positive CSF), and 1 was not available for testing. An additional patient, who relapsed with cognitive regression but with no movement disorder, was also NMDAR antibody-positive. In 2 of the NMDAR antibody-positive patients who were treated at relapse and in 1 who was treated only after 10 years of having a relapsing encephalopathy, a beneficial response was observed. Neurological relapses after HSVE may frequently be immune-mediated, particularly in children with chorea. NMDAR antibodies are common, and immunotherapy may be beneficial.

Abstract: Genome-wide transcriptome analyses have given systems-level insights into gene regulatory networks. Due to the limited depth of quantitative proteomics, however, our understanding of post-transcriptional gene regulation and its effects on protein-complex stoichiometry are lagging behind. Here, we employ deep sequencing and the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technology to determine transcript and protein expression changes of a Drosophila brain tumor model at near genome-wide resolution. In total, we quantify more than 6,200 tissue-specific proteins, corresponding to about 70% of all transcribed protein-coding genes. Using our integrated data set, we demonstrate that post-transcriptional gene regulation varies considerably with biological function and is surprisingly high for genes regulating transcription. We combine our quantitative data with protein-protein interaction data and show that post-transcriptional mechanisms significantly enhance co-regulation of protein-complex subunits beyond transcriptional co-regulation. Interestingly, our results suggest that only about 11% of the annotated Drosophila protein complexes are co-regulated in the brain. Finally, we refine the composition of some of these core protein complexes by analyzing the co-regulation of potential subunits. Our comprehensive transcriptome and proteome data provide a valuable resource for quantitative biology and offer novel insights into understanding post-transcriptional gene regulation in a tumor model.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: New insights into the metastatic behavior after breast cancer surgery, according to well-established clinicopathological variables and molecular subtypes.. Abstract: Despite advances in treatment, up to 30% of patients with early breast cancer (BC) experience distant disease relapse. However, a comprehensive understanding of tumor spread and site-specific recurrence patterns remains lacking. This retrospective case-control study included 103 consecutive patients with metastatic BC admitted to our institution (2000-2013). Cases were matched according to age, tumor biology, and clinicopathological features to 221 patients with non-metastatic BC (control group). The median follow-up period among the 324 eligible patients was 7.3 years. While relatively low values for sensitivity (71%) and specificity (56%) were found for axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement as an indicator of risk and pattern of distant relapse, nodal status remained the most powerful predictor of metastases (OR: 3.294; CL: 1.9-5.5). Rates of dissemination and metastatic efficiency differed according to molecular subtype. HER2-positive subtypes showed a stronger association with systemic spread (OR: 2.127; CL: 1.2-3.8) than other subgroups. Classification as Luminal or Non-Luminal showed an increased risk of lung and distant nodal recurrence, and a decreased risk in bone metastases in the Non-Luminal group (OR: 2.9, 3.345, and 0.2, respectively). Tumors with HER2 overexpression had a significantly high risk for distant relapse (OR: 2.127) compared with HER2-negative tumors and also showed higher central nervous system (CNS) and lung metastatic potential (OR: 5.6 and 2.65, respectively) and low risk of bone disease progression (OR: 0.294). Furthermore, we found significant associations between biological profiles and sites of recurrence. A new process of clinical/diagnostic staging, including molecular subtypes, could better predict the likelihood of distant relapses and their anatomical location. Recognition and appreciation of clinically distinct molecular subtypes may assist in evaluation of the probability of distant relapses and their sites. Our analysis provides new insights into management of metastatic disease behavior, to lead to an optimal disease-tailored approach and appropriate follow-up. Journal: PloS one. Year: 2017.

Abstract: In relation to recent advances in nanobiotechnologies, cancer-targeted therapy using nano-scaled drug carriers (nanocarriers) has been attracting enormous attention with success in clinical studies. Polymeric micelles, core-shell-type nanoparticles formed through the self-assembly of block copolymers, are one of the most promising nanocarrier, because their critical features such as size, stability, and drug incorporation efficiency and release rate can be modulated by designing the constituent block copolymers. The utilities of polymeric micelles have been reported not only in experimental tumor models in mice but also in clinical studies. In this article, we aim to explain the rationale of designing polymeric micelles for targeting intractable cancers such as pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, and metastases. Also, we review recent progress in clinical studies on polymeric micelles incorporating anticancer drugs. In addition, we introduce the next generation of polymeric micelles as the platform integrated with smart functionalities such as targetability, environmental sensitivity, and imaging properties. Thus, polymeric micelles can realize safe and effective cancer therapy, and offer tailor-made medicines for individual patients. Journal: Cancer science. Year: 2016.

Abstract: Although initial treatment of Hodgkin's disease induces a complete remission in most patients, approximately 50% of patients with advanced disease will not achieve a complete remission or will relapse following the first complete remission. Twenty-three patients with relapsed/resistant Hodgkin's disease, observed between January 1991 and October 1993, underwent CEP combination chemotherapy (CCNU, etoposide, prednimustine). All patients had previously received MOPP and ABVD regimens, in combination at diagnosis or sequentially (at diagnosis and at the first relapse). Thirteen (56%) patients achieved complete responses and 4 (18%) had partial responses. Two partial responders obtained a complete remission after a successive autologous bone marrow transplantation. The complete remission was not influenced by the timing of MOPP and ABVD treatments, presence of extranodal involvement or presence of bulky disease, but was affected by the presence of a primary disease refractory to the first standard programs. All the complete responders but 2 were alive and relapse-free at a median follow-up of 15 months; no major toxic effects were recorded. These data suggest, as did those of other studies, that CEP is an effective regimen in patients with Hodgkin's disease in first or second relapse, also to reduce the tumor burden and to determine chemosensitivity before contingent bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell support.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: SUMO: From Bench to Bedside.. Abstract: Sentrin/small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is protein modification pathway that regulates multiple biological processes, including cell division, DNA replication/repair, signal transduction, and cellular metabolism. In this review, we will focus on recent advances in the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, such as cancer, diabetes, seizure, and heart failure, which have been linked to the SUMO pathway. SUMO is conjugated to lysine residues in target proteins through an isopeptide linkage catalyzed by SUMO-specific activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligating (E3) enzymes. In steady state, the quantity of SUMO-modified substrates is usually a small fraction of unmodified substrates due to the deconjugation activity of the family Sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs). In contrast to the complexity of the ubiquitination/deubiquitination machinery, the biochemistry of SUMOylation and de-SUMOylation is relatively modest. Specificity of the SUMO pathway is achieved through redox regulation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or other posttranslational protein modification of the SUMOylation and de-SUMOylation enzymes. There are three major SUMOs. SUMO-1 usually modifies a substrate as a monomer; however, SUMO-2/3 can form poly-SUMO chains. The monomeric SUMO-1 or poly-SUMO chains can interact with other proteins through SUMO-interactive motif (SIM). Thus SUMO modification provides a platform to enhance protein-protein interaction. The consequence of SUMOylation includes changes in cellular localization, protein activity, or protein stability. Furthermore, SUMO may join force with ubiquitin to degrade proteins through SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbL). After 20 yr of research, SUMO has been shown to play critical roles in most, if not all, biological pathways. Thus the SUMO enzymes could be targets for drug development to treat human diseases.

Abstract: Bacteria-based therapy has emerged as a promising strategy for cancer treatment, offering the potential for targeted tumor delivery, immune activation, and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. However, the unpredictable behavior, safety concerns, and limited efficacy of wild-type bacteria pose significant challenges to their clinical translation. Recent advancements in synthetic biology and chemical engineering have enabled the development of precisely engineered bacterial platforms with enhanced controllability, targeted delivery, and reduced toxicity. This review summarize the current progress of engineered bacteria in cancer therapy. We first introduce the theoretical underpinnings and key advantages of bacterial therapies in cancer. Subsequently, we delve into the applications of genetic engineering and chemical modification techniques to enhance their therapeutic potential. Finally, we address critical challenges and future prospects, with a focus on improving safety and efficacy. This review aims to stimulate further research and provide valuable insights into the development of engineered bacterial therapies for precision oncology. Journal: Biomaterials. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The VEGF pathway in lung cancer.. Abstract: Lung cancer is a disease whose prognosis has remained poor in the last decades. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular pathways behind this disease have revealed several mediators of important tumor functions. One of these functions is angiogenesis, which is considered essential for tumor growth and propagation, and a key mediator promoting this process is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In lung cancer, VEGF plays a significant role in establishing a vascular supply within the tumor. Thus, a new class of drugs has emerged, targeting its pathway, which has offered substantial, albeit small, improvements in patient prognosis. The VEGF pathway and its role in a multitude of different human cancers are presented at first. We then proceed by analyzing its importance in lung cancer and exploring the therapeutic benefits achieved by its targeting, which set new goals for the future. Today, the VEGF pathway remains an attractive target for anticancer treatment, and the way forward requires detection of predictive markers and efforts for a more complete angiogenic blockade.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Tumor Cell Communications as Promising Supramolecular Targets for Cancer Chemotherapy: A Possible Strategy.. Abstract: Fifty-two years have passed since President Nixon launched the \"War on Cancer\". Despite unparalleled efforts and funds allocated worldwide, the outlined goals were not achieved because cancer treatment approaches such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal and targeted therapies have not fully met the expectations. Based on the recent literature, a new direction in cancer therapy can be proposed which targets connections between cancer cells and their microenvironment by chemical means. Cancer-stromal synapses such as immunological synapses between cancer and immune cells provide an attractive target for this approach. Such synapses form ligand-receptor clusters on the interface of the interacting cells. They share a common property of involving intercellular clusters of spatially proximate and cooperatively acting proteins. Synapses provide the space for the focused intercellular signaling molecules exchange. Thus, the disassembly of cancer-stromal synapses may potentially cause the collapse of various tumors. Additionally, the clustered arrangement of synapse components offers opportunities to enhance treatment safety and precision by using targeted crosslinking chemical agents which may inactivate cancer synapses even in reduced concentrations. Furthermore, attaching a cleavable cell-permeable toxic agent(s) to a crosslinker may further enhance the anti-cancer effect of such therapeutics. The highlighted approach promises to be universal, relatively simple and cost-efficient. We also hope that, unlike chemotherapeutic and immune drugs that interact with a single target, by using supramolecular large clusters that include many different components as a target, the emergence of a resistance characteristic of chemo- and immunotherapy is extremely unlikely.

Abstract: The discovery of new biomarkers is a rapidly advancing area in cancer biology. The challenge of biomarker development for broad clinical use requires the translation of lab-based knowledge into clinical practice. The Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements-1 (LINE-1s or L1 elements) are active members of an autonomous family of non-LTR retrotransposons and occupy nearly 17% of the human genome. There is strong experimental evidence that the global hypomethylation of genomic DNA in cancer cells results in the activation of L1s and their expression is detectable at genome, transcriptome and proteome levels in human cancer cells. Thus, human L1s constitute a potential marker for cancer cells. In this review we have attempted to scrutinize L1 expression profiles in clinical cancer studies by undertaking a comprehensive systematic analysis of papers published in the field so far with a view to providing a more complete picture of the detection methods used, improvements achieved and potential future directions. Ultimately, we will try to evaluate the potential of L1s as a molecular marker in cancer detection. Journal: Current molecular medicine. Year: 2011.

Abstract: Aptamers are a class of folded nucleic acid strands capable of binding to different target molecules with high affinity and selectivity. Over the years, they have gained a substantial amount of interest as promising molecular tools for numerous medical applications, particularly in targeted therapeutics. However, only the different treatment approaches and current developments of aptamer-drug therapies have been discussed so far, ignoring the crucial technical and functional aspects of constructing a therapeutically effective aptamer-driven drug delivery system that translates to improved in-vivo performance. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the strategies used to improve the therapeutic performance of aptamer-guided delivery systems. We focus on the different functional features such as drug deployment, payload capacity, in-vivo stability and targeting efficiency to further our knowledge in enhancing the cell-specific delivery of aptamer-drug conjugates. Each reported strategy is critically discussed to emphasize both the benefits provided in comparison with other similar techniques and to outline their potential drawbacks with respect to the molecular properties of the aptamers, the drug and the system to be designed. The molecular architecture and design considerations for an efficient aptamer-based delivery system are also briefly elaborated.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Pan-cancer analysis of heterogeneity of tumor mutational burden and genomic mutation under treatment pressure.. Abstract: High tumor mutational burden (TMB) is one of the widely researched predictive biomarkers of immune checkpoint inhibitors and has been shown to be closely related with response to immunotherapy in multiple cancer types. However, for patients who have failed conventional therapy and are about to undergo immunotherapy, there is no consensus recommendation on the timing of tumor sampling for TMB analysis, and the effects of different therapies on TMB have not been clarified. This retrospective observational study aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of TMB and genomic mutation under the treatment pressure. We retrospectively collected the available genomic and therapeutic information from 8051 samples across 15 tumor types (>50 samples/tumor) found in 30 published studies and investigated the distribution and heterogeneity of TMB under treatment across diverse cohorts. This integrated analysis has shown anticancer treatments increased TMB. Significant effects of treatment on TMB were more frequently observed in tumor types with lower treatment-na\u00efve TMB, including breast, prostate, and pediatric cancers. For different cancer therapies, chemotherapy was prone to be correlated with an increased TMB in most cancer types. Meanwhile, the fraction of the TMB-high category of breast, prostate, and bladder cancers and glioma increased significantly after chemotherapy. Several actionable genes including ERS1 and NF1 in breast cancer, as well as some prognostic markers including TERT in bladder cancer and IDH1 in glioma, were significantly changed in post-chemotherapy tumors compared to treatment-na\u00efve tumors. Our study reveals the heterogeneity of TMB under treatment across diverse cancer types and provides evidences that chemotherapy was associated with increases in TMB as well as the fraction of TMB-high category, suggesting that resampling tumor tissues for calculating post-chemotherapy TMB could be a better option for predicting the response to immunotherapy, especially for tumors with initially low TMB.

Abstract: PURPOSE To investigate whether hormonal receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) change throughout tumor progression, because this may alter patient management. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study cohort included female patients with breast cancer in the Stockholm health care region who relapsed from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2007. Either biochemical or immunohistochemical (IHC)/immunocytochemical (ICC) methods were used to determine estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status, which was then confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization for IHC/ICC 2+ and 3+ status. Results ER (459 patients), PR (430 patients), and HER2 (104 patients) from both primary tumor and relapse were assessed, revealing a change in 32.4% (McNemar's test P < .001), 40.7% (P < .001), and 14.5% (P = .44) of patients, respectively. Assessment of ER (119 patients), PR (116 patients), and HER2 (32 patients) with multiple (from two to six) consecutive relapses showed an alteration in 33.6%, 32.0%, and 15.7% of patients, respectively. A statistically significant differential overall survival related to intraindividual ER and PR status in primary tumor and relapse (log-rank P < .001) was noted. In addition, women with ER-positive primary tumors that changed to ER-negative tumors had a significant 48% increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.05) compared with women with stable ER-positive tumors. CONCLUSION Patients with breast cancer experience altered hormone receptor and HER2 status throughout tumor progression, possibly influenced by adjuvant therapies, which significantly influences survival. Hence, marker investigations at relapse may potentially improve patient management and survival. Journal: Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Abstract: Solute Carrier (SLC) transporters are a large superfamily of transmembrane carriers involved in the regulated transport of metabolites, nutrients, ions and drugs across cellular membranes. A subset of these solute carriers play a significant role in the cellular uptake of many cancer therapeutics, ranging from chemotherapeutics such as antimetabolites, topoisomerase inhibitors, platinum-based drugs and taxanes to targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. SLC transporters are co-expressed in groups and patterns across normal tissues, suggesting they may comprise a coordinated regulatory circuit serving to mediate normal tissue functions. In cancer however, there are dramatic changes in expression patterns of SLC transporters. This frequently serves to feed the increased metabolic demands of the tumor cell for amino acids, nucleotides and other metabolites, but also presents a therapeutic opportunity, as increased transporter expression may serve to increase intracellular concentrations of substrate drugs. In this review, we examine the regulation of drug transporters in cancer and how this impacts therapy response, and discuss novel approaches to targeting therapies to specific cancers via tumor-specific aberrations in transporter expression. We propose that among the oncogenic changes in SLC transporter expression there exist emergent vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically, extending the application of precision medicine from tumor-specific drug targets to tumor-specific determinants of drug uptake.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The genomic landscape of carcinomas with mucinous differentiation.. Abstract: Mucinous carcinomas can arise in any organ with epithelial cells that produce mucus. While mucinous tumors from different organs are histologically similar, it remains to be elucidated whether they share molecular alterations. Here we analyzed a total of 902 patients across six cancer types by comparing mucinous and non-mucinous samples, integrating text mining of pathology reports, gene expression, methylation, mutational and copy-number profiling. We found that, in addition to genes involved in mucin processing and secretion, MUC2 up-regulation is a multi-cancer biomarker of mucinous histology and is regulated by DNA methylation in colorectal, breast and stomach cancer. The majority of carcinomas with mucinous differentiation had fewer DNA copy-number alterations than non-mucinous tumors. The tumor mutational burden was lower in breast and lung with mucinous differentiation compared to their non-mucinous counterparts. We found several differences in the frequency of oncogenic gene and pathway alterations between mucinous and non-mucinous carcinomas, including a lower frequency of p53 pathway alterations in colorectal and lung cancer, and a lower frequency of PI-3-Kinase/Akt pathway alterations in breast and stomach cancer with mucinous differentiation. This study shows that carcinomas with mucinous differentiation originating from different organs share transcriptomic and genomic similarities. These results might pave the way for a more biologically relevant taxonomy for these rare cancers. Journal: Scientific reports. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Bacteriophage-eukaryotic cell interaction provides the biological foundation of Phage Display technology, which has been widely adopted in studies involving protein-protein and protein-peptide interactions, and it provides a direct link between the proteins and the DNA encoding them. Phage display has also facilitated the development of new therapeutic agents targeting personalized cancer mutations. Proteins encoded by mutant genes in cancers can be processed and presented on the tumor cell surface by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, and such mutant peptides are called Neoantigens. Neoantigens are naturally existing tumor markers presented on the cell surface. In clinical settings, the T-cell recognition of neoantigens is the foundation of cancer immunotherapeutics. This year, we utilized phage display to successfully develop the 1st antibody-based neoantigen targeting approach for next-generation personalized cancer therapeutics. In this article, we discussed the strategies for identifying neoantigens, followed by using phage display to create personalized cancer therapeutics-a complete pipeline for personalized cancer treatment.

Abstract: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is among the most abundant mRNA modifications in eukaryote. The aim of the present study was to investigate function of m6A mRNA methylation in lung cancer and the underlying mechanism. Microarray analysis was performed to detect the differences in RNA expression between cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples. The target mRNAs were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. Hierarchical clustering of RNAs was conducted to identify distinct m6A methylation or expression patterns between the samples. In the present study, some differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of mRNAs were identified, including up-regulated secret phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and down-regulated pRB. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that while differential hypermethylation was related to cell cycle, intracellular part and protein binding, the main pathway involved herpes simplex virus 1 infection related to down-regulated AKT, Araf1 and BCL2A1. In the meantime, sexual reproduction, cohesin complex and protein C-terminus binding was functionally linked to differential hypomethylation, while fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis were identified as the main pathways related to up-regulated GST and CNP. We showed that lung cancer development involved differential expression of SPP1 and pRB mRNA, as well as m6A mRNA methylation in AKT, APAF1, BCL2A1, GST and CNP genes. Journal: Bioscience reports.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Drug Combinatorial Therapies for the Treatment of KRAS Mutated Lung Cancers.. Abstract: KRAS is the most common oncogene to be mutated in lung cancer, and therapeutics directly targeting KRAS have proven to be challenging. The mutations of KRAS are associated with poor prognosis, and resistance to both adjuvant therapy and targeted EGFR TKI. EGFR TKIs provide significant clinical benefit for patients whose tumors bear EGFR mutations. However, tumors with KRAS mutations rarely respond to the EGFR TKI therapy. Thus, combination therapy is essential for the treatment of lung cancers with KRAS mutations. EGFR TKI combined with inhibitors of MAPKs, PI3K/mTOR, HDAC, Wee1, PARP, CDK and Hsp90, even miRNAs and immunotherapy, were reviewed. Although the effects of the combination vary, the combined therapeutics are one of the best options at present to treat KRAS mutant lung cancer. Journal: Current topics in medicinal chemistry.

Abstract: Our focus was on patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who experienced relapse or died without becoming transplantation candidates. The purpose was to outline measures needed to improve the outcome. We analyzed our population-based 20-year data on 3,385 Nordic children with ALL treated on Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ALL protocols, and described the flow of these patients through relapses, remissions, and deaths as a result of toxicity, demonstrating where major patient losses occurred. In total, 854 patients (25%) had a first and 274 patients (8%) had a second ALL relapse. P for survival after the first relapse was .35 +/- .02. The induction mortality (2.2%, primary; 10.3%, first relapse; 26.3%, second relapse) and remission mortality (1%, first complete remission [1CR]; 19%, second CR [2CR]) were significant; transplantation-related mortality (TRM) only represented 15% (69 of 459) of the deaths as a result of toxicity. Of the 766 patients entering 2CR, 29% underwent transplantation (P for survival, .46 +/- .04), whereas 71% continued receiving chemotherapy (P for survival, .39 +/- .02). Children with stem-cell transplantation indications in 2CR, if they did not undergo transplantation, generally died or had a second relapse. The patient groups that underwent transplantation in 1CR (n = 84), 2CR (n = 220), and > or = 3CR (n = 62) represented different risk profiles. Those with allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in > or = 3CR (P for survival, .37 +/- .07) had an ALL and first relapse with favorable features. Major patient losses occurred through mortality as a result of toxicity and resistant disease during the pathways before allo-SCT. After relapse, more patients were lost to mortality as a result of toxicity during conventional chemotherapy compared with TRM. After second relapse, the chance for rescue by allo-SCT in 3CR was minimal. The question of whether transplantation is recommended after ALL relapse should be carefully addressed, and more efficient relapse protocols should be launched.

Abstract: Cancer therapy has been revolutionised by the emergence of RNA-based therapeutics, providing several strategies and mechanisms to regulate gene expression via messenger RNA (mRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNAs (miRNA), antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), and RNA aptamers. The present review highlights the recent advances in the preclinical development and clinical applications of RNA-based therapeutics, focusing on the delivery strategies, biological targets, and pharmacological optimisation, together with key clinical data. mRNA therapeutics, especially those adapted from vaccine platforms are being developed for the cancer immunotherapy and protein replacement, while siRNAs and ASOs enable highly specific gene silencing and splice correction. miRNA therapies show potential for diverse oncogenic pathway control, despite ongoing challenges in the delivery and specificity. RNA aptamers are obtaining attention as tumor-targeting agents in the drug delivery systems. Progress in lipid nanoparticles, chemical modifications, and tissue-specific delivery has improved the stability and efficacy of these agents. Early-phase clinical trials report encouraging outcomes in both solid tumours and haematologic malignancies, particularly in overcoming resistance and modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME). Although challenges remain in scalability, immune activation, and deep-tumour penetration, RNA-based strategies are advancing towards integration into clinical oncology. Continued refinement of delivery technologies and targeted trial designs will be critical for translating these therapies into effective, personalized cancer treatments. Journal: Molecular cancer.

Abstract: Tumors are complex ecosystems in which heterogeneous cancer cells interact with their microenvironment composed of diverse immune, endothelial, and stromal cells. Cancer biology had been studied using bulk genomic and gene expression profiling, which however mask the cellular diversity and average the variability among individual molecular programs. Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomic sequencing have enabled a detailed dissection of tumor ecosystems and promoted our understanding of tumorigenesis at single-cell resolution. In the present review, we discuss the main topics of recent cancer studies that have implemented single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). To study cancer cells, scRNA-seq has provided novel insights into the cancer stem-cell model, treatment resistance, and cancer metastasis. To study the tumor microenvironment, scRNA-seq has portrayed the diverse cell types and complex cellular states of both immune and non-immune cells interacting with cancer cells, with the promise to discover novel targets for future immunotherapy.

Abstract: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy with extremely high mortality due to the appearance of widespread metastases early in its clinical course and rapid acquisition of chemoresistance after initial therapy. A theory of cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance is thought to be a principal mechanism in which extracellular matrix proteins provide a survival advantage against cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis. We found that the tetraspanin family member CD9 was expressed preferentially in SCLC tumors and metastases from three of seven relapsed patients, whereas chemona\u00efve primary tumors from 16 patients were CD9 negative with only one exception. Additionally, CD9 was highly expressed on SCLC cell lines rendered resistant to cisplatin or etoposide, and was upregulated in parental chemosensitive cells within 48 hours after exposure to either of these compounds. CD9-expressing chemoresistant SCLC cells adhered more tightly to fibronectin via \u03b21 integrin, but they were less motile than the respective chemosensitive parental lines. Notably, treatment of the chemoresistant cells with chemokine CXCL12 downregulated CD9 and transiently restored motility. Moreover, selective targeting of CD9 by treatment with specific monoclonal antibody ALB6 or a small interfering RNA triggered apoptosis in the chemoresistant cells. Taken together, our findings implicate CD9 in the cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance mechanism, highlighting CD9 as an attractive therapeutic target to improve therapeutic outcomes in SCLC.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Polyester nanomedicines targeting inflammatory signaling pathways for cancer therapy.. Abstract: The growth of cancerous cells and their responses towards substantial therapeutics are primarily controlled by inflammations (acute and chronic) and inflammation-associated products, which either endorse or repress tumor progression. Additionally, major signaling pathways, including NF-\u03baB, STAT3, inflammation-causing factors (cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, chemokines), and growth-regulating factors (VEGF, TGF-\u03b2), are vital regulators responsible for the instigation and resolution of inflammations. Moreover, the conventional chemotherapeutics have exhibited diverse limitations, including poor pharmacokinetics, unfavorable chemical properties, poor targetability to the disease-specific disease leading to toxicity; thus, their applications are restricted in inflammation-mediated cancer therapy. Furthermore, nanotechnology has demonstrated potential benefits over conventional chemotherapeutics, such as it protected the incorporated drug/bioactive moiety from enzymatic degradation within the systemic circulation, improving the physicochemical properties of poorly aqueous soluble chemotherapeutic agents, and enhancing their targetability in specified carcinogenic cells rather than accumulating in the healthy cells, leading reduced cytotoxicity. Among diverse nanomaterials, polyester-based nanoparticulate delivery systems have been extensively used to target various inflammation-mediated cancers. This review summarizes the therapeutic potentials of various polyester nanomaterials (PLGA, PCL, PLA, PHA, and others)-based delivery systems targeting multiple signaling pathways related to inflammation-mediated cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Two Distinct Tumorigenic Processes in Endometrial Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma.. Abstract: Endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEA) is conventionally considered to be a single pathologic entity that develops through a hyperplasia-carcinoma sequence under the influence of estrogen. Previously, another EEA subtype was described and proposed to arise directly from normal endometrium. These conventional and de novo subtypes are designated groups 1 and 2, respectively. To identify the molecular mechanisms of these distinct tumorigenic processes, we conducted comprehensive integrated analyses of genomic data with hormonal status for group 1 paired carcinoma and hyperplasia and group 2 carcinoma samples. Although group 1 carcinomas mostly exhibited genomically stable characteristics and the activation of estrogen signaling, group 2 EEAs showed enriched hypermutator and CpG island methylator phenotypes. Pairwise comparisons of hyperplasia and carcinoma, along with time-course analyses of the hyperplasia-carcinoma sequence, revealed the acquisition of driver mutations in the evolutionary process of hyperplasia but not in the transition from hyperplasia to carcinoma. The current study confirms the existence of two different histopathologic programs during EEA development that\u00a0harbor distinct molecular bases and demonstrates the biological relevance of these differential tumorigenic processes.

Abstract: The treatment of unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer has evolved over the last two decades, as knowledge of cancer biology has broadened and new targets have emerged. 'The Hallmarks of Cancer' illustrate the crucial capabilities acquired by cells to become malignant and represent the evolution of knowledge of tumor biology. This review integrates these novel targets and therapies into selected hallmarks: sustaining proliferative signaling, inducing vasculature, avoiding immune destruction, genome instability and mutation, reprogramming cellular metabolism, and resisting cell death. The different strategies and combinations under study are based on treatments with anti-EGFR, anti-VEGF, and anti-HER2 agents, KRAS G12C inhibitors, BRAF and MEK inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, new approaches are emerging, including vaccines, WEE1 inhibitors, and PARP inhibitors, among others. The further deciphering of cancer biology will unravel new targets, develop novel therapies, and improve patients' outcomes. Journal: International journal of molecular sciences. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Multi-omics-based subtyping of melanoma suggests distinct immune and targeted therapy strategies.. Abstract: Melanoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with diverse molecular and clinical behaviors. A precise molecular classification is critical for improving prognostic assessment and guiding personalized therapy. We performed an integrative multi-omics analysis of skin cutaneous melanoma using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and validated our findings in independent cohorts. Multi-layered data, including transcriptomic, genomic, epigenetic, and immune landscape profiles, were analyzed using unsupervised clustering and machine learning approaches to define molecular subtypes. Functional assays and in silico drug screening were employed to explore subtype-specific vulnerabilities. Three robust molecular subtypes (CS1, CS2, CS3) were identified, each with distinct genomic alterations, tumor microenvironment characteristics, and clinical outcomes. The CS2 subtype was immunologically \"hot,\" characterized by high tumor mutational burden (TMB), elevated neoantigen load, strong immune infiltration, and activated IFN-\u03b3 signaling. CS2 tumors showed significant enrichment of immune checkpoint gene expression and were associated with favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy in external validation cohorts. In contrast, CS1 and CS3 were immunologically \"cold\" with immune exclusion, high chromosomal instability, and activation of oncogenic pathways linked to immune evasion. Transcriptomic drug sensitivity modeling suggested that CS1 and CS3 may benefit from HSP90 or MEK inhibitors. Moreover, COL11A2 was identified as a subtype-enriched oncogenic driver predominantly expressed in CS1/CS3, and its silencing impaired tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) features. This study presents a refined multi-omics classification of melanoma that reveals biologically and clinically distinct subtypes with divergent immune and therapeutic profiles. It offers a framework for subtype-specific treatment strategies, and identifies COL11A2 as a potential target in immune-cold melanomas. Journal: Frontiers in immunology. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Prostate epithelial genes define therapy-relevant prostate cancer molecular subtype.. Abstract: Transcriptomic landscape of prostate cancer (PCa) shows multidimensional variability, potentially arising from the cell-of-origin, reflected in serum markers, and most importantly related to drug sensitivities. For example, Aggressive Variant Prostate Cancer (AVPC) presents low PSA per tumor burden, and characterized by de novo resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARIs). Understanding PCa transcriptomic complexity can provide biological insight and therapeutic guidance. However, unsupervised clustering analysis is hindered by potential confounding factors such as stromal contamination and stress-related material degradation. To focus on prostate epithelial cell-relevant heterogeneity, we defined 1,629 genes expressed by prostate epithelial cells by analyzing publicly available bulk and single- cell RNA sequencing data. Consensus clustering and CIBERSORT deconvolution were used for class discovery and proportion estimate analysis. The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma dataset served as a training set. The resulting clusters were analyzed in association with clinical, pathologic, and genomic characteristics and impact on survival. Serum markers PSA and PAP was analyzed to predict response to docetaxel chemotherapy in metastatic setting. We identified two luminal subtypes and two aggressive variant subtypes of PCa: luminal A (Adipogenic/AR-active/PSA-high) (30.0%); luminal S (Secretory/PAP-high) (26.0%); AVPC-I (Immune-infiltrative) (14.7%), AVPC-M (Myc-active) (4.2%), and mixed (25.0%). AVPC-I and AVPC-M subtypes predicted to be resistant to ARI and have low PSA per tumor burden. Luminal A and AVPC-M predicted to be resistant to docetaxel and have high PSA/PAP Ratio. Metastatic PCa patients with high PSA/PAP ratio (>20) had significantly shorter progression-free survival than those with low ratio (\u226420) following docetaxel chemotherapy. We propose four prostate adenocarcinoma subtypes with distinct transcriptomic, genomic, and pathologic characteristics. PSA/PAP ratio in advanced cancer may aid in determining which patients would benefit from maximized androgen receptor inhibition or early use of antimicrotubule agents.

Abstract: Late relapses of Wilms tumour are extremely uncommon but still represent possible events. Even more rarely Wilms tumours present as extrarenal neoplasms, for which it could be difficult to diagnose and treat them promptly.We present a unique case of late recurrence of Wilms tumour 16 years after the primary diagnosis, with location in the gynaecological system. The relapse presented as a vaginal mass, and it gradually raised up to involve the majority of pelvic organs. We accurately studied the tumour extension, even realising a 3D preoperative reconstruction, and we managed to evaluate the patient with a multidisciplinary team involving general surgeons, urologists, gynaecologists and plastic surgeons. We finally decided for an extended surgical approach and realised a complete pelvic exenteration. Three months after surgery, the patient is in a good general condition, without major surgical complications and with no radiological signs of pelvic tumour relapse. Journal: BMJ case reports.

Curated WGTS features and a CUP prediction algorithm (CUPPA) trained on WGTS data of known cancer types informs TOO in 71% of cases otherwise undiagnosed by clinicopathology review. WGTS informs treatments for 79% of patients, compared to 59% by panel testing. Finally, WGS of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from patients with a high cfDNA tumour fraction (>7%), enables high-likelihood CUPPA predictions in 41% of cases. WGTS is therefore superior to panel testing, broadens treatment options, and is feasible using routine pathology samples and cfDNA. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Cancers of the digestive system are major contributors to global cancer-associated morbidity and mortality, accounting for 35% of annual cases of cancer deaths. The etiologies, molecular features, and therapeutic management of these cancer entities are highly heterogeneous and complex. Over the last decade, genomic and functional studies have provided unprecedented insights into the biology of digestive cancers, identifying genetic drivers of tumor progression and key interaction points of tumor cells with the immune system. This knowledge is continuously translated into novel treatment concepts and targets, which are dynamically reshaping the therapeutic landscape of these tumors. In this review, we provide a concise overview of the etiology and molecular pathology of the six most common cancers of the digestive system, including esophageal, gastric, biliary tract, pancreatic, hepatocellular, and colorectal cancers. We comprehensively describe the current stage-dependent pharmacological management of these malignancies, including chemo-, targeted, and immunotherapy. For each cancer entity, we provide an overview of recent therapeutic advancements and research progress. Finally, we describe how novel insights into tumor heterogeneity and immune evasion deepen our understanding of therapy resistance and provide an outlook on innovative therapeutic strategies that will shape the future management of digestive cancers, including CAR-T cell therapy, novel antibody-drug conjugates and targeted therapies.

Abstract: To define the growing significance of cellular targets and/or effectors of cancer drugs, we examined the fitness dependency of cellular targets and effectors of cancer drug targets across human cancer cells from 19 cancer types. We observed that the deletion of 35 out of 47 cellular effectors and/or targets of oncology drugs did not result in the expected loss of cell fitness in appropriate cancer types for which drugs targeting or utilizing these molecules for their actions were approved. Additionally, our analysis recognized 43 cellular molecules as fitness genes in several cancer types in which these drugs were not approved, and thus, providing clues for repurposing certain approved oncology drugs in such cancer types. For example, we found a widespread upregulation and fitness dependency of several components of the mevalonate and purine biosynthesis pathways (currently targeted by bisphosphonates, statins, and pemetrexed in certain cancers) and an association between the overexpression of these molecules and reduction in the overall survival duration of patients with breast and other hard-to-treat cancers, for which such drugs are not approved. In brief, the present analysis raised cautions about off-target and undesirable effects of certain oncology drugs in a subset of cancers where the intended cellular effectors of drug might not be good fitness genes and that this study offers a potential rationale for repurposing certain approved oncology drugs for targeted therapeutics in additional cancer types.

While complete CD38 loss is not observed upon relapses after treatment with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), there is downregulation of surface CD38 expression and decreased number and function of NK cells, which renders these patients resistant to retreatment with anti-CD38 mAb. Here, we provide preclinical evidence that RRMM patients previously exposed to anti-CD38 mAb could benefit from T-cell-based immunotherapy that depend less on CD38 antigen density and NK-cell activity, such as the novel CD38/CD3xCD28 trispecific T-cell engager, SAR442257.

Abstract: T-ALL relapses are characterized by chemotherapy resistance, cellular diversity and dismal outcome. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying relapses, we conduct single-cell RNA sequencing on 13 matched pediatric T-ALL patient-derived samples at diagnosis and relapse, along with samples derived from 5 non-relapsing patients collected at diagnosis. This comprehensive longitudinal single-cell study in T-ALL reveals significant transcriptomic diversity. Notably, 11 out of 18 samples exhibit a subpopulation of T-ALL cells with stem-like features characterized by a common set of active regulons, expression patterns and splice isoforms. This subpopulation, accounting for a small proportion of leukemia cells at diagnosis, expands substantially at relapse, indicating resistance to therapy. Strikingly, increased stemness at diagnosis is associated with higher risk of treatment induction failure. Chemotherapy resistance is validated through in-vitro and in-vivo drug testing. Thus, we report the discovery of treatment-resistant stem-like cells in T-ALL, underscoring the potential for devising future therapeutic strategies targeting stemness-related pathways.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Interactions between cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages in tumor microenvironment.. Abstract: Tumor microenvironment (TME) refers to the local environment in which various cancer cells grow, encompassing tumor cells, adjacent non-tumor cells, and associated non-cellular elements, all of which collectively promote cancer occurrence and progression. As a principal immune component in the TME, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) exert a considerable influence on cancer behaviors via their interactions with cancer cells. The interactive loops between cancer cells and TAMs, including secretory factors derived from both cancer cells and TAMs, are crucial for the proliferation, stemness, drug resistance, invasion, migration, metastasis, and immune escape of various cancers. Cancer cells release paracrine proteins (HMGB1, AREG etc.), cytokines (IL-6, CCL2 etc.), RNAs (miR-21-5p, circPLEKHM1, LINC01812 etc.), and metabolites (lactic acid, succinate etc.) to regulate the polarization phenotype, mediator secretion and function of TAMs. In turn, mediators (TGF-\u03b2, IL-10, IL-6 etc.) from TAMs promote cancer progression. This review summarizes recent advancements in the interactive loops between cancer cells and TAMs in TME. Inhibiting the recruitment and M2 polarization of TAMs, reprogramming TAMs from M2 to M1 phenotype, blocking TAMs-mediated immunosuppression and immune escape, and combining with existing immunotherapy can target TAMs to overcome immunotherapy resistance in various cancers. The new breakthroughs lie in identifying effective targets for drug development, improving the drug delivery system to enhance the drug delivery efficiency, and adopting combined therapy. Interventions targeting secretory factors, cell surface receptors, intracellular signaling pathways, and metabolic modulation in the interactive loops between cancer cells and TAMs are expected to suppress cancer progression and improve therapeutic effects.

Abstract: Cancer cells optimize oncogenic signaling to maintain a defined range for survival. The success of targeted therapeutic inhibitors is based on suppressing signaling below this optimal fitness zone. Conversely, cancers are also susceptible to a clinically underutilized vulnerability - oncogenic hyperactivation. Cytotoxic hyperactivation is observed across diverse cancers, with direct small-molecule activators and inhibitors of negative regulators inducing lethal pathway activation. Deep characterization of the cancer genome and unbiased screening approaches have yielded multiple targets vulnerable to hyperactivation; however, translation into the clinical setting will require defining signaling thresholds, discovering biomarkers, and developing appropriate trial designs. By exploiting cancer's intrinsic vulnerabilities, activation lethality offers a promising therapeutic strategy to expand the treatment landscape and overcome resistance to targeted inhibition.

Abstract: Nowadays medulloblastoma (MB) tumors can be treated with risk-stratified approaches with up to 80% success rate. However, disease relapses occur in approximately 30% of patients and successful salvage treatment strategies at relapse remain scarce. Acquired copy number changes or TP53 mutations are known to occur frequently in relapses, while methylation profiles usually remain highly similar to those of the matching primary tumors, indicating that in general molecular subgrouping does not change during the course of the disease. In the current study, we have used RNA sequencing data to analyze the transcriptome profiles of 43 primary-relapse MB pairs in order to identify specific molecular features of relapses within various tumor groups. Gene variance analysis between primary and relapse samples demonstrated the impact of age in SHH-MB: the changes in gene expression relapse profiles were more pronounced in the younger patients (<\u200910\u00a0years old), which were also associated with increased DNA aberrations and somatic mutations at relapse probably driving this effect. For Group 3/4\u00a0MB transcriptome data analysis uncovered clear sets of genes either active or decreased at relapse that are significantly associated with survival, thus could be potential predictive markers. In addition, deconvolution analysis of bulk transcriptome data identified progression-associated differences in cell type enrichment. The proportion of undifferentiated progenitors increased in SHH-MB relapses with a concomitant decrease of differentiated neuron-like cells, while in Group 3/4\u00a0MB relapses cell cycle activity increases and differentiated neuron-like cells proportion decreases as well. Thus, our findings uncovered significant transcriptome changes in the molecular signatures of relapsed MB and could be potentially useful for further clinical purposes.

Abstract: Nanoscale engineering is one of the innovative approaches to heal multitudes of ailments, such as varieties of malignancies, neurological problems, and infectious illnesses. Therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) may be modified in aspect because of their ability to stimulate physiological response while limiting negative consequences by interfacing and activating possible targets. Nanomaterials have been extensively studied and employed for cancerous therapeutic strategies since nanomaterials potentially play a significant role in medical transportation. When compared to conventional drug delivery, nanocarriers drug delivery offers various benefits, such as excellent reliability, bioactivity, improved penetration and retention impact, as well as precise targeting and administering. Upregulation of drug efflux transporters, dysfunctional apoptotic mechanisms, and a hypoxic atmosphere are all elements that lead to cancer treatment sensitivity in humans. It has been possible to target these pathways using nanoparticles and increase the effectiveness of multidrug resistance treatments. As innovative strategies of tumor chemoresistance are uncovered, nanomaterials are being developed to target specific pathways of tumor resilience. Scientists have recently begun investigating the function of nanoparticles in immunotherapy, a field that is becoming increasingly useful in the care of malignancies. Nanoscale therapeutics have been explored in this scientific literature and represent the most current approaches to neurodegenerative illnesses and cancer therapy. In addition, current findings and various biomedical nanomaterials' future promise for tissue regeneration, prospective medication design, and the synthesis of novel delivery approaches have been emphasized.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNAs that repress the expression of a broad array of target genes. Many efforts have been made to therapeutically target miRNAs in cancer treatments using miRNA mimics and miRNA antagonists. Areas covered: This article summarizes the recent findings with the role of miRNAs in lung cancer, and discusses the potential and challenges of developing miRNA-targeted therapeutics in this dreadful disease. Expert opinion: The development of miRNA-targeted therapeutics has become an important anti-cancer strategy. Results from both preclinical and clinical trials of microRNA replacement therapy have shown some promise in cancer treatment. However, some obstacles, including drug delivery, specificity, off-target effect, toxicity mediation, immunological activation and dosage determination should be addressed. Several delivery strategies have been employed, including naked oligonucleotides, liposomes, aptamer-conjugates, nanoparticles and viral vectors. However, delivery remains a main challenge in miRNA-targeting therapeutics.

Abstract: The Hippo pathway has emerged as a critical player in both cancers and targeted therapy resistance. Recent drug discovery efforts have led to the development of TEAD inhibitors, several of which have already progressed to the clinic. To truly leverage their potential as anticancer therapeutics, safety considerations, particularly in regard to the kidney, warrant additional investigation. This review explores the Hippo pathway's role in cancers, its therapeutic potential, role in kidney development, and the need to evaluate the best strategies to translate its clinical application for long-term patient benefit.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cancer stem cell populations in lymphoma in dogs and impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy.. Abstract: Cancer relapse following chemotherapy has been attributed in part to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSC), which drive tumour growth and metastasis and are highly resistant to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. As a result, treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy selects for drug-resistant CSC populations that eventually drive tumour recurrence. Little is known currently regarding the role of CSC in dogs with lymphoma, nor the impact of chemotherapy on CSC populations. Therefore, we prospectively quantitated CSC populations in dogs with B-cell (BCL) and T-cell lymphoma (TCL), using tumour aspirates and flow cytometric analysis with a panel of CSC markers. In addition, in vitro studies were carried out to determine the impact of chemotherapy resistance on the stem cell phenotype and stem cell properties of lymphoma cells. We found that the percentages of tumour cells expressing CSC markers were significantly increased in dogs with BCL, compared with B cells from normal lymph nodes. Similar findings were observed in dogs with TCL. In vitro studies revealed that lymphoma cells selected for resistance to CHOP chemotherapy had significantly upregulated expression of CSC markers, formed spheroids in culture more readily, and expressed significantly greater aldehyde dehydrogenase activity compared with chemotherapy-sensitive tumour cells. Similar results were observed in tumour samples dogs with relapsed BCL. These findings suggest that cytotoxic chemotherapy can lead to a relative enrichment of tumour cells with CSC properties, which may be associated with lymphoma recurrence.

Abstract: Co-expression analysis is widely used to predict gene function and to identify functionally related gene sets. However, co-expression analysis using human cancer transcriptomic data is confounded by somatic copy number alterations (SCNA), which produce co-expression signatures based on physical proximity rather than biological function. To better understand gene-gene co-expression based on biological regulation but not SCNA, we describe a method termed \"Genomic Regression Analysis of Coordinated Expression\" (GRACE) to adjust for the effect of SCNA in co-expression analysis. The results from analyses of TCGA, CCLE, and NCI60 data sets show that GRACE can improve our understanding of how a transcriptional network is re-wired in cancer.

Abstract: Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) are two common and aggressive subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma. The aim of this study was to assess potential transcriptomic differences between MFS and UPS tumours and to evaluate the extent to which differences in gene expression profiles were associated with genomic and clinical features. The study included 162 patients with tumours diagnosed as MFS (N\u2009=\u200962) or UPS (N\u2009=\u2009100). The patients had been diagnosed and treated at two Swedish sarcoma centres during a 30-year period. For gene expression profiling and gene fusion detection all tumours were analysed using RNA-sequencing and could be compared with data on clinical outcome (N\u2009=\u2009155), global copy number profiles (N\u2009=\u2009145), and gene mutations (N\u2009=\u2009128). Gene expression profiling revealed three transcriptomic clusters (TCs) without any clear separation of MFS and UPS. One TC was associated with longer metastasis-free survival. These tumours had lower tumour mutation burden (TMB), were enriched for a copy number signature representative of focal LOH and chromosomal instability on a diploid background, and were relatively immune-depleted. MFS and UPS showed extensive genomic overlap, with whole genome doubling occurring more frequently among the latter. The results support the idea that MFS and UPS tumours have largely overlapping genomic and transcriptomic features, with UPS tumours showing more aggressive behaviour and more complex genomes. Independently of the tumour type, clinically relevant subgroups were revealed by gene expression analysis, and the finding of multiple genomic subgroups strongly suggest the existence of subgroups of relevance to treatment stratification. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

Abstract: To assess the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents, such as androgen receptor axis-targeted agents (ARATs) and cabazitaxel, for relapse of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after docetaxel in real-world practice, we performed a subanalysis using database from PROSTAT-BSI, a prospective observational study to evaluate the utility of software for quantifying bone metastases on bone scintigraphy. Patients with clinically relapsed mCRPC after docetaxel treatment who received the new agents (NEW group) and those who did not (standard of care, SOC group) were included; patients who received ARAT before DOC treatment were excluded. Overall survival (OS) after docetaxel treatment was compared between the NEW and SOC groups. Patients in the NEW group had significantly better OS from the start of docetaxel than those in the SOC group (the median OS in NEW and SOC was 28.9 months vs. 14.5 months, respectively). Furthermore, regardless of the time from androgen-deprivation therapy to the start of docetaxel at mCRPC, the NEW group had a better OS from relapse after docetaxel than the SOC group. In clinical practice, OS of patients with relapse after docetaxel was significantly improved in the NEW group over the SOC group. Journal: Anticancer research. Year: 2022.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Identification of novel breast cancer-associated transcripts by UniGene database mining and gene expression analysis in normal and malignant cells.. Abstract: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous and complex disease. Although the use of tumor biomarkers has improved individualized breast cancer care, i.e., assessment of risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment outcome, new markers are required to further improve patient clinical management. In the present study, a search for novel breast cancer-associated genes was performed by mining the UniGene database for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) originating from human normal breast, breast cancer tissue, or breast cancer cell lines. Two hundred and twenty-eight distinct breast-associated UniGene Clusters (BUC1-228) matched the search criteria. Four BUC ESTs (BUC6, BUC9, BUC10, and BUC11) were subsequently selected for extensive in silico database searches, and in vitro analyses through sequencing and RT-PCR based assays on well-characterized cell lines and tissues of normal and cancerous origin. BUC6, BUC9, BUC10, and BUC11 are clustered on 10p11.21-12.1 and showed no homology to any known RNAs. Overall, expression of the four BUC transcripts was high in normal breast and testis tissue, and in some breast cancers; in contrast, BUC was low in other normal tissues, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and other cancer cell lines. Results to-date suggest that BUC11 and BUC9 translate to protein and BUC11 cytoplasmic and nuclear protein expression was detected in a large cohort of breast cancer samples using immunohistochemistry. This study demonstrates the discovery and expression analysis of a tissue-restricted novel transcript set which is strongly expressed in breast tissue and their application as clinical cancer biomarkers clearly warrants further investigation.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Topoisomerase levels determine chemotherapy response in vitro and in vivo.. Abstract: Topoisomerase poisons are chemotherapeutic agents that are used extensively for treating human malignancies. These drugs can be highly effective, yet tumors are frequently refractory to treatment or become resistant upon tumor relapse. Using a pool-based RNAi screening approach and a well characterized mouse model of lymphoma, we explored the genetic basis for heterogeneous responses to topoisomerase poisons in vitro and in vivo. These experiments identified Top2A expression levels as major determinants of response to the topoisomerase 2 poison doxorubicin and showed that suppression of Top2A produces resistance to doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo. Analogously, using a targeted RNAi approach, we demonstrated that suppression of Top1 produces resistance to the topoisomerase 1 poison camptothecin yet hypersensitizes cancer cells to doxorubicin. Importantly, lymphomas relapsing after treatment display spontaneous changes in topoisomerase levels as predicted by in vitro gene knockdown studies. These results highlight the utility of pooled shRNA screens for identifying genetic determinants of chemotherapy response and suggest strategies for improving the effectiveness of topoisomerase poisons in the clinic.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer relapsing 6-12 months post platinum-based chemotherapy.. Abstract: Platinum-containing regimens are the mainstay of initial treatment for ovarian cancer and for platinum-sensitive recurrent disease. In recurrent ovarian cancer, the effectiveness of platinum retreatment is dependent on the relapse-free and treatment-free intervals. Platinum agents can be effectively re-administered to patients with disease that relapses >12 months after completion of a platinum regimen. Ovarian cancer that relapses 6-12 months after treatment with a platinum regimen is considered partially platinum sensitive. Phase III studies of combination regimens versus platinum monotherapy and comparing various non-platinum agents administered as monotherapy generally do not report separate data for partially platinum-sensitive patients. Studies reporting data in patients with a platinum-free interval > or =6 months demonstrate advantages for pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) versus paclitaxel and PLD versus topotecan. A platinum-taxane combination or single-agent PLD is recommended for the treatment of partially platinum-sensitive disease by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

Abstract: Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling is one of the main oncogenic pathways in different malignancies. Therefore, targeting this pathway has been considered an exciting strategy in cancer treatment. Porcn is among the central enzymes in this pathway that has recently been considered for cancer-targeted therapy. As a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase, Porcn plays a critical role in wnt ligand palmitoylation and its subsequent secretion. In addition to Porcn's role in stem cell signaling and differentiation, recent findings have shown its role in developing and progressing colorectal, pancreatic, liver, head, and neck cancers. Developed small molecule inhibitors have also opened a promising window toward cancer treatment strategies. In this review, the structure and biological role of Porcn in different cancer-related signaling pathways and inhibitors used for inhibiting this enzyme are discussed.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OV) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy owing to its late diagnosis and high metastatic propensity. Current biomarkers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for the detection of early-stage cancer. To address this gap, we integrated single-cell transcriptomic profiling of tumor tissues with analysis of circulating exosomal RNA, aiming to uncover candidate markers that reflect tumor heterogeneity and metastatic potential and that may serve as sensitive, non-invasive diagnostics. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from primary tumors and metastatic lesions with bulk tissue transcriptomes and plasma-derived exosomal RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared across tumor cells, metastatic subpopulations, and exosomes were identified through intersection analysis. Candidate genes were validated in clinical specimens using qPCR and immunohistochemistry. We then applied ten machine learning algorithm to exosomal transcriptomic data to evaluate diagnostic performance and identify the optimal classifier. Tumor cell differentiation states were evaluated using CytoTRACE, and intercellular communication was analyzed with CellChat. Intersection analysis highlighted 52 overlapping DEGs, of which SCNN1A and EFNA1 emerged as the top prognostic indicators. Both genes were significantly upregulated in tumor tissues, metastatic foci, and plasma exosomes (<i>P</i> < 0.01). The exosome-based Adaboost model had an area under the curve of 0.955 in an independent test cohort. Single-cell subcluster analyses revealed high SCNN1A/EFNA1 expression correlated with stem-like differentiation states and enriched pathways associated with immune evasion and adhesion. CellChat analysis demonstrated that highly differentiated tumor cells extensively engaged with fibroblasts and endothelial cells, implying their role in niche formation. By coupling single-cell, bulk tissue, and exosomal transcriptomics, we elucidated the key molecular drivers of OV metastasis and established SCNN1A and EFNA1 as promising non-invasive biomarkers. This multi-omics framework provides an effective strategy for early detection and a better understanding of metastatic progression in OV. Journal: Frontiers in immunology. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Coordinated dysregulation of cancer progression by the HER family and p21-activated kinases.. Abstract: Most epithelial cancer types are polygenic in nature and are driven by coordinated dysregulation of multiple regulatory pathways, genes, and protein modifications. The process of coordinated regulation of cancer promoting pathways in response to extrinsic and intrinsic signals facilitates the dysregulation of several pathways with complementary functions, contributing to the hallmarks of cancer. Dysregulation and hyperactivation of cell surface human epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs) and cytoskeleton remodeling by p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are two prominent interconnected aspects of oncogenesis. We briefly discuss the discoveries and significant advances in the area of coordinated regulation of HERs and PAKs in the development and progression of breast and other epithelial cancers. We also discuss how initial studies involving heregulin signaling via HER3-HER2 axis and HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells not only discovered a mechanistic role of PAK1 in breast cancer pathobiology but also acted as a bridge in generating a broader cancer research interest in other PAK family members and cancer types and catalyzed establishing the role of PAKs in human cancer, at-large. In addition, growth factor stimulation of the PAK pathway also helped to recognize new facets of PAKs, connecting the PAK pathway to oncogenesis, nuclear signaling, gene expression, mitotic progression, DNA damage response, among other phenotypic responses, and shaped the field of PAK cancer research. Finally, we recount some of the current limitations of HER- and PAK-directed therapeutics in counteracting acquired therapeutic resistance and discuss how cancer's as a polygenic disease may be best targeted with a polygenic approach.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cancer Therapies and Vascular Toxicities.. Abstract: Vascular events have become an important issue in the overall management of cancer patients. They usually result from a combination of (i) direct or indirect toxicity of anticancer treatments, (ii) a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in cancer patients, and (iii) prolonged exposure to treatments due to an increasing patient survival rate. In addition to conventional chemotherapies and radiotherapy, targeted therapies and immunotherapies have been developed which improve the prognosis of cancer patients but sometimes at the cost of vascular toxicity, which can lead to systemic or pulmonary hypertension and arterial/venous thromboembolic events. Endothelial dysfunction, a procoagulant state and metabolic disorders are the three main pathophysiological patterns leading to cancer treatment-related vascular toxicity. This issue is challenging because serious vascular adverse events can necessitate cancer treatment being put on hold or stopped, which could compromise patient survival. In addition to increasing the risk of thrombotic adverse events, cancer therapies may lead to an increased risk of bleeding, especially in treatments with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors. Therefore, we can define vasculo-oncology as a part of the cardio-oncology specialty; its aims are to predict, prevent, screen, and treat vascular toxicity related to cancer treatments. While the level of evidence is low regarding the management of vascular toxicity during cancer therapy, cardiologists and specialists in vascular diseases should closely collaborate with oncologists and hematologists to determine the optimal strategy for each patient.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Unmasking the tumourigenic role of SIN1/MAPKAP1 in the mTOR complex 2.. Abstract: Although the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is one of the most altered pathways in human tumours, therapies targeting this pathway have shown numerous adverse effects due to positive feedback paradoxically activating upstream signaling nodes. The somewhat limited clinical efficacy of these inhibitors calls for the development of novel and more effective approaches for targeting the PI3K pathway for therapeutic benefit in cancer. Recent studies have shown the central role of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) as a pro-tumourigenic factor of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in a number of cancers. SIN1/MAPKAP1 is a major partner of mTORC2, acting as a scaffold and responsible for the substrate specificity of the mTOR catalytic subunit. Its overexpression promotes the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of certain cancers whereas its inhibition decreases tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. It is also involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stress response and lipogenesis. Moreover, the numerous interactions of SIN1 inside or outside mTORC2 connect it with other signaling pathways, which are often disrupted in human tumours such as Hippo, WNT, Notch and MAPK. Therefore, SIN1's fundamental characteristics and numerous connexions with oncogenic pathways make it a particularly interesting therapeutic target. This review is an opportunity to highlight the tumourigenic role of SIN1 across many solid cancers and demonstrates the importance of targeting SIN1 with a specific therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Improving glioma drug delivery: A multifaceted approach for glioma drug development.. Abstract: Glioma is one of the most common central nervous system (CNS) cancers that can be found within the brain and the spinal cord. One of the pressing issues plaguing the development of therapeutics for glioma originates from the selective and semipermeable CNS membranes: the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB). It is difficult to bypass these membranes and target the desired cancerous tissue because the purpose of the BBB and BSCB is to filter toxins and foreign material from invading CNS spaces. There are currently four varieties of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug treatment for glioma; yet these therapies have limitations including, but not limited to, relatively low transmission through the BBB/BSCB, despite pharmacokinetic characteristics that allow them to cross the barriers. Steps must be taken to improve the development of novel and repurposed glioma treatments through the consideration of pharmacological profiles and innovative drug delivery techniques. This review addresses current FDA-approved glioma treatments' gaps, shortcomings, and challenges. We then outline how incorporating computational BBB/BSCB models and innovative drug delivery mechanisms will help motivate clinical advancements in glioma drug delivery. Ultimately, considering these attributes will improve the process of novel and repurposed drug development in glioma and the efficacy of glioma treatment. Journal: Pharmacological research.

Abstract: Over the recent years, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies targeting the microRNA transcriptome revealed the existence of many different RNA fragments derived from small RNA species other than microRNA. Although initially discarded as RNA turnover artifacts, accumulating evidence suggests that RNA fragments derived from small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) are not just random degradation products but rather stable entities, which may have functional activity in the normal and malignant cell. This review summarizes new findings describing the detection and alterations in expression of snoRNA-derived (sdRNA) and tRNA-derived (tRF) RNAs. We focus on the possible interactions of sdRNAs and tRFs with the canonical microRNA pathways in the cell and present current hypotheses on the function of these RNAs. Journal: Cancer letters.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Multimodal profiling of oral squamous cell carcinoma identifies genomic alterations and expression programs associated with betel quid chewing.. Abstract: Betel quid (BQ) chewing is a profound risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in Southeast Asia. Yet, the detailed mechanisms by which BQ chewing damages the genome and creates a unique tumor niche that ultimately cause OSCC are still not fully understood. To address this, we conducted a multi-omics survey, including exome sequencing of tumor-normal pairs from 261 male patients with OSCC (129 habitual BQ chewers and 132 non-BQ users), alone with integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics of a set of tumors. Comparative analyses of the mutational catalog identified enrichment of significantly altered genes (e.g. mutations of TP53 and CHUK, copy gains of MAP3K13 and FADD, copy losses of CDKN2A) associated with BQ chewing. Assessment of oncogenic and co-occurring actionable alterations demonstrated frequently altered oncogenic pathways (Hippo and p53 signaling) and potential combination therapy opportunities linked to BQ use. In addition, evaluation of epithelial, immune, stromal expression programs in the corresponding tissue compartments revealed a shift of tumor microenvironment in BQ-related OSCC, characterized by induced hypoxia of tumor epithelium, altered immunosuppression of dendritic cells, and raised sprouting angiogenesis of tumor endothelium. Quantitative predictions of intercellular communications inferred a more heterogeneous cell-cell crosstalk among BQ-related OSCC, highlighted by extensive interactions of fibroblasts and dendritic cells with other non-epithelial cell types via mostly extracellular matrix-receptor signaling pathways. Collectively, these differences in genomic landscape and tumor niche suggest that OSCC caused by BQ chewing could be an etiological subtype different from their BQ-negative counterparts.

Abstract: Urothelial carcinoma is an aggressive entity that is associated with significant morbidity, but there have been major advances in both our understanding of and treatment options for patients with this disease. In this review, the authors focus on novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches in the perioperative setting, with an emphasis on patient-centered and individualized care. For urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), advances in nonplatinum-based therapies, specifically immunotherapy and antibody-drug conjugates, have expanded the therapeutic arsenal for patients with muscle-invasive UCB in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings to improve survival outcomes. Given the significant morbidity of extirpative surgery (radical cystectomy and urinary diversion), there have also been greater efforts to evaluate bladder-sparing protocols and improve the selection of patients for surgery and their postoperative recovery. The authors review special considerations for organ-sparing surgery in females, geriatric co-management, and enhanced recovery after surgery protocols. For upper tract urothelial carcinoma, there has been increasing recognition of its unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, including risks of renal functional loss. There have been advances in molecular profiling that have demonstrated various genomic differences between upper tract urothelial carcinoma and UCB, with treatment implications. This article reviews studies evaluating perioperative care that focused on optimizing therapeutic approaches, including neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, as well as nephron-sparing strategies in carefully selected cases.

Abstract: The main objective of this study was to explore and identify new genetic targets in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) through transcriptomics analysis and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, which will help in the subsequent development of new therapeutic interventions. In this study, we extracted the SCLC dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, processed the data, and screened out differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using R software. Based on expression quantitative trait loci data and the genome-wide association study data of SCLC, MR analysis was used to screen the genes closely related to SCLC disease, which intersect with DEGs to obtain co-expressed genes (CEGs), and the biological functions and pathways of CEGs were further explored by enrichment analysis. In addition, the CIBERSORT algorithm was applied to assess the level of immune cell infiltration in SCLC and to analyze the correlation between CEGs and immune cells. Meanwhile, we performed a survival analysis on these five CEGs using an independent cohort of SCLC patients. Finally, the results for the target genes were validated. In this study, 857 DEGs were identified, including 443 up-regulated and 414 down-regulated genes, and 5 CEGs (<i>PSAT1, PSRC1, COLEC12, PLLP, HP</i>) that were significantly associated with SCLC were identified through further intersecting. The results of enrichment analyses indicated that CEGs play important roles in several key functions and pathways. Immune-cell-related analysis revealed the unique distribution of immune cell infiltration in SCLC and the mechanism of immune cell regulation by CEGs. Survival analysis results indicated that <i>PSRC1</i> was significantly correlated with the overall survival of SCLC, and the survival rate of the high-expression group was markedly lower than that of the low-expression group. Finally, the consistency of the results between the validation group analyses and MR analysis confirmed that the results of this study is reliable. The CEGs and their associated functions and pathways screened in this study may be potential targets of therapeutic intervention in SCLC by targeting specific molecular pathways.

A plethora of studies have attempted to explain this phenomenon and many mechanisms of resistance have been suggested over recent decades. The concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which describes tumors as hierarchically organized, has added a new level of complexity to therapy failure. CSCs are the root of cancers and resist chemo- and radiotherapy, explaining cancer recurrence even many years after therapy is ended. This review discusses briefly CSCs in cancers, gives an overview of the role of CSCs in therapy resistance, and discusses the potential means of targeting these therapy-resistant tumor cells.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Host-Gut Microbiota Metabolic Interactions and Their Role in Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Gastrointestinal Cancers.. Abstract: The critical role of the gut microbiome in gastrointestinal cancers is becoming increasingly clear. Imbalances in the gut microbial community, referred to as dysbiosis, are linked to increased risks for various forms of gastrointestinal cancers. Pathogens like Fusobacterium and Helicobacter pylori relate to the onset of esophageal and gastric cancers, respectively, while microbes such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Clostridium species have been associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer. In colorectal cancer, bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum are known to stimulate the growth of tumor cells and trigger cancer-promoting pathways. On the other hand, beneficial microbes like Bifidobacteria offer a protective effect, potentially inhibiting the development of gastrointestinal cancers. The potential for therapeutic interventions that manipulate the gut microbiome is substantial, including strategies to engineer anti-tumor metabolites and employ microbiota-based treatments. Despite the progress in understanding the influence of the microbiome on gastrointestinal cancers, significant challenges remain in identifying and understanding the precise contributions of specific microbial species and their metabolic products. This knowledge is essential for leveraging the role of the gut microbiome in the development of precise diagnostics and targeted therapies for gastrointestinal cancers.

Abstract: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective treatments for non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, relapse typically occurs after an average of 1 year of continuous treatment. A fundamental histological transformation from NSCLC to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is observed in a subset of the resistant cancers, but the molecular changes associated with this transformation remain unknown. Analysis of tumour samples and cell lines derived from resistant EGFR mutant patients revealed that Retinoblastoma (RB) is lost in 100% of these SCLC transformed cases, but rarely in those that remain NSCLC. Further, increased neuroendocrine marker and decreased EGFR expression as well as greater sensitivity to BCL2 family inhibition are observed in resistant SCLC transformed cancers compared with resistant NSCLCs. Together, these findings suggest that this subset of resistant cancers ultimately adopt many of the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of classical SCLC. Journal: Nature communications.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The emerging role of noncoding RNAs in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway in breast cancer.. Abstract: Breast cancer persists as a major problem for the world's healthcare, thus it is essential to fully understand the complex molecular processes that cause its growth and development. ncRNAs had been discovered to serve critical roles in a variety of cellular functions, including the regulation of signalling pathways. Within different pathways, the AKT/PI3K/mTOR signalling cascade has received a lot of interest because of its role in cancer. A complex interaction between ncRNAs, notably miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, and the AKT/PI3K/mTOR signalling pathway exerts both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive activities by targeting critical components of the pathway directly or indirectly. Through miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation, lncRNA-guided chromatin remodelling, and circRNA sequestration, ncRNAs modulate the activity of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR, influencing cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Furthermore, ncRNAs can serve as promising biomarkers for breast cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment response, as their dysregulation is commonly observed in breast cancer patients. Harnessing the potential of ncRNAs as therapeutic targets or tools for restoring pathway homeostasis holds promise for innovative treatment strategies in breast cancer. Understanding the intricate regulatory networks orchestrated by ncRNAs in this context may pave the way for novel diagnostic approaches, therapeutic interventions, and a deeper comprehension of breast cancer's molecular landscape, ultimately improving patient outcomes. This abstract underscores the emerging significance of ncRNAs in the AKT/PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway in breast cancer. Journal: Pathology, research and practice. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Multi-omics portrait of ductal carcinoma in situ in young women.. Abstract: Young patients with breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) often face a poorer prognosis. The genomic intricacies in young-onset DCIS, however, remain underexplored. To address this gap, we undertook a comprehensive study encompassing exome, transcriptome, and vmethylome analyses. Our investigation included 20 DCIS samples (including 15 young-onset DCIS) and paired samples of normal breast tissue and blood. Through RNA sequencing, we identified two distinct DCIS subgroups: \"immune hot\" and \"immune cold\". The \"immune hot\" subgroup was characterized by increased infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, elevated expression of PDCD1 and CTLA4, and reduced GATA3 expression. This group also exhibited active immunerelated transcriptional regulators. Mutational analysis revealed alterations in TP53 (38%), GATA3 (25%), and TTN (19%), with two cases showing mutations in APC, ERBB2, and SMARCC1. Common genomic alterations, irrespective of immune status, included gains in copy numbers at 1q, 8q, 17q, and 20q, and losses at 11q, 17p, and 22q. Signature analysis highlighted the predominance of signatures 2 and 1, with \"immune cold\" samples showing a significant presence of signature 8. Our methylome study on 13 DCIS samples identified 328 hyperdifferentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 521 hypo-DMRs, with \"immune cold\" cases generally showing lower levels of methylation. In summary, the molecular characteristics of young-onset DCIS share similarities with invasive breast cancer (IBC), potentially indicating a poor prognosis. Understanding these characteristics, especially the immune microenvironment of DCIS, could be pivotal in identifying new therapeutic targets and preventive strategies for breast cancer.

Abstract: The HIT-SIOP-PNET4 randomised trial for standard risk medulloblastoma (MB) (2001-2006) included 338 patients and compared hyperfractionated and conventional radiotherapy. We here report the long-term outcome after a median follow up of 7.8\u00a0years, including detailed information on relapse and the treatment of relapse. Data were extracted from the HIT Group Relapsed MB database and by way of a specific case report form. The event-free and overall (OS) survival at 10\u00a0years were 76\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009% and 78\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009% respectively with no significant difference between the treatment arms. Seventy-two relapses and three second malignant neoplasms were reported. Thirteen relapses (18\u2009%) were isolated local relapses in the posterior fossa (PF) and 59 (82\u2009%) were craniospinal, metastatic relapses (isolated or multiple) with or without concurrent PF disease. Isolated PF relapse vs all other relapses occurred at mean/median of 38/35 and 28/26\u00a0months respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.24). Late relapse, i.e. >5\u00a0years from diagnosis, occurred in six patients (8\u2009%). Relapse treatment consisted of combinations of surgery (25\u2009%), focal radiotherapy (RT 22\u2009%), high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue (HDSCR 21\u2009%) and conventional chemotherapy (90\u2009%). OS at 5\u00a0years after relapse was 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009%. In multivariate analysis; isolated relapse in PF, and surgery were significantly associated with prolonged survival whereas RT and HDSCR were not. Survival after relapse was not related to biological factors and was very poor despite several patients receiving intensive treatments. Exploration of new drugs is warranted, preferably based on tumour biology from biopsy of the relapsed tumour. Journal: Journal of neuro-oncology. Year: 2016.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Relapse-specific mutations in NT5C2 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.. Abstract: Relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) carries a poor prognosis, despite intensive retreatment, owing to intrinsic drug resistance. The biological pathways that mediate resistance are unknown. Here, we report the transcriptome profiles of matched diagnosis and relapse bone marrow specimens from ten individuals with pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia using RNA sequencing. Transcriptome sequencing identified 20 newly acquired, novel nonsynonymous mutations not present at initial diagnosis, with 2 individuals harboring relapse-specific mutations in the same gene, NT5C2, encoding a 5'-nucleotidase. Full-exon sequencing of NT5C2 was completed in 61 further relapse specimens, identifying additional mutations in 5 cases. Enzymatic analysis of mutant proteins showed that base substitutions conferred increased enzymatic activity and resistance to treatment with nucleoside analog therapies. Clinically, all individuals who harbored NT5C2 mutations relapsed early, within 36 months of initial diagnosis (P = 0.03). These results suggest that mutations in NT5C2 are associated with the outgrowth of drug-resistant clones in ALL. Journal: Nature genetics. Year: 2013.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Bioinspired soft nanovesicles for site-selective cancer imaging and targeted therapies.. Abstract: Cell-to-cell communication within the heterogeneous solid tumor environment plays a significant role in the uncontrolled metastasis of cancer. To inhibit the metastasis and growth of cancer cells, various chemically designed and biologically derived nanosized biomaterials have been applied for targeted cancer therapeutics applications. Over the years, bioinspired soft nanovesicles have gained tremendous attention for targeted cancer therapeutics due to their easy binding with tumor microenvironment, natural targeting ability, bio-responsive nature, better biocompatibility, high cargo capacity for multiple therapeutics agents, and long circulation time. These cell-derived nanovesicles guard their loaded cargo molecules from immune clearance and make them site-selective to cancer cells due to their natural binding and delivery abilities. Furthermore, bioinspired soft nanovesicles prevent cell-to-cell communication and secretion of cancer cell markers by delivering the therapeutics agents predominantly. Cell-derived vesicles, namely, exosomes, extracellular vesicles, and so forth have been recognized as versatile carriers for therapeutic biomolecules. However, low product yield, poor reproducibility, and uncontrolled particle size distribution have remained as major challenges of these soft nanovesicles. Furthermore, the surface biomarkers and molecular contents of these vesicles change with respect to the stage of disease and types. Here in this review, we have discussed numerous examples of bioinspired soft vesicles for targeted imaging and cancer therapeutic applications with their advantages and limitations. Importance of bioengineered soft nanovesicles for localized therapies with their clinical relevance has also been addressed in this article. Overall, cell-derived nanovesicles could be considered as clinically relevant platforms for cancer therapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular insight into renal cancer and latest therapeutic approaches to tackle it: an\u00a0updated\u00a0review.. Abstract: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most lethal genitourinary cancers, with the highest mortality rate, and may remain undetected throughout its development. RCC can be sporadic or hereditary. Exploring the underlying genetic abnormalities in RCC will have important implications for understanding the origins of nonhereditary renal cancers. The treatment of RCC has evolved over centuries from the era of cytokines to targeted therapy to immunotherapy. A surgical cure is the primary treatment modality, especially for organ-confined diseases. Furthermore, the urologic oncology community focuses on nephron-sparing surgical approaches and ablative procedures when small renal masses are detected incidentally in conjunction with interventional radiologists. In addition to new combination therapies approved for RCC treatment, several trials have been conducted to investigate the potential benefits of certain drugs. This may lead to durable responses and more extended survival benefits for patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC). Several approved drugs have reduced the mortality rate of patients with RCC by targeting VEGF signaling and mTOR. This review better explains the signaling pathways involved in the RCC progression, oncometabolites, and essential biomarkers in RCC that can be used for its diagnosis. Further, it provides an overview of the characteristics of RCC carcinogenesis to assist in combating treatment resistance, as well as details about the current management and future therapeutic options. In the future, multimodal and integrated care will be available, with new treatment options emerging as we learn more about the disease. Journal: Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England).

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and represents one of the top five leading causes of cancer-related mortality. Inherited and acquired genetic mutations as well as epigenetic aberrations are known to be important contributors to the development and progression of breast cancer. Recent developments in high-throughput technologies have increased our understanding of the molecular changes in breast cancer, leading to the identification of distinctive genetic and epigenetic modifications in different breast cancer molecular subtypes. These genetic and epigenetic changes in luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2/HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal-like breast cancer subtypes are discussed in this chapter. Furthermore, recent epigenome studies provided more information about further stratification of breast cancer subtypes, with essential role in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Thus, the inclusion of both genetic and epigenetic information in breast cancer clinical care could provide critical scientific base for precision medicine in breast cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Triple-negative breast cancer: is there a treatment on the horizon?. Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for 15-20% of all breast cancers, does not express estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) and lacks human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression or amplification. These tumors have a more aggressive phenotype and a poorer prognosis due to the high propensity for metastatic progression and absence of specific targeted treatments. Patients with TNBC do not benefit from hormonal or trastuzumab-based targeted therapies because of the loss of target receptors. Although these patients respond to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes and anthracyclines better than other subtypes of breast cancer, prognosis remains poor. A group of targeted therapies under investigation showed favorable results in TNBC, especially in cancers with BRCA mutation. The lipid-lowering statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors), including lovastatin and simvastatin, have been shown to preferentially target TNBC compared with non-TNBC. These statins hold great promise for the management of TNBC. Only with the understanding of the molecular basis for the preference of statins for TNBC and more investigations in clinical trials can they be reformulated into a clinically approved drug against TNBC.

Abstract: There is limited data on the clinical, cellular and molecular changes in relapsed acute promyeloytic leukemia (RAPL) in comparison with newly diagnosed cases (NAPL). We undertook a prospective study to compare NAPL and RAPL patients treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO) based regimens. 98 NAPL and 28 RAPL were enrolled in this study. RAPL patients had a significantly lower WBC count and higher platelet count at diagnosis. IC bleeds was significantly lower in RAPL cases (P=0.022). The ability of malignant promyelocytes to concentrate ATO intracellularly and their in-vitro IC50 to ATO was not significantly different between the two groups. Targeted NGS revealed PML B2 domain mutations in 4 (15.38%) of the RAPL subset and none were associated with secondary resistance to ATO. A microarray GEP revealed 1744 genes were 2 fold and above differentially expressed between the two groups. The most prominent differentially regulated pathways were cell adhesion (n=92), cell survival (n=50), immune regulation (n=74) and stem cell regulation (n=51). Consistent with the GEP data, immunophenotyping revealed significantly increased CD34 expression (P=0.001) in RAPL cases and there was in-vitro evidence of significant microenvironment mediated innate resistance (EM-DR) to ATO. Resistance and relapse following treatment with ATO is probably multi-factorial, mutations in PML B2 domain while seen only in RAPL may not be the major clinically relevant cause of subsequent relapses. In RAPL additional factors such as expansion of the leukemia initiating compartment along with EM-DR may contribute significantly to relapse following treatment with ATO based regimens.

Abstract: Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a well-known pro-inflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic activity is a central player in chronic inflammatory diseases including cancers. Therefore, blockade of the IL-6 signalling pathway has become a target for the therapy of diverse cancers such as multicentric Castleman's disease (CD), multiple myeloma and solid tumours including renal, prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancers. Monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 (Siltuximab) and the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) (Tocilizumab) have emerged as potential immunotherapies, alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy. Human trials have demonstrated the ability to block IL-6 activity and in multicentric CD lead to durable clinical response and longer disease stabilisation. However, the efficacy of these treatments is still debatable for other cancers. New generation therapeutics in development such as Clazakizumab, Sarilumab, and soluble gp130-Fc have the additional features of improved binding affinity, better specificity with reduced adverse effects. A deeper understanding of the immunological basis of these agents, as well as of the challenges that are faced by immunotherapy-based products in clinical trials, will help select the most promising anti-IL-6/IL-6R therapies for large scale use. Concurrently, current research efforts to personalize treatments may help in the treatment of patients that would greatly benefit from IL-6 blocking therapies. Journal: Current medicinal chemistry.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Next-generation immunotherapy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: Strategies to achieve sustained MRD negativity.. Abstract: This study critically examines the evolving landscape of Multiple Myeloma (MM) treatment, spotlighting the shift towards immunotherapeutic strategies in combating this complex hematological malignancy. Despite the clinical challenges posed by MM, including its high relapse and progression rates, recent therapeutic innovations have ushered in a new era of treatment possibilities. The advent of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, and more recently BCMA\u2011targeted immunotherapies such as CAR\u2011T cells and bispecific antibodies, has broadened therapeutic options in multiple myeloma. These modalities show significant potential to achieve sustained minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity and improve patient outcomes. Addressing the limitations of conventional therapies, this review highlights the critical need for novel treatment modalities that can provide durable responses and overcome the disease's inherent resistance to treatment. The analysis further explores the impact of immunotherapeutic approaches, particularly for patients with relapsed or refractory MM, while acknowledging the ongoing challenges related to treatment resistance, side effects, and therapy accessibility. Additionally, it advocates for the integration of immunotherapy into earlier treatment protocols and emphasizes the importance of global accessibility to these advanced treatments. Through this exploration, the review aims to contribute to the hematological community's ongoing dialogue and research efforts, striving to refine MM treatment strategies, enhance patient outcomes, and advance towards the ultimate goal of finding a cure for MM.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Managing Hodgkin lymphoma relapsing after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation: a not-so-good cancer after all!. Abstract: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) relapsing after an autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) poses a therapeutic challenge. In this setting, salvage chemotherapy (for example, gemcitabine-based, ifosfamide-containing and others) or immunotherapy (for example, brentuximab vedotin) is essential as a bridging-cytoreduction strategy to an allogeneic HCT. Myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in relapsed HL is associated with high rates of non-relapse mortality. In carefully selected patients with chemosensitive disease, allografting following lower-intensity conditioning regimens can provide durable disease control rates of about 25-35%. Promising early results with haploidentical and umbilical cord transplantation are noteworthy and are expanding this procedure to patients for whom HLA-matched related or unrelated donors are not available. Unfortunately, a significant number of HL patients relapsing after an autologous HCT are not candidates for allografting because of the presence of resistant disease, donor unavailability or comorbidities. Brentuximab vedotin is approved for HL relapsing after a prior autograft. Rituximab and bendamustine are also active in this setting, albeit with short durations of remission. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (for example, panobinostat, mocetinostat), mTOR inhibitors (for example, everolimus) and immunomodulatory agents (lenalidomide) have shown activity in phase II trials, but currently are not approved for this indication. Second autologous HCT are rarely performed but this approach should not be considered standard practice at this time. The need for effective agents for post autograft failures of HL largely remains unmet. Continuous efforts to ensure early referral of such patients for allogeneic HCT or investigational therapies are the key to improving outcomes of this not-so-good lymphoma.

Abstract: Annually, approximately 200 new ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed in Armenia, which is considered an upper-middle-income country. This study aimed to summarize the survival outcomes of patients with relapsed ovarian cancer in Armenia based on the type of recurrence, risk factors, and choice of systemic treatment. This retrospective case-control study included 228 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer from three different institutions. The median age of the patients was 55. The median follow-up times from relapse and primary diagnosis were 21 and 48 months, respectively. The incidence of platinum-sensitive relapse was 81.6% (186), while platinum-resistant relapse was observed in only 18.4% (42) of patients. The median post-progression survival of the platinum-sensitive group compared to the platinum-resistant group was 54 vs. 25 months (<i>p</i> < 0.001), respectively, while the median survival after relapse was 25 vs. 13 months, respectively; three- and five-year post-progression survival rates in these groups were 31.2% vs. 23.8%, and 15.1% vs. 9.5%, respectively (<i>p</i> = 0.113). Overall, despite new therapeutic approaches, ovarian cancer continues to be one of the deadly malignant diseases affecting women, especially in developing countries with a lack of resources, where chemotherapy remains the primary available systemic treatment for the majority of patients. Low survival rates demonstrate the urgent need for more research focused on this group of patients with poor outcomes. Journal: Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.). Year: 2024.

Abstract: The childhood opsoclonus-myoclonus or Kinsbourne syndrome, is a uncommon process, of acute or subacute beginning, which affects infant and children. It's course is characterized by opsoclonus, polimyoclonias and cerebellar ataxia. The disease is frequently associated to neuroblastoma (46%). We present a retrospective study on 9 patients, emphasizing the clinical presentation and the evolution aspects. We found changes in the EEG in three cases. Most surprising is the scarce incidence of neuroblastoma, which has been found only in a one out of nine patients. We found three cases with relapse during the treatment or on withdrawal and one of them relapsed twice again. The evolution has been variable, since 5/9 patient have presented some type of mild or moderate neuro-psychological sequelae. Out of three patient with relapses, two presented permanent neurological sequelae. A patient which suffered three relapses, is also the one which presents more serious sequelae.

Abstract: Identifying suitable deregulated targets in autophagy pathway is essential for developing autophagy modulating cancer therapies. With this aim, we systematically analyzed the expression levels of genes that contribute to the execution of autophagy in 21 cancers. Deregulated genes for 21 cancers were analyzed using the level 3 mRNA data from TCGAbiolinks. A total of 574 autophagy genes were mapped to the deregulated genes across 21 cancers. PPI network, cluster analysis, gene enrichment, gene ontology, KEGG pathway, patient survival, protein expression and cMap analysis were performed. Among the autophagy genes, 260 were upregulated, and 43 were downregulated across pan-cancer. The upregulated autophagy genes - CDKN2A and BIRC5 - were the most frequent signatures in cancers and could be universal cancer biomarkers. Significant involvement of autophagy process was found in 8 cancers (CHOL, HNSC, GBM, KICH, KIRC, KIRP, LIHC and SARC). Fifteen autophagy hub genes (ATP6V0C, BIRC5, HDAC1, IL4, ITGB1, ITGB4, MAPK3, mTOR, cMYC, PTK2, SRC, TCIRG1, TP63, TP73 and ULK1) were found to be linked with patients survival and also expressed in cancer patients tissue samples, making them as potential drug targets for these cancers. The deregulated autophagy genes were further used to identify drugs Losartan, BMS-345541, Embelin, Abexinostat, Panobinostat, Vorinostat, PD-184352, PP-1, XMD-1150, Triplotide, Doxorubicin and Ouabain, which could target one or more autophagy hub genes. Overall, our findings shed light on the most frequent cancer-associated autophagy genes, potential autophagy targets and molecules for cancer treatment. These findings can accelerate autophagy modulation in cancer therapy. Journal: Gene. Year: 2022. Authors: Kondapuram SK, Coumar MS.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Precise metabolic dependencies of cancer through deep learning and validations.. Abstract: Cancer cells exhibit metabolic reprogramming to sustain proliferation, creating metabolic vulnerabilities absent in normal cells. While prior studies identified specific metabolic dependencies, systematic insights remain limited. Here, we build a graph deep learning-based metabolic vulnerability prediction model, \"DeepMeta,\" which can accurately predict the dependent metabolic genes for cancer samples based on transcriptome and metabolic network information. The performance of DeepMeta has been extensively validated with independent datasets. The metabolic vulnerability of \"undruggable\" cancer-driving alterations has been systematically explored using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Notably, CTNNB1 T41A-activating mutations showed experimentally confirmed vulnerability to purine/pyrimidine metabolism inhibition. TCGA patients with the predicted pyrimidine metabolism dependency show a dramatically improved clinical response to chemotherapeutic drugs that block this pyrimidine metabolism pathway. This study systematically uncovers the metabolic dependency of cancer cells and provides metabolic targets for cancers driven by genetic alterations that are originally undruggable on their own.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Treatment of relapsed and refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma.. Abstract: Despite the high first-line cure rates in patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) still 10%-20% of patients suffer from relapsed or refractory disease. High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is standard of care for suitable patients with relapsed or refractory HL and allows for cure in approximately 50%. Due to the poor prognosis of high-risk patients even with HDCT and ASCT, consolidation strategies have been evaluated to improve the cure rates. For patients with recurrence after HDCT and ASCT, treatment is palliative in most cases. The anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin (BV) has been shown to induce high response rates in these patients; however, durable responses were reported in a small percentage of patients only. For carefully selected patients with multiple relapses, dose-reduced allogeneic transplant (RICallo) is a potentially curative option. The role of RICallo will have to be re-evaluated in the era of anti-programmed death-1 (PD1) antibodies. Journal: Seminars in hematology. Year: 2016. Authors: von Tresckow B, Moskowitz CH.

Abstract: The treatment paradigm for advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC) has undergone substantial transformation due to the introduction of effective, novel therapeutic agents. However, outcomes remain poor, and little is known about current treatment approaches and attrition rates for patients with aUC. To delineate evolving treatment patterns and attrition rates in patients with aUC using a US-based patient-level sample. This retrospective cohort study used patient-level data from the nationwide deidentified electronic health record database Flatiron Health, originating from approximately 280 oncology clinics across the US. Patients included in the analysis received treatment for metastatic or local aUC at a participating site from January 1, 2011, to January 31, 2023. Patients receiving treatment for 2 or more different types of cancer or participating in clinical trials were excluded from the analysis. Frequencies and percentages were used to summarize the (1) treatment received in each line (cisplatin-based regimens, carboplatin-based regimens, programmed cell death 1 and/or programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-1/PD-L1] inhibitors, single-agent nonplatinum chemotherapy, enfortumab vedotin, erdafitinib, sacituzumab govitecan, or others) and (2) attrition of patients with each line of therapy, defined as the percentage of patients not progressing to the next line. Of the 12\u202f157 patients within the dataset, 7260 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis (5364 [73.9%] men; median age at the start of first-line treatment, 73 [IQR, 66-80] years). All patients commenced first-line treatment; of these, only 2714 (37.4%) progressed to receive second-line treatment, and 857 (11.8%) advanced to third-line treatment. The primary regimens used as first-line treatment contained carboplatin (2241 [30.9%]), followed by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (2174 [29.9%]). The PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors emerged as the predominant choice in the second- and third-line (1412 of 2714 [52.0%] and 258 of 857 [30.1%], respectively) treatments. From 2019 onward, novel therapeutic agents were increasingly used in second- and third-line treatments, including enfortumab vedotin (219 of 2714 [8.1%] and 159 of 857 [18.6%], respectively), erdafitinib (39 of 2714 [1.4%] and 28 of 857 [3.3%], respectively), and sacituzumab govitecan (14 of 2714 [0.5%] and 34 of 857 [4.0%], respectively). The findings of this cohort study suggest that approximately two-thirds of patients with aUC did not receive second-line treatment. Most first-line treatments do not include cisplatin-based regimens and instead incorporate carboplatin- or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-based therapies. These data warrant the provision of more effective and tolerable first-line treatments for patients with aUC. Journal: JAMA network open. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent gastrointestinal cancer posing significant clinical challenges. CRC management traditionally involves surgery, often coupled with chemotherapy. However, unresectable or metastatic CRC (mCRC) presents a complex challenge necessitating innovative treatment strategies. Targeted therapies have emerged as the cornerstone of treatment in such cases, with interventions tailored to specific molecular attributes. Concurrently, immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer treatment by harnessing the immune system to combat malignant cells. This review explores the evolving landscape of CRC treatment, focusing on the synergy between immunotherapies and targeted therapies, thereby offering new avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of therapy for CRC.

Patients with non-central nervous system solid tumors underwent a combination of whole exome sequencing (WES), whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), and high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis of the tumor, with WES of matched germline DNA. Clinically actionable alterations were identified as a reportable germline mutation, a diagnosis change, or a somatic event (including a single nucleotide variant, an indel, an amplification, a deletion, or a fusion gene), which could be targeted with drugs in existing clinical trials or with FDA-approved drugs. Fifty-nine patients in 20 diagnostic categories were enrolled from 2010 to 2014. Ages ranged from 7 months to 25 years old. Seventy-three percent of the patients had prior chemotherapy, and the tumors from these patients with relapsed or refractory cancers had a higher mutational burden than that reported in the literature. Thirty patients (51% of total) had clinically actionable mutations, of which 24 (41%) had a mutation that was currently targetable in a clinical trial setting, 4 patients (7%) had a change in diagnosis, and 7 patients (12%) had a reportable germline mutation. We found a remarkably high number of clinically actionable mutations in 51% of the patients, and 12% with significant germline mutations. We demonstrated the clinical feasibility of next-generation sequencing in a diverse population of relapsed and refractory pediatric solid tumors. Clin Cancer Res; 22(15); 3810-20. \u00a92016 AACR.

Abstract: Gastric cancer predominantly adenocarcinoma, accounts for over 85% of gastric cancer diagnoses. Current therapeutic options are limited, necessitating the discovery of novel drug targets and effective treatments. The Affymetrix gene expression microarray dataset (GSE64951) was retrieved from NCBI-GEO data normalization and DEGs identification was done by using R-Bioconductor package. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of DEGs was performed using DAVID. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed by STRING database plugin in Cytoscape. Subclusters/modules of important interacting genes in main network were extracted by using MCODE. The hub genes from in the network were identified by using Cytohubba. The miRNet tool built a hub gene/mRNA-miRNA network and Kaplan-Meier-Plotter conducted survival analysis. AutoDock Vina and GROMACS MD simulations were used for docking and stability analysis of marine compounds against the 5CNN protein. Total 734 DEGs (507 up-regulated and 228 down-regulated) were identified. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in processes like cell-cell adhesion and ATP binding. Eight hub genes (EGFR, HSPA90AA1, MAPK1, HSPA4, PPP2CA, CDKN2A, CDC20, and ATM) were selected for further analysis. A total of 23 miRNAs associated with hub genes were identified, with 12 of them targeting PPP2CA. EGFR displayed the highest expression and hazard rate in survival analyses. The kinase domain of EGFR (PDBID: 5CNN) was chosen as the drug target. Adociaquinone A from Petrosia alfiani, docked with 5CNN, showed the lowest binding energy with stable interactions across a 50\u2009ns MD simulation, highlighting its potential as a lead molecule against EGFR. This study has identified crucial DEGs and hub genes in gastric cancer, proposing novel therapeutic targets. Specifically, Adociaquinone A demonstrates promising potential as a bioactive drug against EGFR in gastric cancer, warranting further investigation. The predicted miRNA against the hub gene/proteins can also be used as potential therapeutic targets. Journal: Journal of cellular and molecular medicine. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Promoter methylation in various tumor suppressor genes is reported to influence gallbladder carcinogenesis. Here, we aimed to identify methylation status in gallbladder cancer (GBC) by performing a comprehensive genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. The methylation status of 485,577 CpG sites were investigated using Illumina's Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip array in 24 tissues (eight each of tumor, adjacent non-tumor, and gallstone). About 33,443 differentially methylated sites (DMRs) were obtained in the whole human genome, of which 24,188 (72\u00a0%) were hypermethylated and 9255 (28\u00a0%) were hypomethylated. The data also revealed that majority of the DMRs are localized on the proximal promoter region [Transcription start sites (TSS200, TSS1500) and 5' untranslated region (5'UTR)] and first exon. Exclusion of first exon detected a total of 10,123 (79\u00a0%) hypermethylated and 2703 (21\u00a0%) hypomethylated sites. Comparative analysis of the later\u00a0with our differential proteomics data resulted in\u00a0identification of 7 hypermethylated or down-regulated (e.g., FBN1, LPP, and SOD3) and 61 hypomethylated or up-regulated markers (e.g., HBE1, SNRPF, TPD52) for GBC. These genes could be further validated on the basis of their methylation/expression status in order to identify their utility to be used as biomarker/s for early diagnosis\u00a0and management of GBC.

Abstract: Outcomes for relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have not been documented in resource-limited settings. This study examined survival after relapse for children with ALL in Central America. A retrospective cohort study was performed and included children with first relapse of ALL in Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador between 1990 and 2011. Predictors of subsequent event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined. There were 755 children identified with relapsed disease. The median time from diagnosis to relapse was 1.7 years (interquartile range, 0.8-3.1 years). Most relapses occurred during (53.9%) or following (24.9%) maintenance chemotherapy, and the majority occurred in the bone marrow (63.1%). Following the initial relapse, subsequent 3-year EFS (\u00b1 standard error) and OS were 22.0% \u00b1 1.7%, and 28.2% \u00b1 1.9%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, worse postrelapse survival was associated with age \u2265 10 years, white blood cell count \u2265 50 \u00d7 10(9) /L, and positive central nervous system status at the original ALL diagnosis, relapse that was not isolated central nervous system or testicular, and relapse < 36 months following diagnosis. Site and time to relapse were used to identify a favorable risk group whose 3-year EFS and OS were 50.0% \u00b1 8.9% and 68.0% \u00b1 8.1%, respectively. Prognosis after relapsed ALL in Central America is poor, but a substantial number of those with favorable risk features have prolonged survival, despite lack of access to stem cell transplantation. Stratification by risk factors can guide therapeutic decision-making. Cancer 2013. \u00a9 2012 American Cancer Society. Journal: Cancer. Year: 2013.

Abstract: Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) with arsenic trioxide (ATO) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is highly effective first-line therapy, although approximately 5-10% of patients relapse. Tamibarotene is a synthetic retinoid with activity in APL patients who relapse after chemotherapy and ATRA, but has not been studied in relapse after treatment with ATO and ATRA. We report on a phase II study of tamibarotene in adult patients with relapsed or refractory APL after treatment with ATRA and ATO (n\u00a0=\u00a014). Participants were treated with tamibarotene (6\u00a0mg/m(2) /d) during induction and for up to six cycles of consolidation. The overall response rate was 64% (n\u00a0=\u00a09), the rate of complete cytogenetic response was 43% (n\u00a0=\u00a06) and the rate of complete molecular response was 21% (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Relapse was frequent\u00a0with 7 of 9 responders relapsing after a median of 4\u00b76\u00a0months (range 1\u00b76-26\u00b78\u00a0months). The median event-free survival (EFS) was 3\u00b75\u00a0months [95% confidence interval (CI) 0-8\u00b76\u00a0months] and the median overall survival (OS) was 9\u00b75\u00a0months (95% CI 5\u00b79-13\u00b71\u00a0months). These results demonstrate that tamibarotene has activity in relapsed APL after treatment with ATO and ATRA and further studies using tamibarotene as initial therapy and in combination with ATO are warranted.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Steroid receptor coactivator-3 as a potential molecular target for cancer therapy.. Abstract: Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), also called amplified-in-breast cancer-1 (AIB1), is an oncogenic coactivator in endocrine and non-endocrine cancers. Functional studies demonstrate SRC-3 promotes numerous aspects of cancer, through its capacity as a coactivator for nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors, and via its ability to control multiple growth pathways simultaneously. Targeting SRC-3 with specific inhibitors therefore holds future promise for clinical cancer therapy. We discuss critical advances in understanding SRC-3 as a cancer mediator and prospective drug target. We review SRC-3 structure and function and its role in distinct aspects of cancer. In addition, we discuss SRC-3 regulation and degradation. Finally, we comment on a recently discovered SRC-3 small molecular inhibitor. Most targeted chemotherapeutic drugs block only a single cellular pathway. In response, cancers frequently acquire resistance by upregulating alternative pathways. SRC-3 coordinates multiple signaling networks, suggesting SRC-3 inhibition offers a promising therapeutic strategy. Development of an effective SRC-3 inhibitor faces critical challenges. Better understanding of SRC-3 function and interacting partners, in both the nucleus and cytosol, is required for optimized inhibitor development. Ultimately, blockade of SRC-3 oncogenic function may inhibit multiple cancer-related signaling pathways. Journal: Expert opinion on therapeutic targets. Year: 2012. Authors: Tien JC, Xu J.

Abstract: Cancer is a complex category of diseases caused in large part by genetic or genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic or epigenomic alterations in affected cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Carcinogenesis reflects the clonal expansion of cells that progressively acquire these genetic and epigenetic alterations-changes that, in turn, lead to modifications at the RNA level. Gradually advancing technology and most recently, the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), combined with bioinformatics analytic tools, have revolutionized our ability to interrogate cancer cells. The ultimate goal is to apply these high-throughput technologies to the various aspects of clinical cancer care: cancer-risk assessment, diagnosis, as well as target identification for treatment and prevention. In this article, we emphasize how the knowledge gained through large-scale omics-oriented approaches, with a focus on variations at the level of nucleic acids, can inform the field of chemoprevention.

Chromosome abnormalities include highly aberrant structures, particularly chromothriptic chromosomes. The generation of massive sequencing data has illuminated the scope of the mutational burden in cancer genomes, identifying patterns of mutations (mutation signatures), which have the potential to shed light on the relatedness and etiologies of cancers and impact therapy response. Some mutation patterns are clearly attributable to disruptions in pathways that maintain genomic integrity.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Management of relapsing disease in prostate cancer.. Abstract: Almost all patients with prostatic cancer will eventually escape the control of the first-line endocrine therapy and relapse. This escape is attributed to selecting and/or cloning preexisting or de novo appearing hormone-independent or resistant cell lines and occurs in most patients after a median time of 12 to 18 months. Currently, there are no generally accepted rules for second-line management, either endocrine or by other means. It seems reasonable to consider length of survival as the only objective response criterion and not to rely on other response criteria. Available second-line therapeutic modalities in relapsed prostatic cancer are alternative endocrine manipulations, chemotherapy, combined endocrine and cytotoxic therapy, new drugs, radiation therapy, and general antitumoral and supportive care. Second-line therapy in relapsed disease makes sense if life can be prolonged while relieving symptoms and maintaining or improving the quality of survival. The capacity to prolong survival is limited. As a result, second-line therapy should aim more at improving the quality rather than the length of survival while considering the specific expectations and wishes of the patient. Journal: Cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Emerging IO checkpoints in gastrointestinal oncology.. Abstract: Recent progress in immunotherapy has significantly altered the therapeutic approach for gastrointestinal cancers, which are historically challenging due to their intricate pathologies and unfavorable outcomes. This review emphasizes the growing importance of immune checkpoints like TIGIT, VISTA, GITR, STING, and TIM-3 in the treatment of gastrointestinal oncology. These checkpoints are crucial elements within the tumor microenvironment, presenting new therapeutic possibilities. Studies show that TIGIT and GITR regulate the functions of T cells and NK cells, while the VISTA and STING pathways boost the body's anti-tumor responses. TIM-3 is linked with T cell fatigue, highlighting its potential as a target to counteract immune evasion mechanisms. Integrating these immune checkpoints with traditional treatments could result in more customized and effective therapeutic approaches. This detailed review seeks to explore the changing field of immune checkpoint research, offering insights from molecular biology to clinical practice, and envisioning a future where advanced treatment methods greatly enhance patient outcomes in GI cancers.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Multi-targeted HDAC Inhibitors as Anticancer Agents: Current Status and Future Prospective.. Abstract: Multi-targeted agents can interact with multiple targets sequentially, resulting in synergistic and more effective therapies for several complicated disorders, including cancer, even with relatively modest activity. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are low molecular weight small compounds that increase the acetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins, altering gene expression and thereby impacting angiogenesis, metastasis, and apoptosis, among other processes. The HDAC inhibitors affect multiple cellular pathways thus producing adverse issues, causing therapeutic resistance, and they have poor pharmacokinetic properties. The designing of HDAC-based dual/multi-target inhibitor is an important strategy to overcome adverse effects, drug resistance and increase the effectiveness in controlling cancer. The selection of target combinations to design multitarget HDAC inhibitor is generally accomplished on the basis of systematic highthroughput screening (HTS), network pharmacology analysis methods. The identification of the pharmacophore against individual targets is performed using rational or computation methods. The identified pharmacophore can combine with merged, fused, or linked with the cleavable or non-cleavable linker to retain the interaction with the original target while being compatible with the other target. The objective of this review is to elucidate the potential targets' design strategies, biological activity, and the recent development of dual/multi-targeting HDAC inhibitors as potential anticancer agents. This review elucidates the designing strategies of the potential target along with biological activity and the recent development of dual/multi-targeting HDAC inhibitors as potential anticancer agents. The development of HDAC-based dual/multi-target inhibitors is important for overcoming side effects, drug resistance, and effective cancer control. Journal: Current medicinal chemistry. Year: 2023.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Outcomes of Refractory and Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma With Autologous Stem-Cell Transplantation: A Single Institution Experience.. Abstract: Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults. Overall survival is approximately 80% to 90%. A subset of these patients has refractory disease or experience disease relapse. Conventional salvage therapies and autologous stem-cell transplantation is usually considered the standard of care for these patients. Our analysis reports outcomes in these patients. After institutional review board approval, a retrospective analysis of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who were up to 18 years of age and who had refractory or relapsed disease at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre from September 2009 to December 2013 was performed. Patients who underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem-cell rescue were included in this analysis. A total of 567 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma registered at the hospital. Sixty of the patients (10.6%) had either primary progressive or refractory disease or relapse after finishing with first-line chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell was administered to 25 of these patients (42%). Thirteen patients (40%) had progressive disease (PD), five (22%) had early relapse, and seven (38%) had late relapse. A number of salvage regimens were used, including etoposide, prednisolone, ifosfamide, and cisplatin; dexamethasone, cytarabine, and carboplatin; and gemcitabine plus vinorelbine. Re-evaluation was performed before taking patients to a high dose, and it showed complete response in 17 patients (68%), partial response in six patients (24%), and PD in two patients (8%). Twenty-one patients (84%) are in remission after transplantation, with two patients (8%) having died as a result of disease progression and two patients (2%) having relapsed after treatment. Overall survival is 92% at 4 years, with event-free survival of 80% at 4 years. Our retrospective analysis shows good outcomes in patients who had PD or refractory disease. Disease response before transplantation is important in predicting outcomes. Journal: Journal of global oncology. Year: 2019. Authors: Wali R, Saeed H, Patrus N, Javed S, Khan SJ.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Identification and clinical validation of a multigene assay that interrogates the biology of cancer stem cells and predicts metastasis in breast cancer: A retrospective consecutive study.. Abstract: Breast cancers show variations in the number and biological aggressiveness of cancer stem cells that correlate with their clinico-prognostic and molecular heterogeneity. Thus, prognostic stratification of breast cancers based on cancer stem cells might help guide patient management. We derived a 20-gene stem cell signature from the transcriptional profile of normal mammary stem cells, capable of identifying breast cancers with a homogeneous profile and poor prognosis in in silico analyses. The clinical value of this signature was assessed in a prospective-retrospective cohort of 2, 453 breast cancer patients. Models for predicting individual risk of metastasis were developed from expression data of the 20 genes in patients randomly assigned to a training set, using the ridge-penalized Cox regression, and tested in an independent validation set. Analyses revealed that the 20-gene stem cell signature provided prognostic information in Triple-Negative and Luminal breast cancer patients, independently of standard clinicopathological parameters. Through functional studies in individual tumours, we correlated the risk score assigned by the signature with the proliferative and self-renewal potential of the cancer stem cell population. By retraining the 20-gene signature in Luminal patients, we derived the risk model, StemPrintER, which predicted early and late recurrence independently of standard prognostic factors. Our findings indicate that the 20-gene stem cell signature, by its unique ability to interrogate the biology of cancer stem cells of the primary tumour, provides a reliable estimate of metastatic risk in Triple-Negative and Luminal breast cancer patients independently of standard clinicopathological parameters.

This method uses complementary DNA (cDNA) to generate several millions of short sequence reads that are aligned to a reference genome allowing the comprehensive characterization of the transcripts in a cell. RNA-Seq has a wide variety of applications which lead to a pervasive adoption of this method well beyond the genomics community and a deployment of this technique as a standard part of the toolkit applied in life sciences.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Anti-HDGF targets cancer and cancer stromal stem cells resistant to chemotherapy.. Abstract: Approximately one third of the patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) will initially respond to platinum-based chemotherapy, but virtually all tumors will progress (acquired resistance). The remainder will progress during initial treatment (primary resistance). In this study, we test whether the treatment can be improved by inhibiting hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF). Thirteen primary NSCLC heterotransplant models were used to test four treatment regimens, including platinum-based chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab (VEGF-neutralizing antibody) or HDGF-H3 (HDGF-neutralizing antibody) and chemotherapy with bevacizumab and HDGF-H3. Expression of stem cell-related genes was measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Among 13 primary NSCLC heterotransplant models, three (23%) responded to chemotherapy but all relapsed within 20 days. The residual tumors after response to the chemotherapy exhibited an increased expression in 51 (61%) of 84 genes related with stem cell proliferation and maintenance, particularly those in Notch and Wnt pathways, suggesting enrichment for stem cell populations in the residual tumors. Interestingly, tumors from two of three models treated with HDGF-H3, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy combination did not relapse during 6 months of posttreatment observation. Importantly, this treatment combination substantially downregulated expression levels in 57 (68%) of 84 stem cell-related genes, including 34 (67%) of 51 genes upregulated after the chemotherapy. These data support the hypothesis that cancer stem cells (CSC) are a mechanism for chemotherapy resistance and suggest HDGF may be a target for repressing CSCs to prevent relapse of NSCLC sensitive to chemotherapy.

Abstract: Few prospective studies about the management of unilateral retinoblastoma with pathology risk factors (PRFs) have been published. Patients (n = 114) were divided into four groups: Group 1 (initial chemoreduction) (n = 17). Groups 2 and 3, included patients initially enucleated with no, or lower risk PRFs: (n = 65) and with higher risk PRFs (n = 30), respectively. The later included postlaminar optic nerve involvement (PLONI) (n = 23), tumor at resection margin of optic nerve (n = 5) or isolated scleral invasion (n = 2). Group 3 received adjuvant chemotherapy including a total eight cycles of carboplatin and etoposide, alternating with cyclophosphamide, idarubicin, and vincristine. Orbital radiotherapy (45 Gy) was given to patients with invasion to the resection margin. Group 4 included patients with metastatic disease (n = 2). They were given neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery and high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue. Five-year event-free survival is 0.94 (1 for Group 1, 0.94 for Group 2, 0.96 for Group 3, and 0 for Group 4). Events included. Group 2: Systemic relapse (n = 2) and combined orbital and CNS relapse (n = 1). Relapsing patients had PLONI (n = 2) and isolated focal choroidal invasion (n = 1). Group 3: CNS relapse (n = 1) in a patient with tumor at the resection margin of optic nerve. Group 4: CNS relapse (n = 2). Only one relapsed patient survived. Eight of 17 eyes treated conservatively were preserved. The survival of patients with unilateral retinoblastoma was excellent and 60% were spared from adjuvant treatment. Our intensive regimen was likely to be effective for prevention of metastasis in patients with higher risk PRFs. Journal: Pediatric blood & cancer. Year: 2010.

Abstract: Cancer is a leading cause of death in developed countries, despite many breakthroughs in targeted small molecule and immunotherapeutic interventions. A deeper understanding of the characteristics and processes that underlie malignancy will enable us to develop more effective therapeutic options to improve patient outcomes. One particular area of interest is in cancer cell metabolism. Even as early as the 1920s, Otto Warburg recognized dysregulated metabolism in cancerous cells. Altered metabolism may provide targetable nutrient dependencies for further clinical development, either by nutrient restriction or pathway inhibition. More recently, researchers have observed an increasingly strong linkage between altered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and tumor cell metabolism, with strong implications for therapeutic targeting. In this review, we summarize the literature surrounding mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, metabolism, and cancer, as well as providing a discussion of the potential for mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> modulation as an anticancer therapeutic modality.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Notch signaling pathway: architecture, disease, and therapeutics.. Abstract: The NOTCH gene was identified approximately 110 years ago. Classical studies have revealed that NOTCH signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway. NOTCH receptors undergo three cleavages and translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes. NOTCH signaling deeply participates in the development and homeostasis of multiple tissues and organs, the aberration of which results in cancerous and noncancerous diseases. However, recent studies indicate that the outcomes of NOTCH signaling are changeable and highly dependent on context. In terms of cancers, NOTCH signaling can both promote and inhibit tumor development in various types of cancer. The overall performance of NOTCH-targeted therapies in clinical trials has failed to meet expectations. Additionally, NOTCH mutation has been proposed as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade therapy in many cancers. Collectively, the NOTCH pathway needs to be integrally assessed with new perspectives to inspire discoveries and applications. In this review, we focus on both classical and the latest findings related to NOTCH signaling to illustrate the history, architecture, regulatory mechanisms, contributions to physiological development, related diseases, and therapeutic applications of the NOTCH pathway. The contributions of NOTCH signaling to the tumor immune microenvironment and cancer immunotherapy are also highlighted. We hope this review will help not only beginners but also experts to systematically and thoroughly understand the NOTCH signaling pathway. Journal: Signal transduction and targeted therapy.

Abstract: Most patients with advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) ultimately relapse after platinum-based chemotherapy. Combining bevacizumab, olaparib, and durvalumab likely drives synergistic activity. This open-label phase 2 study (NCT04015739) aimed to assess activity and safety of this triple combination in female patients with relapsed high-grade AOC following prior platinum-based therapy. Patients were treated with olaparib (300\u2009mg orally, twice daily), the bevacizumab biosimilar FKB238 (15\u2009mg/kg intravenously, once-every-3-weeks), and durvalumab (1.12\u2009g intravenously, once-every-3-weeks) in nine French centers. The primary endpoint was the non-progression rate at 3 months for platinum-resistant relapse or 6 months for platinum-sensitive relapse per RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST. Secondary endpoints were CA-125 decline with CA-125 ELIMination rate constant K (KELIM-B) per CA-125 longitudinal kinetics over 100 days, progression free survival and overall survival, tumor response, and safety. Non-progression rates were 69.8% (90%CI 55.9%-80.0%) at 3 months for platinum-resistant relapse patients (N\u2009=\u200941), meeting the prespecified endpoint, and 43.8% (90%CI 29.0%-57.4%) at 6 months for platinum-sensitive relapse (N\u2009=\u200933), not meeting the prespecified endpoint. Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95%CI 3.5-5.9) and 4.9 months (95%CI 2.9-7.0) respectively. Favorable KELIM-B was associated with better survival. No toxic deaths or major safety signals were observed. Here we show that further investigation of this triple combination may be considered in AOC patients with platinum-resistant relapse.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: 2nd Gordon Hamilton Fairley lecture. Need for new approaches to the treatment of patients in clinical remission, with special reference to acute myeloid leukaemia.. Abstract: A serious limitation of chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), Hodgkins disease and some classes of breast cancer is that, even when clinically evident disease responds well, the same chemotherapy when given during remission does not affect the rate of relapse after chemotherapeutic or surgical ablation of the primary disease. This cannot, in general, be caused by genetic adaptation of the residual cancer cells which renders them resistant to specific drugs, because after relapse further remissions can be obtained with the same drugs that were ineffective by chronic administration in prolonging remission. The resistance of the residual cells may arise from mechanisms such as inaccessibility for anatomical or other reasons, or because of a change in metabolic state which causes these cells temporarily to cease division, when they cannot be harmed by cycle-dependent drugs and repair damage sustained from cycle-independent drugs. Limited differentiation has been shown capable of reversal and this may be a mechanism which leads to quiescence and associated \"resistance\", particularly in the case of AML. Where such resistance occurs treatment during remission-or as an adjuvant to surgery and radiotherapy-may have to rely on mechanisms which are independent of cellular proliferation such as processes associated with graft-versus-host-disease or the induction of terminal differentiation. A model for studying the nature of resistance of residual cancer and for testing treatments that might be active against cancer cells in this state may be dormant metastases. The latter are malignant cells which appear to be in peaceful co-existence with their host and which in experimental systems have been induced to grow into lethal metastases by perturbation of the host by surgical trauma, by hormonal manipulation or by immunosuppression.

Abstract: The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is a complex network linking extracellular stimuli to cell survival and proliferation. Cytoplasmic signaling to activate NF-\u03baB can occur as part of the DNA damage response or in response to a large variety of activators, including viruses, inflammation, and cell death. NF-\u03baB transcription factors play a fundamental role in tumorigenesis and are implicated in the origination and propagation of both hematologic and solid tumor types, including melanoma, breast, prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, colon, lung, and thyroid cancers. On the other hand, NF-\u03baB signaling is key to immune function and is likely necessary for antitumor immunity. This presents a dilemma when designing therapeutic approaches to target NF-\u03baB. There is growing interest in identifying novel modulators to inhibit NF-\u03baB activity as impeding different steps of the NF-\u03baB pathway has potential to slow tumor growth, progression, and resistance to chemotherapy. Despite significant advances in our understanding of this pathway, our ability to effectively clinically block key targets for cancer therapy remains limited due to on-target effects in normal tissues. Tumor specificity is critical to developing therapeutic strategies targeting this antiapoptotic signaling pathway to maintain antitumor immune surveillance when applying such therapy to patients.

Abstract: This paper discusses selected activities, issues, and challenges in recent development of analytical methods and applications in biomarker identification and validation using state-of-the-art genomic approaches. Molecular profiling via genomics, proteomics, and metabonomics has opened new windows to study disease states and biological systems. It has also provided exciting opportunities for novel applications in clinical research as well as in drug discovery and development. In the past several years, we have witnessed enormous progress resulting particularly from gene expression profiling of mRNA or transcriptomics. After a brief review on technology advances in gene expression profiling using microarrays, I mainly discuss recent developments of the genomic approaches to biomarker identification and validation in two major types of applications. The first type involves examples in cancer diagnostics and prognostics based on tumor gene expression profiling, whereas the second type involves biomarker applications in drug discovery and development. The focus will be on analytical methods and algorithms that have been developed in recent years facilitating biomarker discovery and application by leveraging genome-wide expression profiles derived from microarrays. Technical issues in experimental design, data processing, error modeling, quality control, figures of merit for performance evaluation, and meta-analysis related to biomarker discovery and application are also discussed.

Abstract: The expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (TC) is used as an immunotherapy biomarker in lung cancer, but heterogeneous intratumoral expression is often observed. To better understand heterogeneity in the lung cancer tumor microenvironment, we performed proteomic and whole-transcriptomic digital spatial profiling analyses of TCs and immune cells (IC) in spatially matched areas based on tumor PD-L1 expression and the status of the immune microenvironment. We validated our findings using IHC, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and immunotherapy cohorts. ICs in areas with high PD-L1 expression on TCs showed more features, indicative of immunosuppression and exhaustion, than ICs in areas with low PD-L1 expression on TCs. TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-inflamed areas showed upregulation of proinflammatory processes, whereas TCs highly expressing PD-L1 within immune-deficient areas showed upregulation of various metabolic processes. Using differentially expressed genes of TCs between the immune-inflamed and immune-deficient areas, we identified a prognostic gene signature for lung cancer. In addition, we found that a high ratio of CD8+ cells to M2 macrophages predicted favorable outcomes in patients with PD-L1-expressing lung cancer after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Overall, this study demonstrates that TCs and ICs have distinct spatial features within the lung tumor microenvironment that are related to tumor PD-L1 expression and IC infiltration.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men and 2nd leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the backbone of treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Over the past several decades a number of new therapeutics, such as novel androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, targeted agents and radionuclide therapies, have been introduced for the treatment of prostate cancers. These agents have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes of prostate cancer patients in randomized clinical trials. In addition, new therapeutic strategies, such as early intensification of ADT, novel treatment combinations, and treatment sequencing, are expected to improve outcomes further. In this clinical review, we discuss the changing treatment landscape for advanced prostate cancer with a focus on new therapeutics. Journal: Advances in cancer research. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Unraveling the protein interaction wiring that occurs in human cells as a scaffold of biological processes requires the identification of all elements that constitute such molecular interaction networks. Proteome-wide experimental studies and bioinformatic comprehensive efforts have provided reliable and updated compendiums of the human protein interactome. In this work, we present a current view of available databases of human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that allow building protein interaction networks. We also investigate human proteins as targets of specific drugs to analyze how chemicals interact with different target proteins, placing also the study in a network relational space. Hence, we undertake a description of several major drug-target resources to provide a present perspective of the associations between human proteins and specific chemicals. The identification of molecular targets for specific drugs is a critical step to improve disease therapy. As different diseases have different biomolecular scenarios, we addressed the identification of drug-targeted genes focusing our investigations on cancer and cancer genes. So, a description of resources that provide curated compendiums of human cancer genes is presented. Cancer is a complex disease where multiple genetic changes rewire cellular networks during carcinogenesis. This indicates that cancer drug therapy needs the implementation of network-driven studies to reveal multiplex interactions between cancer genes and drugs. To make progress in this direction, in the last part of this work we provide a bipartite network of cancer genes and their drugs shown in a graph landscape that disclose the existence of specific drug-target modules.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Genetic Ancestry Inference from Cancer-Derived Molecular Data across Genomic and Transcriptomic Platforms.. Abstract: Genetic ancestry-oriented cancer research requires the ability to perform accurate and robust genetic ancestry inference from existing cancer-derived data, including whole-exome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and targeted gene panels, very often in the absence of matching cancer-free genomic data. Here we examined the feasibility and accuracy of computational inference of genetic ancestry relying exclusively on cancer-derived data. A data synthesis framework was developed to optimize and assess the performance of the ancestry inference for any given input cancer-derived molecular profile. In its core procedure, the ancestral background of the profiled patient is replaced with one of any number of individuals with known ancestry. The data synthesis framework is applicable to multiple profiling platforms, making it possible to assess the performance of inference specifically for a given molecular profile and separately for each continental-level ancestry; this ability extends to all ancestries, including those without statistically sufficient representation in the existing cancer data. The inference procedure was demonstrated to be accurate and robust in a wide range of sequencing depths. Testing of the approach in four representative cancer types and across three molecular profiling modalities showed that continental-level ancestry of patients can be inferred with high accuracy, as quantified by its agreement with the gold standard of deriving ancestry from matching cancer-free molecular data. This study demonstrates that vast amounts of existing cancer-derived molecular data are potentially amenable to ancestry-oriented studies of the disease without requiring matching cancer-free genomes or patient self-reported ancestry. The development of a computational approach that enables accurate and robust ancestry inference from cancer-derived molecular profiles without matching cancer-free data provides a valuable methodology for genetic ancestry-oriented cancer research.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Wanna Get Away? Maintenance Treatments and Chemotherapy Holidays in Gynecologic Cancers.. Abstract: Epithelial ovarian cancer has a very high rate of relapse after primary therapy; historically approximately 70% of patients with a complete clinical response to surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy will relapse and die of the disease. Although this number has slowly improved, cure rates remain less than 50%. As such, maintenance therapy with the aim of preventing or delaying disease relapse and the goal of improving overall survival has been the subject of intense study. Numerous earlier studies with agents ranging from radioactive phosphorus to extended frontline therapy or to monthly taxol administration demonstrated encouraging improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) only to find, disappointingly, no benefit in overall survival. In addition, the PFS advantage of maintenance therapy was associated with disconcerting side effects such that maintenance therapy was not adapted as standard of care. Studies with bevacizumab and PARP inhibitors have demonstrated a PFS advantage with a manageable side-effect profile. However, an overall survival advantage remains unclear, and the use of these approaches thus remains controversial. Furthermore, in recurrent disease, the length of chemotherapy and benefits of extended chemotherapy is unclear. Thus, additional trials assessing maintenance strategies in ovarian and other gynecologic malignancies are needed. Journal: American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Abstract: Endometrial cancer currently represents the most frequent gynecologic malignancy in Western countries, and the seventh most common cancer in women. For advanced-stage disease, the recurrence risk is high, and the site of the relapse is heterogeneous with localized or spread peritoneal disease. There are few therapeutic strategies, and the quality of life is poor. We present 3 cases of peritoneal-spread recurrences of endometrial cancer in patients with advanced stage at diagnosis. The patients had been subjected to multiple lines of chemotherapy including re-challenging with platinum regimens, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, and taxane, with progression of disease. These patients came to us with abdominal distension, dyspnea, elevated CA 125, and presence of ascites. After paracentesis with a single administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy based on carboplatin, all 3 patients showed improvement in their quality of life and breathing as well as reduction of fatigue and anorexia. No complications occurred. Although only 3 cases are reported, the exceptional results and the absence of side effects observed strongly warrant future trials to investigate the role intraperitoneal chemotherapy can have both as palliative treatment of refractory ascites and as salvage therapy in advanced endometrial cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Unveiling the connection: Long-chain non-coding RNAs and critical signaling pathways in breast cancer.. Abstract: Breast cancer is a complex and diverse condition that disrupts multiple signaling pathways essential for cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Recently, the significant involvement of long-chain non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in controlling key signaling pathways associated with breast cancer development has been discovered. This review aims to explore the interaction between lncRNAs and various pathways, including the AKT/PI3K/mTOR, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Notch, DNA damage response, TGF-\u03b2, Hedgehog, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, to gain a comprehensive understanding of their roles in breast cancer. The AKT/PI3K/mTOR pathway regulates cell growth, survival, and metabolic function. Recent data suggests that specific lncRNAs can influence the functioning of this pathway, acting as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Dysregulation of this pathway is commonly observed in breast cancer cases. Moreover, breast cancer development has been associated with other pathways such as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Notch, TGF-\u03b2, Hedgehog, and NF-\u03baB. Emerging studies have identified lncRNAs that modulate breast cancer's growth, progression, and metastasis by interacting with these pathways. To advance the development of innovative diagnostic tools and targeted treatment options, it is crucial to comprehend the intricate relationship between lncRNAs and vital signaling pathways in breast cancer. By fully harnessing the therapeutic potential of lncRNAs, there is a possibility of developing more effective and personalized therapy choices for breast cancer patients. Further investigation is necessary to comprehensively understand the role of lncRNAs within breast cancer signaling pathways and fully exploit their therapeutic potential.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The coming decade in precision oncology: six riddles.. Abstract: High-throughput methods to investigate tumour omic landscapes have quickly catapulted cancer specialists into the precision oncology era. The singular lesson of precision oncology might be that, for it to be precise, treatment must be personalized, as each cancer's complex molecular and immune landscape differs from patient to patient. Transformative therapies include those that are targeted at the sequelae of molecular abnormalities or at immune mechanisms, and, increasingly, pathways previously thought to be undruggable have become druggable. Critical to applying precision medicine is the concept that the right combination of drugs must be chosen for each patient and used at the right stage of the disease. Multiple puzzles remain that complicate therapy choice, including evidence that deleterious mutations are common in normal tissues and non-malignant conditions. The host's role is also likely to be key in determining treatment response, especially for immunotherapy. Indeed, maximizing the impact of immunotherapy will require omic analyses to match the right immune-targeted drugs to the individualized patient and tumour setting. In this Perspective, we discuss six key riddles that must be solved to optimize the application of precision oncology to otherwise lethal malignancies. Journal: Nature reviews. Cancer. Year: 2023.

Abstract: Therapy results in childhood acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) differ from those of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cellular drug resistance might be one of the reasons of therapy failure in AML. The aim of the study was the analysis of ex vivo drug resistance profile in childhood initial and relapsed AML in comparison to initial ALL. Fifty-three AML samples were tested for chemosensitivity and results were compared with those of 106 initial ALL samples. Ex vivo drug resistance was tested by means of the MTT assay. Up to 29 cytotoxic drugs were tested for each patient. When compared to de nova ALL samples, myeloblasts from initial AML samples were significantly more resistant to most tested drugs, except cytarabine, mercaptopurine and thioguanine. Relapsed AML samples, in relation to initial AML samples, showed comparable sensitivity to cytarabine, idarubicin, fludarabine and cladribine. Patients, who have died due to refractory or relapsing disease, were already on first diagnosis 2-fold more resistant to cytarabine, 6.4-fold more resistant to cisplatin and 3-fold more resistant to carboplatin, when compared to those who stay in remission. Resistance to prednisolone was observed in 85% initial and all relapsed AML samples, in comparison to 33% of ALL samples. Resistance to cytarabine occurred in 2.1% of ALL and 12% of AML cases while a patient with Down syndrome presented the most sensitive drug resistance profile. In conclusion this study shows that no drug was found which, on average, was more effective in AML than in ALL samples. The sensitivity of myeloblasts to platinum derivatives might have prognostic value. Journal: Leukemia & lymphoma. Year: 2002. Authors: Styczynski J, Wysocki M, Debski R, Juraszewska E, Malinowska I.

Therapeutic interventions based on adaptive immunity through immune checkpoint therapy or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have received clinical approval for monotherapy and combination treatment in various cancers. Although these treatments have achieved clinical successes, only a minority of cancer patients show a response, highlighting the urgent need to discover new therapeutic molecules that could be exploited to improve clinical outcomes and pave the way for the next generation of immunotherapy. Given the critical role of the innate immune system against infection and cancer, substantial efforts have been dedicated to developing novel anticancer therapeutics that target these pathways. Targeting the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a powerful strategy to generate a durable antitumor response, and activation of the adaptor protein STING induces the initiation of transcriptional cascades, thereby producing type I interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Various STING agonists, including natural or synthetic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), have been developed as anticancer therapeutics. However, since most CDNs are confined to intratumoral administration, there has been a great interest in developing non-nucleotide agonists for systemic treatment. Here, we review the current development of STING-activating therapeutics in both preclinical and clinical stages. Journal: Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is the 10<sup>th</sup> most commonly occurring malignancy worldwide with a 75% of 5-year survival rate, while it ranks 13<sup>th</sup> among the deaths occurring due to cancer. The majority of bladder cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage and 70% are of non-invasive grade. However, 70% of these cases develop chemoresistance and progress to the muscle invasive stage. Conventional chemotherapy treatments are unsuccessful in curbing chemoresistance, bladder cancer progression while having an adverse side effect, which is mainly due to off-target drug distribution. Therefore, new drug delivery strategies, new therapeutics and therapies or their combination are being explored to develop better treatments. In this regard, nanotechnology has shown promise in the targeted delivery of therapeutics to bladder cancer cells. This review discusses the recent discovery of new therapeutics (chemotherapeutics, immunotherapeutic, and gene therapies), recent developments in the delivery of therapeutics using nano drug delivery systems, and the combination treatments with FDA-approved therapies, i.e., hyperthermia and photodynamic therapy. We also discussed the potential of other novel drug delivery systems that are minimally explored in bladder cancer. Lastly, we discussed the clinical status of therapeutics and therapies for bladder cancer. Overall, this review can provide a summary of available treatments for bladder cancer, and also provide opportunities for further development of drug delivery systems for better management of bladder cancer.

Abstract: Head and neck cancers are a heterogeneous group of highly aggressive tumors and collectively represent the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Current multimodal treatment concepts combine surgery, chemotherapy, irradiation, immunotherapy, and targeted therapeutics. Recent scientific advancements have enabled a more precise molecular characterization of HNSCC and revealed novel therapeutic targets and prognostic/predictive biomarkers. Notably, HNSCC is characterized by complex relations between stromal, epithelial, and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME consists of different subsets of immune cells that infiltrate the tumors and interact with the tumor cells or with each other. Understanding multiple pivotal factors in HNSCC tumorigenesis and tumor progression may help define novel targets and develop more effective therapies for patients. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the molecular biology of HNSCC and their effects on clinical oncology; it is meant for a broad readership in the head and neck cancers field.

Abstract: Mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators are commonly observed at relapse in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Loss-of-function mutations in SETD2, an H3K36 methyltransferase, have been observed in B-ALL and other cancers. Previous studies on mutated SETD2 in solid tumors and acute myelogenous leukemia support a role in promoting resistance to DNA damaging agents. We did not observe chemoresistance, an impaired DNA damage response, nor increased mutation frequency in response to thiopurines using CRISPR-mediated knockout in wild-type B-ALL cell lines. Likewise, restoration of SETD2 in cell lines with hemizygous mutations did not increase sensitivity. <i>SETD2</i> mutations affected the chromatin landscape and transcriptional output that was unique to each cell line. Collectively our data does not support a role for <i>SETD2</i> mutations in driving clonal evolution and relapse in B-ALL, which is consistent with the lack of enrichment of <i>SETD2</i> mutations at relapse in most studies.

Abstract: Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a polyhydroxy phenolic compound extracted from tea and its antitumor effect has received widespread attention. We explored the inhibitory effect of EGCG on dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colorectal cancer (CRC) using a rat model, predicted the interaction between EGCG and CRC target genes using a database, and explained the EGCG associated target pathways and mechanisms in CRC. To understand the inhibitory mechanisms of EGCG on CRC cell proliferation and identify its pharmacological targets by network pharmacology analysis. DMH (40 mg/kg, s.c., twice weekly for eight weeks) was used to induce CRC in rats. After model establishment, the rats were administered with EGCG (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg, p.o., once daily for eight weeks) and killed 12 and 20 wk after the start of the experiment. Formation of aberrant crypt foci and tumor was studied by histological analysis. Using network pharmacology analysis, candidate and collective targets of EGCG and CRC were identified, and Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were used to predict the pathways altered by EGCG. At week 12, high-dose EGCG treatment significantly reduced the tumor formation rate, total number of tumors, cancerous and non-cancerous tumors, tumor volume, ascites formation, and aberrant crypt foci count. At week 20, all three doses of EGCG were effective. Seventy-eight collective targets of EGCG and CRC were identified, of which 28 genes were dysregulated in CRC. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and GO analyses showed that the dysregulated genes were enriched in hsa05210 (CRC), hsa04115 (p53 signaling pathway), and hsa04151 (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway), GO:0043124 (negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling pathway), GO:0043409 (negative regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade), and GO:2001244 (positive regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway) respectively. EGCG inhibits the formation of DMH-induced CRC by regulating key pathways involved in tumorigenesis. Journal: World journal of gastroenterology. Year: 2020.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Field Cancerization in NSCLC: A New Perspective on MicroRNAs in Macrophage Polarization.. Abstract: Lung cancer is currently the first cause of cancer-related death. The major lung cancer subtype is non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), which accounts for approximatively 85% of cases. The major carcinogenic associated with lung cancer is tobacco smoke, which produces long-lasting and progressive damage to the respiratory tract. The progressive and diffuse alterations that occur in the respiratory tract of patients with cancer and premalignant lesions have been described as field cancerization. At the level of tumor cells, adjacent tumor microenvironment (TME) and cancerized field are taking place dynamic interactions through direct cell-to-cell communication or through extracellular vesicles. These molecular messages exchanged between tumor and nontumor cells are represented by proteins, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). In this paper, we analyze the miRNA roles in the macrophage polarization at the level of TME and cancerized field in NSCLC. Identifying molecular players that can influence the phenotypic states at the level of malignant cells, tumor microenvironment and cancerized field can provide us new insights into tumor regulatory mechanisms that can be further modulated to restore the immunogenic capacity of the TME. This approach could revert alterations in the cancerized field and could enhance currently available therapy approaches. Journal: International journal of molecular sciences. Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Revealing cancer driver genes through integrative transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses with Moonlight.. Abstract: Cancer involves dynamic changes caused by (epi)genetic alterations such as mutations or abnormal DNA methylation patterns which occur in cancer driver genes. These driver genes are divided into oncogenes and tumor suppressors depending on their function and mechanism of action. Discovering driver genes in different cancer (sub)types is important not only for increasing current understanding of carcinogenesis but also from prognostic and therapeutic perspectives. We have previously developed a framework called Moonlight which uses a systems biology multi-omics approach for prediction of driver genes. Here, we present an important development in Moonlight2 by incorporating a DNA methylation layer which provides epigenetic evidence for deregulated expression profiles of driver genes. To this end, we present a novel functionality called Gene Methylation Analysis (GMA) which investigates abnormal DNA methylation patterns to predict driver genes. This is achieved by integrating the tool EpiMix which is designed to detect such aberrant DNA methylation patterns in a cohort of patients and further couples these patterns with gene expression changes. To showcase GMA, we applied it to three cancer (sub)types (basal-like breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma) where we discovered 33, 190, and 263 epigenetically driven genes, respectively. A subset of these driver genes had prognostic effects with expression levels significantly affecting survival of the patients. Moreover, a subset of the driver genes demonstrated therapeutic potential as drug targets. This study provides a framework for exploring the driving forces behind cancer and provides novel insights into the landscape of three cancer sub(types) by integrating gene expression and methylation data.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) are associated with tumor development and prognosis. However, there were fewer reports of GPR-related signatures (GPRSs) in soft tissue sarcomas (STSs), and we aim to combine GPR-related genes with cellular landscape to construct diagnostic and prognostic models in STSs. Based on AddModuleScore, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), GPR-related genes (GPRs) were screened at both the single-cell and bulk RNA-seq levels based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. We developed a novel machine learning framework that incorporated 12 machine learning algorithms and their 127 combinations to construct a consensus GPRS to screen biomarkers with diagnostic significance and clinical translation, which was assessed by the internal and external validation datasets. Moreover, the GPR-TME classifier as the prognosis model was constructed and further performed for immune infiltration, functional enrichment, somatic mutation, immunotherapy response prediction, and scRNA-seq analyses. We identified 151 GPR-related genes at both the single-cell and bulk transcriptome levels, and identified a Stepglm[both]+Enet[alpha=0.6] model with seven GPR-related genes as the final diagnostic predictive model with high accuracy and translational relevance using a 127-combination machine learning computational framework, and the GPR-integrated diagnosis nomogram provided a quantitative tool in clinical practice. Moreover, we identified seven prognosis GPRs and five prognosis-good immune cells constructing the GPR score and TME score, respectively. The findings indicate that high expression of GPRs is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with STS, highlighting the significant role of GPRs and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in STS development. Building up a GPR-TME classifier, low GPR combined with high TME exhibited the most favorable prognosis and immunotherapeutic efficacy, which was further performed for immune infiltration, functional enrichment, somatic mutation, immunotherapy response prediction, and scRNA-seq analyses. Our study constructed a GPRS that can serve as a promising tool for diagnosis and prognosis prediction, targeted prevention, and personalized medicine in STS. Journal: Frontiers in immunology.

Abstract: Skin cancer is depicted to be the most common malignant disease across the globe that is frequently diagnosed in people bearing light skin. Three common forms of skin cancers are squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. Treatment of skin cancers comprises of various forms of management strategies that can help in curing the disease including the use of several therapeutic agents. Though numerous therapies have been explored till date to deliver the active therapeutics, nanoparticulate based targeted therapy has garnered considerable interest and is a promising approach in treating skin cancers. The present review aims to explore a novel nano-sized carrier, carbon nanotubes for the delivery of various actives researched for skin cancer treatment. The write up traces the pre-clinical and clinical reports on carbon nanotubes. The feasibility of the nanoparticulate system has been elaborated inclusive of the safety and toxicological aspects of the carrier system. From the reviewed literature it can be concluded that carbon nanotubes are the emerging treatment modality in skin cancers as they offer targeted delivery to the cancerous cells, act selectively and provide better penetration in the neoplastic cells due to improved permeability and retention effect.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Pediatric high-grade glioma: aberrant epigenetics and kinase signaling define emerging therapeutic opportunities.. Abstract: Supratentorial pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) are aggressive malignancies that lack effective treatment options. Deep genomic sequencing by multiple groups has revealed that the primary alterations unique to pHGGs occur in epigenetic and kinase genes. These mutations, fusions, and deletions present a therapeutic opportunity by use of small molecules targeting epigenetic modifiers and kinases that contribute to pHGG growth. Using a targeted search of the pre-clinical literature and clinicaltrials.gov for kinase and epigenetic pathways in pHGG, we collectively describe how these mechanisms are being targeted in pre-clinical animal models and in current clinical trials, as well as propose unexplored therapeutic possibilities for future investigations. Relevant pHGG kinases are targetable by several FDA-approved or clinical-stage kinase inhibitors, including altered BRAF/MET/NTRK/ALK and wild-type PI3K/EGFR/PDGFR/VEGF/AXL. Epigenetic proteins implicated in pHGG are also clinically targetable and include histone erasers, writers and readers such as HDACs, demethylases LSD1/JMJD3, methyltransferase EZH2, chromatin reader bromodomains, and chromatin remodeler subunit BMI-1. Crosstalk between these pathways can occur involving kinases such as EGFR and AMPK interacting with epigenetic modifiers such as HDACs or EZH2. Single agent trial results of kinase inhibitors or epigenetic targets alone are underwhelming and hampered by poor pharmacokinetics, adaptive resistance, and broad inclusion criteria. The genetic and phenotypic diversity of pHGGs is now well characterized after large-scale sequencing studies on patient tissue. However, clinical treatment paradigms have not yet shifted in response to this information. Combination therapies targeting multiple kinases or epigenetic targets may hold more promise, especially if attempted in selected patient populations with hemispheric pHGG tumors and relevant targeted therapeutic biomarkers.

Abstract: Chemotherapy resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are being targeted as a modern therapeutic approach to prevent disease relapse. LSCs isolated from methotrexate resistant side population (SP) of leukemic cell lines HL60 and MOLT4 exhibited high levels of CD25 and TRAIL R2/DR5 which are potential targets. Recombinant immunotoxin conjugating IL2\u03b1 with TRAIL peptide mimetic was constructed for DR5 receptor specific targeting of LSCs and were tested in total cell population and LSCs. IL2-TRAIL peptide induced apoptosis in drug resistant SP cells from cell lines and showed potent cytotoxicity in PBMCs derived from leukemic patients with an efficacy of 81.25% in AML and 100% in CML, ALL and CLL. IL2-TRAIL peptide showed cytotoxicity in relapsed patient samples and was more effective than TRAIL or IL2-TRAIL proteins. Additionally, DR5 specific IL2-TRAIL peptide was effective in targeting and killing LSCs purified from cell lines [IC50: 952nM in HL60, 714nM in MOLT4] and relapsed patient blood samples with higher efficacy (85%) than IL2-TRAIL protein (46%). Hence, CD25 and DR5 specific targeting by IL2-TRAIL peptide may be an effective strategy for targeting drug resistant leukemic cells and LSCs. Journal: Stem cell research. Year: 2017.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children in the context of microarray analyses.. Abstract: Over the last four decades the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved remarkably. However, still about 20% of children with ALL relapse despite risk-adapted polychemotherapy. The prognosis of relapsed ALL is relatively poor, even with modern aggressive chemotherapy. Identification of the biological and genetic mechanisms contributing to recurrence in patients with ALL is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat refractory leukemic patients. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for many children with relapsed ALL. The gene expression profile obtained by microarray technology could provide important determinants of the drug response and clinical outcome in childhood ALL. Incorporation of the data on expression levels of newly identified genes into existing strategies of risk stratification might improve clinical management. Current microarray data show correlation of in vitro drug resistance with significant patterns of gene expression and explain clinical differences between early and late relapse. Genes involved in cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation, protein biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and DNA replication and repair are usually among those highly expressed in relapsed lymphoblasts. Current status and future perspectives of microarray data on gene expression and drug resistance profile in relapsed pediatric ALL are discussed in this review.

Abstract: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) comprise a heterogeneous group of 15 different neoplasms in adults. In Europe and North America, PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL NOS), nodal T follicular helper lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic type (nTFHL-AI), and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) either anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive (+) or negative (-) are the most prevalent PTCLs. Relapsed or refractory disease (R/R) is common in PTCL and its management is challenging. Despite response rates and prognoses being disease specific, the outcome of R/R PTCL is dismal except for R/R ALK+ ALCL. Populations in R/R PTCL studies have mostly been heterogeneous and encompassing several entities. While there are many treatment options for R/R PTCL such as salvage chemotherapy, autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant, epigenetic drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and small molecules, responses are limited and few are curative. Here we review the management of R/R PTCL, focusing on ALCL, nTFHL, and PTCL NOS. Journal: Leukemia & lymphoma. Year: 2025. Authors: Meeuwes FO, Serroukh YIM, van der Poel MWM, Plattel WJ, Nijland M.

Abstract: The development of cancer has been an extensively researched topic over the past few decades. Although great strides have been made in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, there is still much to be learned about cancer's micro-environmental mechanisms that contribute to cancer formation and aggressiveness. Macrophages, lymphocytes which originate from monocytes, are involved in the inflammatory response and often dispersed to areas of infection to fight harmful antigens and mutated cells in tissues. Macrophages have a plethora of roles including tissue development and repair, immune system functions, and inflammation. We discuss various pathways by which macrophages get activated, various approaches that can regulate the function of macrophages, and how these approaches can be helpful in developing new cancer therapies.

Abstract: Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the main causes of malignant neoplasms, especially cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers. Although we have developed preventive vaccines that can protect from HPV infection, there are still many new cases of HPV-related cancers worldwide. Early diagnosis and therapy are therefore important for the treatment of these diseases. As HPVs are the major contributors to these cancers, it is reasonable to develop reagents, kits, or devices to detect and eliminate HPVs for early diagnosis and therapeutics. Immunological methods are precise strategies that are promising for the accurate detection and blockade of HPVs. During the last decades, the mechanism of how HPVs induce neoplasms has been extensively elucidated, and several oncogenic HPV early proteins, including E5, E6, and E7, have been shown to be positively related to the oncogenesis and malignancy of HPV-induced cancers. These oncoproteins are promising biomarkers for diagnosis and as targets for the therapeutics of HPV-related cancers. Importantly, many specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or newly designed antibody mimics, as well as new immunological kits, devices, and reagents have been developed for both the immunodiagnosis and immunotherapeutics of HPV-induced cancers. In the current review, we summarize the research progress in the immunodiagnosis and immunotherapeutics based on HPV for HPV-induced cancers. In particular, we depict the most promising serological methods for the detection of HPV infection and several therapeutical immunotherapeutics based on HPV, using immunological tools, including native mAbs, radio-labelled mAbs, affitoxins (affibody-linked toxins), intracellular single-chain antibodies (scFvs), nanobodies, therapeutical vaccines, and T-cell-based therapies. Our review aims to provide new clues for researchers to develop novel strategies and methods for the diagnosis and treatment of HPV-induced tumors. Journal: Frontiers in immunology. Year: 2020.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cracking the resistance code: The molecular reclassification of cancer and precision therapy strategies.. Abstract: The molecular reclassification of cancer has enabled a therapeutic revolution. We now know that metastatic cancers have heterogenous molecular landscapes, which can differ within and between histologies, and may also vary between tumor sites in a single individual, and even between clones in a single tumor. Moreover, clonal evolution develops as cancers metastasize and throughout the course of treatment, which can lead to therapeutic resistance. Treating disease early and personalized therapeutic approaches including molecularly targeted therapies, along with N-of-1 individualized, biomarker-based combination approaches may improve outcomes and address resistance. Reassessing the tumor landscape throughout treatment with frequent tissue biopsies and with liquid biopsies at progression can help identify resistance pathways and provide information for selecting more effective later-line therapies. The heterogenous nature of metastatic tumors at different sites and within a single site can lead to mixed responses; thus, combination therapeutic approaches and understanding the sources of tumor heterogeneity is key to providing durable therapeutic benefit. Elucidating and targeting critical drivers, such as fusions, is also important. In the presence of undruggable key tumor drivers, targeting the immunome, RNA transcripts, and/or cell-surface proteins may circumvent the issue posed by a molecular driver that is not actionable. For tumors with a large number of alterations, exploiting synthetic lethality, precision immunotherapy, functional studies, antibody-drug conjugates, and computational approaches may optimize therapeutic efficacy without targeting every critical driver. Given ongoing clonal evolution and the heterogeneity of metastatic tumors, evolving precision medicine technologies and therapeutic approaches will be critical to improving outcomes for patients with cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Synthetic lethality as an engine for cancer drug target discovery.. Abstract: The first wave of genetically targeted therapies for cancer focused on drugging gene products that are recurrently mutated in specific cancer types. However, mutational analysis of tumours has largely been exhausted as a strategy for the identification of new cancer targets that are druggable with conventional approaches. Furthermore, some known genetic drivers of cancer have not been directly targeted yet owing to their molecular structure (undruggable oncogenes) or because they result in functional loss (tumour suppressor genes). Functional genomic screening based on the genetic concept of synthetic lethality provides an avenue to discover drug targets in all these areas. Although synthetic lethality is not a new idea, recent advances, including CRISPR-based gene editing, have made possible systematic screens for synthetic lethal drug targets in human cancers. Such approaches have broad potential to drive the discovery of the next wave of genetic cancer targets and ultimately the introduction of effective medicines that are still needed for most cancers.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrative epigenomic and high-throughput functional enhancer profiling reveals determinants of enhancer heterogeneity in gastric cancer.. Abstract: Enhancers are distal cis-regulatory elements required for cell-specific gene expression and cell fate determination. In cancer, enhancer variation has been proposed as a major cause of inter-patient heterogeneity-however, most predicted enhancer regions remain to be functionally tested. We analyzed 132 epigenomic histone modification profiles of 18 primary gastric cancer (GC) samples, 18 normal gastric tissues, and 28 GC cell lines using Nano-ChIP-seq technology. We applied Capture-based Self-Transcribing Active Regulatory Region sequencing (CapSTARR-seq) to assess functional enhancer activity. An Activity-by-contact (ABC) model was employed to explore the effects of histone acetylation and CapSTARR-seq levels on enhancer-promoter interactions. We report a comprehensive catalog of 75,730 recurrent predicted enhancers, the majority of which are GC-associated in vivo (>\u200950,000) and associated with lower somatic mutation rates inferred by whole-genome sequencing. Applying CapSTARR-seq to the enhancer catalog, we observed significant correlations between CapSTARR-seq functional activity and H3K27ac/H3K4me1 levels. Super-enhancer regions exhibited increased CapSTARR-seq signals compared to regular enhancers, even when decoupled from native chromatin contexture. We show that combining histone modification and CapSTARR-seq functional enhancer data improves the prediction of enhancer-promoter interactions and pinpointing of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), and trans-acting TFs involved in GC expression. We identified cancer-relevant genes (ING1, ARL4C) whose expression between patients is influenced by enhancer differences in genomic copy number and germline SNPs, and HNF4\u03b1 as a master trans-acting factor associated with GC enhancer heterogeneity. Our results indicate that combining histone modification and functional assay data may provide a more accurate metric to assess enhancer activity than either platform individually, providing insights into the relative contribution of genetic (cis) and regulatory (trans) mechanisms to GC enhancer functional heterogeneity.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Olaparib Monotherapy or in Combination with Abiraterone for the Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) and a BRCA Mutation.. Abstract: Treatment strategies to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are evolving. Of particular interest are therapies that target DNA damage responses in tumor cells by inhibiting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity. Several PARP inhibitors have recently received regulatory approval for the treatment of patients with mCRPC, of which olaparib was the first for prostate cancer. Olaparib received approval as a monotherapy following the PROfound study (NCT02987543) and in combination with abiraterone following the PROpel study (NCT03732820) for mCRPC. Both PROfound (homologous recombination repair mutation biomarker-selected) and PROpel (biomarker unselected) patients\u00a0demonstrated statistically significant longer radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) with olaparib versus their respective control arms in the intention-to-treat population. In both studies, the greatest clinical benefit with olaparib was seen in patients with BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations (BRCAm): PROfound rPFS hazard ratio (HR) 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.32); PROpel rPFS HR 0.23 (95% CI 0.12-0.43). Clinical benefit was also observed in terms of overall survival: PROfound HR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42-0.95); PROpel HR 0.29 (95% CI 0.14-0.56). We provide a comprehensive overview of the utility of olaparib for patients with mCRPC harboring a BRCAm. Key clinical and safety data in BRCAm subgroup populations are discussed, predominantly based on findings from PROfound and PROpel, as well as investigator-initiated studies, to help inform treatment decision-making in this patient population. We also discuss the importance of genetic testing to identify patients who may optimally benefit from treatment with olaparib, either as a monotherapy or in combination with abiraterone.

For all the hope and promise immunotherapies and molecular targeted therapies have shown for systemic malignancies, these treatments have failed to show any promise in GBM. In this context, the paradigm of investigation of therapeutics for this disease itself must be examined and modifications considered. The unique challenge of the presence of blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers (BBB/BTB) raises questions about both the true levels of systemic drug delivery to the affected tissues. Window-of-opportunity (WoO) trials in neuro-oncology allow for proof-of-concept at the start of a classic phase I-II-III clinical trial progression. For therapeutics that do not have the ability to cross the BBB/BTB, direct delivery into tumor and/or tumor-infiltrated brain in the setting of a surgical procedure can provide a novel route of therapeutic access. These approaches permit neurosurgeons to play a greater role in therapeutic development for brain tumors. Journal: Advanced drug delivery reviews. Year: 2022.

Abstract: Osimertinib is currently used as a first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, and the emergence of drug resistance poses a substantial challenge. Liquid biopsy with a multi-gene panel can examine both the molecular mechanisms and possibility of early resistance diagnosis. We used a molecular barcode library construction kit (Archer<sup>\u00ae</sup> LiquidPlex\u2122) that allowed the analysis of multiple cancer-related genes using cell-free DNA from the plasma samples of patients. We collected plasma from 17 consecutive patients with lung adenocarcinoma at our hospital at various time points and cell-free DNA was extracted and subjected to LiquidPlex analysis. Plasma DNA concentration was not associated with the presence or absence of resistance to osimertinib. The pathological mutations detected using next-generation sequencing in the resistant specimens were in MAP2K1, PIK3CA, TP53, BRAF, and EGFR. Among the recurrent cases, EGFR mutations identified at the initial diagnosis were detected within 6 months before relapse confirmation in four cases (average 88 days). Many of the recurrent cases without detection of known EGFR mutations in the liquid biopsy showed a longer interval between the detection of relapse and the last blood draw for the liquid biopsy (average 255 days). Frequent liquid biopsies are useful for identifying known EGFR mutations as markers for early detection of relapse. Several cancer driver mutations were observed, suggesting a variety of mechanisms of resistance in first-line osimertinib-treated lung adenocarcinoma. Journal: Anticancer research. Year: 2023.

Abstract: Breast cancer classification has been the focus of numerous worldwide efforts, analyzing the molecular basis of breast cancer subtypes and aiming to associate them with clinical outcome and to improve the current diagnostic routine. Genomic and transcriptomic profiles of breast cancer have been well established, however the proteomic contribution to these profiles has yet to be elucidated. In this work, we utilized mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis on more than 130 clinical breast samples to demonstrate intertumor heterogeneity across three breast cancer subtypes and healthy tissue. Unsupervised analysis identified four proteomic clusters, among them, one that represents a novel luminal subtype characterized by increased PI3K signaling. This subtype was further validated using an independent protein-based dataset, but not in two independent transcriptome cohorts. These results demonstrate the importance of deep proteomic analysis, which may affect cancer treatment decision making.<b>Significance:</b> These findings utilize extensive proteomics to identify a novel luminal breast cancer subtype, highlighting the added value of clinical proteomics in breast cancer to identify unique features not observable by genomic approaches. <i>Cancer Res; 78(20); 6001-10. \u00a92018 AACR</i>.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Nanocarrier drug delivery systems for gynecological cancer therapeutics.. Abstract: Drug delivery systems (DDS) enhance drug delivery for treating gynecological cancers by increasing the bioavailability of commonly prescribed chemotherapeutics in these cancers. Gynecological cancers may originate in the ovary or fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and the vagina or vulva; each tissue of origin presenting unique signatures that determine the efficacy of active pharmaceutical ingredients in treating these cancers. Aside from cervical cancer, no screening mechanisms exist for gynecological cancers and therefore these cancers are typically diagnosed at later stages. Pre-clinical development for nanocarrier DDS has focused on improving existing treatments and developing DDS for novel therapies. For example, metals, metal oxides, and metal organic frameworks, have been investigated in ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers as alternatives to platinum-containing chemotherapeutics. Alternatively, polymeric delivery methods such as dendrimers, nano-/micro-spheres or implants can improve the delivery of existing drugs by offering greater specificity for the target tissue and thus higher bioavailability. Advances in drug delivery systems enhance the therapeutic efficacy of gynecological cancer treatments, but clinical translation still requires significant stages of investigations, including in vivo studies and clinical trials.

Abstract: Metabolic reprogramming is an important cancer hallmark. Recent studies have indicated that lipid metabolic reprogramming play a potential role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we employed an integrated multi-omics approach, combining transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, to explore the lipid metabolism pathways in HCC and evaluate their diagnostic potential.We collected ten pairs of HCC tissues (HCT) and adjacent non-tumor tissues (ANT) from patients undergoing surgical resection. Transcriptomic analysis identified 4,023 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCT and ANT, with significant enrichment in lipid metabolism-related pathways, including fatty acid degradation and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Proteomic analysis revealed 2,531 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), further highlighting lipid metabolism as a critical driver of HCC development. Metabolomic profiling identified 88 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs), with notable alterations in lipid-related metabolites. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data identified six key genes (LCAT, PEMT, ACSL1, GPD1, ACSL4, and LPCAT1) involved in lipid metabolism, which exhibited significant changes at both mRNA and protein levels and correlated strongly with lipid-related metabolites in HCT. Additionally, nine lipid-related metabolites were identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers for HCC, with six metabolites demonstrating high discriminative ability (AUC\u2009>\u20090.8) between HCT and ANT.Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism reprogramming in HCC, emphasize the critical role of lipid metabolism in its pathogenesis. The identification of lipid-related metabolites as potential diagnostic biomarkers holds significant promise for early detection and improved clinical management of HCC.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: CAR-T Therapy in Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma.. Abstract: Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm. The emergence of proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies has improved the prognosis of multiple myeloma patients. However, some patients are still insensitive to conventional therapy or frequently relapse after remission. Chemotherapy based on proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulatory drugs is ineffective in controlling the progression of relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. No consensus has been reached on treating relapsed refractory multiple myeloma to date. Recently chimeric antigen receptor T cells therapy has shown promising results that could achieve rapid remissions of patients and improve their prognoses. Additionally, most patients in chimeric antigen receptor T cell clinical trials were triple-refractory multiple myeloma patients, indicating that chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy could overcome drug resistance to new drugs. Since single immunotherapies are prone to acquired resistance, combination immunotherapies based on emerging immunotherapies may solve this issue. Achieving complete remission and minimal residual disease negative status as soon as possible is beneficial to patients. This paper reviewed the main chimeric antigen receptor T cell products in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, and it explained the drug resistance mechanism and improvement methods of chimeric antigen receptor T cells therapy. This review summarized the best beneficiaries of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy and the salvage treatment of disease recurrence after chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, providing some ideas for the clinical application of chimeric antigen receptor T cells.

Abstract: Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the single most common childhood malignancy. Despite substantial improvements in therapy, cases in which relapse occurs are still more common than newly diagnosed cases of many other childhood cancers. The survival of patients who relapse despite improved therapy continues to be of interest. One thousand one hundred forty-four relapses and 28 second malignant neoplasms were identified among the 3712 eligible patients enrolled on Children's Cancer Group trials between 1983 and 1989. The details of treatment after relapse were not accessible. Subsequent secondary event free survival and overall survival were examined by the site of and time to initial relapse. A variety of potential prognostic factors were examined employing the log rank statistic and Wilcoxon regression model. Rates of 6-year survival (+/- standard error) after isolated bone marrow, isolated central nervous system (CNS), and isolated testis relapse were 20%+/-2%, 48%+/-4%, and 70%+/-5%, respectively. Rates of survival after isolated bone marrow relapse at 0-17 months, 18-35 months, and after 36 months were 6%+/-2%, 11%+/-2%, and 43%+/-4%, respectively. Rates of survival after isolated CNS relapse at 0-17 months, 18-35 months, and after 36 months were 33%+/-4%, 59%+/-5%, and 72%+/-8%, respectively. Rates of survival after isolated testis relapse at 0-17 months, 18-35 months, and after 36 months were 52%+/-11%, 57%+/-10%, and 81%+/-5%, respectively. Rates of survival after combined bone marrow and CNS or testis relapse at 0-17 months, 18-35 months, and after 36 months were 9%+/-5%, 11%+/-6%, and 49%+/-7%, respectively. Substantial survival at 6 years is evident among several subsets of this unselected group of heterogeneously treated children, namely, those with isolated or combined bone marrow relapse after 36 months and those with isolated extramedullary relapse at any time.

Utilizing many rapidly emerging sequencing technologies, researchers have studied cancer genomes to understand the molecular statuses of cancer cells and to reveal their vulnerabilities, such as driver mutations or gene expression. Long-read technologies enable us to identify and characterize novel types of cancerous mutations, including complicated structural variants in haplotype resolution. In this review, we introduce three representative platforms for long-read sequencing and research trends of cancer genomics with long-read data. Further, we describe that aberrant transcriptome and epigenome statuses, namely, fusion transcripts, as well as aberrant transcript isoforms and the phase information of DNA methylation, are able to be elucidated by long-read sequencers. Long-read sequencing may shed light on novel types of aberrations in cancer genomics that are being missed by conventional short-read sequencing analyses. Journal: Journal of human genetics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Personalized cancer therapy with selective kinase inhibitors: an emerging paradigm in medical oncology.. Abstract: Selective kinase inhibitors have emerged as an important class of anticancer agents, with demonstrated clinical efficacy and generally favorable toxicity profiles in several common disease settings where conventional treatments have previously provided only modest benefit. Consequently, a substantial effort is now underway to identify additional therapeutically relevant kinase targets and to develop and test inhibitors of those proteins in a variety of human malignancies. However, it has also become clear that the clinical benefit associated with these agents is typically limited to a subset of treated patients, who in many cases are defined by a specific genomic lesion within their tumor cells--frequently, an activating mutation within the gene encoding the target kinase. This discovery has prompted efforts to stratify patients before treatment with kinase inhibitors based on specific genomic biomarkers, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes through the effective personalization of treatment (ie, matching the right patients with the right therapies). With recent advances in our understanding of the relationship between tumor genotypes and cancer cell sensitivity to kinase inhibition, together with improved technologies for rapidly genotyping tumor biopsies for relevant lesions, the implementation of personalized cancer care with this exciting new class of inhibitors is now becoming a reality. In this review, we summarize recent developments in this area, and we highlight some of the logistical challenges posed by this emerging paradigm in medical oncology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Relapsed acute leukemia in children: Oman experience.. Abstract: Acute leukemia (AL) is the most common malignancy in children in Oman. It accounts for over one-third of all childhood cancers, most of which (approximately 75%) are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Over a decade, a total of 128 cases of childhood acute leukemia have been diagnosed and managed at Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Unit, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, which is the national referral center of pediatric leukemia cases. A retrospective review of case notes was used to study all children with a diagnosis of acute leukemia from January 1993 to January 2003. All the cases were diagnosed using a bone marrow aspirate with morphological and immunophenotypic classification. Over this period, 24 cases relapsed. They were classified as per BFM group as \"very early,\" \"early,\" and \"late\" according to the time from diagnosis to first relapse and were divided into isolated bone marrow (BM), extramedullary site, and combined relapse. Sixteen percent of ALL cases and 58.6% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases so far relapsed. Most of the AML cases relapsed very early on in treatment. Eleven patients had combined relapse in BM and extramedullary site (9 in the central nervous system, 1 in the testicles, and 1 in the eye). The overall outcome of these patients is very poor, and only 6 patients out of 24 are still alive. In conclusion, the relapse rates of childhood AL are more or less similar to those of other reports but the overall outcome is very poor. A large majority of the patients in this study are either very early or early relapsers. Future studies including genetic and molecular analysis may be able to explain the difference in clinical outcome of these relapsed AL cases. Journal: Pediatric hematology and oncology. Year: 2004.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: High-dose cytarabine as salvage therapy for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia--is more better or more of the same?. Abstract: Cytarabine is the backbone of most chemotherapeutic regimens for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), yet the optimal dose for salvage therapy of refractory or relapsed AML (RR-AML) has not been established. Very high dose single-agent cytarabine at 36\u2009g/m(2) (ARA-36) was previously shown to be effective and tolerable in RR-AML. In this retrospective analysis, we aim to describe the toxicity and efficacy of ARA-36 as salvage therapy for patients with AML who are primary refractory to intensive daunorubicin-containing induction or those relapsing after allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). Fifteen patients, median age 53\u2009years, were included in the analysis. Six patients were treated for induction failure, one had resistant APL, and eight relapsed after alloSCT. Complete remission was achieved in 60% of patients. Surviving patients were followed for a median of 8.5\u2009months. One-year overall survival was 54% (95% CI 30%-86%), and relapse rate from remission (n\u2009=\u20099) was 56%. Grade III/IV pulmonary, infectious, ocular and gastrointestinal toxicities occurred in 26%, 20%, 20% and 20% of patients respectively. Salvage therapy with ARA-36 regimen for RR-AML has considerable efficacy with manageable toxicity in patients with induction failure or post-transplant relapse. Overall survival in these high-risk patients still remains poor. Journal: Hematological oncology. Year: 2016. Authors: Wolach O, Itchaki G, Bar-Natan M, Yeshurun M, Ram R.

Abstract: MiRNA is a class of small non-coding RNA molecule that regulates gene expression at post-transcriptional level. Increasing evidences show aberrant expression of miRNAs in a variety of diseases. Targeting the dysregulated miRNAs with small molecule drugs has become a novel therapeutics for many human diseases, especially cancers. In this chapter, we introduced a series of computational studies for prediction of small molecule and miRNA associations. Based on different hypotheses, such as transcriptional response similarity, functional consistence or network closeness, the small molecule-miRNA networks were constructed and further analyzed. In addition, several resources that collected experimentally validated relationships or computational predicted associations between small molecules and miRNAs were provided. Collectively, these computational frameworks and databases pave a new way for miRNA-targeted therapy and drug repositioning. Journal: Advances in experimental medicine and biology. Year: 2018.

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is a common endocrine malignancy; however, surgery remains its primary treatment option. A novel targeted drug for the development and application of targeted therapy in thyroid cancer treatment remain underexplored.We obtained RNA sequence data of thyroid cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, we constructed co-expression network with DEGs and combined it with differentially methylation analysis to screen the key genes in thyroid cancer. PockDrug-Server, an online tool, was applied to predict the druggability of the key genes. Finally, we constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to observe potential targeted drugs for thyroid cancer.We identified 3 genes correlated with altered DNA methylation level and oncogenesis of thyroid cancer. According to the druggable analysis and PPI network, we predicted TRAF2 and NCK-interacting protein kinase (TNIK) sever as the drug targeted for thyroid cancer. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis indicated that genes in protein-protein interaction network of TNIK enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. For drug repositioning, we identified a targeted drug of genes in PPI network.Our study provides a bioinformatics method for screening drug targets and provides a theoretical basis for thyroid cancer targeted therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeted therapy for pediatric glioma: RAF(t)ing in the molecular era.. Abstract: Pediatric gliomas are the most frequently occurring central nervous system tumors in children. While targeted therapies have been widely applied in the treatment of many adult cancers, their use in pediatric gliomas has lagged behind. However, recent advances in multiomics profiling of pediatric gliomas, coupled with the approval of inhibitors against\u00a0Raf serine/threonine kinase (RAF), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK), have spurred significant progress in this field. In light of these developments, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current advancements and the evolving landscape of targeted therapeutic strategies and approaches for pediatric gliomas. Data analyzed in this study were obtained from the literature from PubMed, as well as other online databases and websites, including ClinicalTrials.gov and the Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium. Based on findings from multiomics profiling, significant insights have been gained into the genetic and molecular landscape of pediatric gliomas, enabling the identification of key mutations and potentially targetable lesions. These advancements provide rationales for the development of more precise treatment strategies and targeted therapies. Recent approvals of targeted therapies and ongoing clinical trials in pediatric gliomas are converging on the targeting of key signaling molecules and metabolic pathways. In the molecular era, targeted therapies offer new hope for more effective and personalized treatment options for pediatric glioma patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting the relaxin hormonal pathway in prostate cancer.. Abstract: Targeting the androgen signalling pathway has long been the hallmark of anti-hormonal therapy for prostate cancer. However, development of androgen-independent prostate cancer is an inevitable outcome to therapies targeting this pathway, in part, owing to the shift from cancer dependence on androgen signalling for growth in favor of augmentation of other cellular pathways that provide proliferation-, survival- and angiogenesis-promoting signals. This review focuses on the role of the hormone relaxin in the development and progression of prostate cancer, prior to and after the onset of androgen independence, as well as its role in cancers of other reproductive tissues. As the body of literature expands, examining relaxin expression in cancerous tissues and its role in a growing number of in vitro and in vivo cancer models, our understanding of the important involvement of this hormone in cancer biology is becoming clearer. Specifically, the pleiotropic functions of relaxin affecting cell growth, angiogenesis, blood flow, cell migration and extracellular matrix remodeling are examined in the context of cancer progression. The interactions and intercepts of the intracellular signalling pathways of relaxin with the androgen pathway are explored in the context of progression of castration-resistant and androgen-independent prostate cancers. We provide an overview of current anti-hormonal therapeutic treatment options for prostate cancer and delve into therapeutic approaches and development of agents aimed at specifically antagonizing relaxin signalling to curb tumor growth. We also discuss the rationale and challenges utilizing such agents as novel anti-hormonals in the clinic, and their potential to supplement current therapeutic modalities.

Abstract: Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a 14kDa carbohydrate-binding protein of the galectin family found in humans, affects intracellular signaling pathways upon interaction with \u03b2-galactosides on cell-surface, cytosol, and nucleus. The structural information reveals that it consists of a monovalent dimer composed of subunits with one Carbohydrate Recognition Domain (CRD), which is the main active site to interact with various glycoproteins, and carbohydrates in the body to regulate cellular functions. Gal-1 contributes towards different events associated with cancer biology, including tumor transformation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, migration, and inflammation. The extracellular existence and function of Gal-1 have been well-established, and it is known to express in many tumor types, including astrocytoma, melanoma, prostate, colon, bladder, and ovarian carcinomas, etc. Several studies suggested the upregulation of Gal-1 levels in multiple cancer cells. Thus, Gal-1 is a promising molecular target for the development of new therapeutic tools. The present review focuses on the functions of Gal-1 in tumor progression in multiple cancers and its structural insights. Journal: Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a chronic hematologic malignancy that remains incurable as most patients eventually relapse or become resistant to several treatments. Although many novel therapeutic approaches (targeted small molecules, antibodies, and cell therapies) have been developed against MM, the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance driven by the heterogeneous evolution of MM cells greatly impede the therapeutic outcomes of current clinical treatments. RNA therapeutics have recently shown great promise against cancers. By therapeutically inhibiting or upregulating target sequences, RNA therapeutics would become a solid treatment against MM, and its combination therapies with other agents would greatly enhance the response sensitivity of MM cells. However, the valid nucleic acid targets and favored delivery systems for RNA therapeutics against MM remain uncovered. This review elaborates on the current clinical challenges of MM treatments and highlights the therapeutic advantages of targeting RNA which are abnormally expressed in MM cells. By summarizing the potential molecular targets, delivery systems, and clinical challenges, this review further provides insights into the therapeutic potential of RNA modalities against MM and its clinical translation globally.

Despite these advances, precision oncology has practical constraints, partly related to cancer's biological diversity and spatial and temporal complexity. Advanced imaging technologies are being developed to address some of the current limitations in early detection, treatment selection and planning, drug delivery, and therapeutic response, as well as difficulties posed by drug resistance, drug toxicity, disease monitoring, and metastatic evolution. We discuss key areas of advanced imaging for improving cancer outcomes and survival.

Abstract: The great majority of relapses after the treatment for early-stage Hodgkin's disease are observed within 4 to 5 years after treatment completion. This study describes the characteristics and outcome of patients who had late relapses, which was defined as relapses that occurred 5 or more years after initial treatment start. A total of 1,082 adult patients with early clinical stage Hodgkin's disease were enrolled on three consecutive European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) protocols (H1, H2, and H5 trials) from 1964 to 1981. Of these, 1,044 patients satisfied the eligibility criteria with a supradiaphragmatic localization, age greater than 15 years, and initial complete remission. Overall, 341 patients (32.6%) relapsed, 304 (29.1%) early and 37 (3.5%) late. For each of these 37 late relapsers, questionnaires were sent to the participating centers and detailed information for 34 relapses was obtained. Cumulative probabilities for developing a late relapse were estimated using the Kaplan and Meier method. Quantification of the relationship between late relapse and several confounding variables was performed using the Cox's proportional hazards model. The 10- and 15-year cumulative probabilities of late relapse in patients who were disease-free at 5 years were 4.8% and 8.3%, respectively. Patients treated on more recent protocols had a higher incidence of late relapse, possibly due to an attempt to tailor therapy to the specific prognostic factors (10-year cumulative probabilities, 4.6%, 2.6%, and 7.5% in trials H1, H2, and H5, respectively). Incidence of late relapses significantly correlated with male sex, B symptoms, mediastinal involvement, and treatment modality. Salvage treatment induced a complete response in 27 patients (79%) and a prolonged complete remission in 24 patients (71%). Twenty years after initial treatment start, similar overall survival rates were observed for late relapsing (72%) and nonrelapsing patients (75%). Late relapses of Hodgkin's disease are uncommon, but may be more frequent with recent protocols tailored to specific prognostic factors. If treated, their outcome is favorable. Late relapse is therefore another factor indicating that careful, long-term follow-up is needed for patients with Hodgkin's disease.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Next generation sequencing in cancer: opportunities and challenges for precision cancer medicine.. Abstract: Over the past decade, testing the genes of patients and their specific cancer types has become standardized practice in medical oncology since somatic mutations, changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications are all hallmarks of cancer. However, while cancer genetic assessment has been limited to single biomarkers to guide the use of therapies, improvements in nucleic acid sequencing technologies and implementation of different genome analysis tools have enabled clinicians to detect these genomic alterations and identify functional and disease-associated genomic variants. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have provided clues about therapeutic targets and genomic markers for novel clinical applications when standard therapy has failed. While Sanger sequencing, an accurate and sensitive approach, allows for the identification of potential novel variants, it is however limited by the single amplicon being interrogated. Similarly, quantitative and qualitative profiling of gene expression changes also represents a challenge for the cancer field. Both RT-PCR and microarrays are efficient approaches, but are limited to the genes present on the array or being assayed. This leaves vast swaths of the transcriptome, including non-coding RNAs and other features, unexplored. With the advent of the ability to collect and analyze genomic sequence data in a timely fashion and at an ever-decreasing cost, many of these limitations have been overcome and are being incorporated into cancer research and diagnostics giving patients and clinicians new hope for targeted and personalized treatment.

Abstract: While hepatitis B and C viral infection have been suppressed, non-B non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC) is considered to be rising in incidence terms in some developed countries where prevalence of those viral infections among HCC patients had been very high (such as Japan, Korea, and Italy). To elucidate critical molecular changes in NBNC-HCC, we integrated three large datasets relating to comprehensive array-based analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation (N = 43 pairs) and mRNA/miRNA expression (N = 15, and 24 pairs, respectively) via statistical modeling. Hierarchical clustering of DNA methylation in miRNA coding regions clearly distinguished NBNC-HCC tissue samples from relevant background tissues, revealing a remarkable tumor-specific hypomethylation cluster. In addition, miRNA clusters were extremely hypomethylated in tumor samples (median methylation change for non-clustered miRNAs: -2.3%, clustered miRNAs: -24.6%). The proportion of CpGs hypomethylated in more than 90% of the samples was 55.9% of all CpGs within miRNA clusters, and the peak methylation level was drastically shifted from 84% to 39%. Following statistical adjustment, the difference in methylation levels within miRNA coding regions was positively associated with their expression change. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed a great discriminatory ability in respect to cluster-miRNA methylation. Moreover, miRNA methylation change was negatively correlated with corresponding target gene expression amongst conserved and highly matched miRNA sites. We observed a drastic negative shift of methylation levels in miRNA cluster regions. Changes in methylation status of miRNAs were more indicative of target gene expression and pathological diagnosis than respective miRNA expression changes, suggesting the importance of genome-wide miRNA methylation for tumor development. Our study dynamically summarized global miRNA hypomethylation and its genome-wide scale consequence in NBNC-HCC. Journal: Molecular cancer. Year: 2016.

Abstract: Remarkable progress has been made in the development of new therapies for cancer, dramatically changing the landscape of treatment approaches for several malignancies and continuing to increase patient survival. Accordingly, adverse effects of cancer therapies that interfere with the continuation of best-possible care, induce life-threatening risks or lead to long-term morbidity are gaining increasing importance. Cardiovascular toxic effects of cancer therapeutics and radiation therapy are the epitome of such concerns, and proper knowledge, interpretation and management are needed and have to be placed within the context of the overall care of individual patients with cancer. Furthermore, the cardiotoxicity spectrum has broadened to include myocarditis with immune checkpoint inhibitors and cardiac dysfunction in the setting of cytokine release syndrome with chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. An increase in the incidence of arrhythmias related to inflammation such as atrial fibrillation can also be expected, in addition to the broadening set of cancer therapeutics that can induce prolongation of the corrected QT interval. Therefore, cardiologists of today have to be familiar not only with the cardiotoxicity associated with traditional cancer therapies, such as anthracycline, trastuzumab or radiation therapy, but even more so with an ever-increasing repertoire of therapeutics. This Review provides this information, summarizing the latest developments at the juncture of cardiology, oncology and haematology. Journal: Nature reviews. Cardiology. Year: 2020.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cutting the umbilical cord: Cancer stem cell-targeted therapeutics.. Abstract: Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) are a notoriously quiescent subpopulation of cells within heterogeneous tumors exhibiting self-renewal, differentiation and drug-resistant capabilities leading to tumor relapse. Heterogeneous cell populations in tumor microenvironment develop an elaborate network of signalling and factors supporting the CSC population within a niche. Identification of specific biomarkers for CSCs facilitates their isolation. CSCs demonstrate abilities that bypass immune surveillance, exhibit resistance to therapy, and induce cancer recurrence while promoting altered metabolism of the bulk tumor, thereby encouraging metastasis. The fight against cancer is prone to relapse without discussing the issue of CSCs, making it imperative for encapsulation of current studies. In this review, we provide extensive knowledge of recent therapeutics developed that target CSCs via multiple signalling cascades, altered metabolism and the tumor microenvironment. Thorough understanding of the functioning of CSCs, their interaction with different cells in the tumor microenvironment as well as current gaps in knowledge are addressed. We present possible strategies to disrupt the cellular and molecular interplay within the tumor microenvironment and make it less conducive for CSCs, which may aid in their eradication with subsequently better treatment outcomes. In conclusion, we discuss a brief yet functional idea of emerging concepts in CSC biology to develop efficient therapeutics acting on cancer recurrence and metastasis. Journal: Life sciences.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Structural insights into small-molecule KRAS inhibitors for targeting KRAS mutant cancers.. Abstract: The Kirsten rat sarcoma viral (KRAS) oncogene is the most frequently mutated isoform of RAS, associated with 85\u00a0% of RAS-driven cancers. KRAS functions as a signaling hub, participating in various cellular signaling pathways and regulating a wide range of important activities, including cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, metabolism, and migration. Despite being the most frequently altered oncogenic protein in solid tumors, over the past four decades, KRAS has historically been considered \"undruggable\" owing to a lack of pharmacologically targetable pockets within the mutant isoforms. However, improvements in drug design and development have culminated in the development of selective inhibitors for KRAS mutants. Recent developments have led to the successful targeting of the KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant through covalent inhibitors that exploit the unique cysteine residue introduced by the mutation at 12th position. These inhibitors bind covalently to C12, locking KRAS in its inactive GDP-bound state and preventing downstream signaling. Some of these inhibitors have shown encouraging results in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutant cancer patients but suffer from drug resistance, toxicity, and low therapeutic efficacy. Recently, there have been great advancements in the discovery of drugs that directly target the switch I (S-I), switch-II (S-II) and S-I/II interface sites of KRAS mutant proteins. These include KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors like AMG510 (Sotorasib) and MRTX849 (Adagrasib), which have got FDA approval for non-small cell lung cancer harboring the KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutation. There is no approved drug for cancers harboring other KRAS mutations, although efforts have expanded to target other KRAS mutations and the Switch I/II interface, aiming to disrupt KRAS-driven oncogenic signaling. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have been instrumental in optimizing the binding affinity, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties of these inhibitors, leading to the development of promising therapeutic agents like Sotorasib and Adagrasib. This review provides an overview of the KRAS pathway, KRAS binding sites, strategies for direct and indirect inhibition using small molecules, and SAR based on the co-crystal structures of inhibitors with KRAS mutants which is expected to offer new hope for patients with KRAS-driven cancers through the development of new KRAS-targeted drugs.

Abstract: Retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic target the t(15;17)(q24;q21) PML/RARA driver of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), their combination now curing over 95% patients. We report exome sequencing of 64 matched samples collected from patients at initial diagnosis, during remission, and following relapse after historical combined RA-chemotherapy treatments. A first subgroup presents a high incidence of additional oncogenic mutations disrupting key epigenetic or transcriptional regulators (primarily WT1) or activating MAPK signaling at diagnosis. Relapses retain these cooperating oncogenes and exhibit additional oncogenic alterations and/or mutations impeding therapy response (RARA, NT5C2). The second group primarily exhibits FLT3 activation at diagnosis, which is lost upon relapse together with most other passenger mutations, implying that these\u00a0relapses derive from ancestral\u00a0pre-leukemic PML/RARA-expressing cells that survived RA/chemotherapy. Accordingly, clonogenic activity of PML/RARA-immortalized progenitors ex vivo is only transiently affected by RA, but selectively abrogated by arsenic. Our studies stress the role of cooperating oncogenes in direct relapses and suggest that targeting pre-leukemic cells by arsenic contributes to its clinical efficacy. Journal: Nature communications.

Bin2cell reconstructs cells from the highest resolution data (2 \u03bcm bins) by leveraging morphology image segmentation and gene expression information. It is compatible with established Python single cell and spatial transcriptomics software, and operates efficiently in a matter of minutes without requiring a GPU. We demonstrate improvements in downstream analysis when using the reconstructed cells over default 8 \u03bcm bins on mouse brain and human colorectal cancer data.

Abstract: The human kinome is one of the most productive classes of drug target, and there is emerging necessity for treating complex diseases by means of polypharmacology (multi-target drugs and combination products). However, the advantages of the multi-target drugs and the combination products are still under debate. A comparative analysis between FDA approved multi-target drugs and combination products, targeting the human kinome, was conducted by mapping targets onto the phylogenetic tree of the human kinome. The approach of network medicine illustrating the drug-target interactions was applied to identify popular targets of multi-target drugs and combination products. As identified, the multi-target drugs tended to inhibit target pairs in the human kinome, especially the receptor tyrosine kinase family, while the combination products were able to against targets of distant homology relationship. This finding asked for choosing the combination products as a better solution for designing drugs aiming at targets of distant homology relationship. Moreover, sub-networks of drug-target interactions in specific disease were generated, and mechanisms shared by multi-target drugs and combination products were identified. In conclusion, this study performed an analysis between approved multi-target drugs and combination products against the human kinome, which could assist the discovery of next generation polypharmacology.

Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Protein information is often replaced by RNA data in studies to understand cancer-related biological processes or molecular functions, and proteins of prognostic significance in Kidney clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) remain to be mined. <b>Methods:</b> The cancer genome atlas program (TCGA) data was utilized to screen for proteins that are prognostically significant in KIRC. Machine learning algorithms were employed to develop protein prognostic models. Additionally, immune infiltration abundance, somatic mutation differences, and immunotherapeutic responses were analyzed in various protein risk subgroups. Ultimately, the validation of protein-coding genes was confirmed by utilizing an online database and implementing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). <b>Results:</b> The patients were divided into two risk categories based on prognostic proteins, and notable disparities in both overall survival (OS) and progression free interval (PFI) were observed between the two groups. The OS was more unfavorable in the high-risk group, and there was a noteworthy disparity in the level of immune infiltration observed between the two groups. In addition, the nomogram showed high accuracy in predicting survival in KIRC patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this research, we elucidated the core proteins associated with prognosis in terms of survival prediction, immunotherapeutic response, somatic mutation, and immune microenvironment. Additionally, we have developed a reliable prognostic model with excellent predictive capabilities. Journal: International journal of medical sciences. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Work over the past several decades has identified that aberrations in the ErbB signaling pathways are key drivers of oncogenesis, and concurrent efforts to discover targetable vulnerabilities to counter this aberrant oncogenic signaling offer tremendous promise in treating a host of human cancers. These efforts have been centered primarily on EGFR (also known as HER1), leading to the discovery of the first targeted therapies approved for head and neck cancer. More recently, HER2 and HER3 signaling pathways have been identified as highly dysregulated in head and neck cancer. This review highlights the HER2 and HER3 signaling pathways and clinical efforts to target these receptors and their aberrant signaling to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and other head and neck malignancies, including salivary gland carcinomas. This includes the use of small molecule inhibitors and blocking antibodies, both as single agents or as part of multimodal precision targeted and immunotherapies.

Abstract: Plectin, as the cytolinker and scaffolding protein, are widely expressed and abundant in many tissues, and has involved in various cellular activities contributing to tumorigenesis, such as cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. Due to the specific expression and differential localization of plectin in cancer, most researchers focus on the role of plectin in cancer, and it has emerged as a potent driver of malignant hallmarks in many human cancers, which provides the possibility for plectin to be widely used as a biomarker and therapeutic target in the early diagnosis and targeted drug delivery of the disease. However, there is still a lack of systematic review on the interaction molecules and mechanism of plectin. Herein, we summarized the structure, expression and function of plectin, and mainly focused on recent studies on the functional and physical interactions between plectin and its interacting molecules, shedding light on the potential of targeting plectin for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Personalized oncology aims to tailor therapy by targeting the unique genetic characteristics of a patient's tumor, whereas cancer immunotherapy focuses on activating the patient's immune system to control the tumor. The fusion of these ostensibly separate strategies has created a new dimension for personalized cancer immunotherapy. This entails the development of next-generation cancer vaccines that target neoantigens as well as the use of mutational signatures as predictive biomarkers for clinical response. The optimal use of immunotherapeutic agents will hinge on a robust understanding of the mutational profile of a cancer's genome that significantly dictates antitumor immunity and immunotherapeutic response. Cancer immunotherapy has provided substantial clinical benefit in a significant number of patients with advanced disease. However, the need for more precise immunotherapies and predictive biomarkers remains pressing. Recent progress in these areas has been promising and has created a framework for precision immune-oncology. Cancer Discov; 6(7); 703-13. \u00a92016 AACR. Journal: Cancer discovery. Year: 2016.

We assembled a genomic and transcriptomic dataset of South Korean CRC patients (KOCRC; n\u2009=\u2009126) from previous studies and European cases (EUCRC; n\u2009=\u2009245) selected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Then, we compared the two datasets in terms of clinical data, driver genes, mutational signature, gene sets, consensus molecular subtype, and fusion genes. These two cohorts showed similar profiles in driver mutations but differences in the mutation frequencies of some driver genes (including APC, TP53, PABPC1, FAT4, MUC7, HSPG2, GNAS, DENND5B, and BRAF). Analysis of hallmark pathways using genomic data sets revealed further differences between these populations in the WNT, TP53, and NOTCH signaling pathways. In consensus molecular subtype (CMS) analyses of the study cases, no BRAF mutations were found in the CMS1 subtype of KOCRC, which contrasts with previous findings. Fusion gene analysis identified oncogenic fusion of PTPRK-RSPO3 in a subset of KOCRC patients without APC mutations. This study presents insights into the genomic landscape of KOCRCs and reveals some similarities and differences with EUCRCs at the molecular level. Journal: Genes & genomics. Year: 2022.

Abstract: <b>Aim:</b> This study examines how chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy's incremental effectiveness and cost-effectiveness profile fits into the recent history of anticancer treatments. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We conducted graphical and multivariable analyses using data from the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry of the Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review's analysis of CAR-T therapies. We collected additional information including the US FDA approval years for pharmacologic innovations. <b>Results:</b> CAR-T provided 5.03 (95% CI: 3.88-6.18) more incremental quality-adjusted life-years than the average pharmaceutical intervention and 4.61 (95% CI: 1.67-7.56) more than the average nonpharmaceutical intervention, while retaining similar cost-effectiveness. There was evidence of worsening cost-effectiveness by approval year for pharmaceutical interventions. <b>Limitations:</b> Analysis is limited to anticancer treatments studied in cost-utility analyses, estimated to cover approximately 60% of FDA-approved antineoplastic agents. <b>Conclusion:</b> CAR-T therapy breaks a pattern of stagnant efficacy growth in pharmaceutical innovation and demonstrates significantly greater incremental effectiveness and similar cost-effectiveness to prior innovations.

Abstract: Despite remarkable successes in the clinic, cancer targeted therapy development remains challenging and the failure rate is disappointingly high. This problem is partly due to the misapplication of the targeted therapy paradigm to therapeutics targeting pan-essential genes, which can result in therapeutics whereby efficacy is attenuated by dose-limiting toxicity. Here we summarize the key features of successful chemotherapy and targeted therapy agents, and use case studies to outline recurrent challenges to drug development efforts targeting pan-essential genes. Finally, we suggest strategies to avoid previous pitfalls for ongoing and future development of pan-essential therapeutics. Journal: Cancer cell. Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Mechanism of relapse in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.. Abstract: Relapse following initial chemotherapy remains a barrier to survival in approximately 20% of children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recently, to investigate the mechanism of relapse, we analysed clonal populations in 27 pairs of matched diagnosis and relapse ALL samples using PCR-based detection of multiple antigen receptor gene rearrangements. These clonal markers revealed the emergence of apparently new populations at relapse in 13 patients. In those cases where the new 'relapse clone' could be detected in the diagnosis population, there was a close correlation between length of first remission and quantity of the relapse clone in the diagnosis sample. A shorter length of time to first relapse correlated with a higher quantity of the relapsing clone at diagnosis. This observation, together with demonstrated differential chemosensitivity between sub-clones at diagnosis, indicates that relapse in ALL patients may commonly involve selection of a minor intrinsically resistant sub-clone that is undetectable by routine PCR-based methods. From a clinical perspective, relapse prediction may be improved with strategies to detect minor potentially resistant sub-clones early during treatment, hence allowing intensification of therapy. Together with the availability of relevant in vivo experimental models and powerful technology for detailed analysis of patient specimens, this new information will help shape future experimentation towards targeted therapy for high-risk ALL.

Abstract: This study aimed to describe the patterns of care and outcomes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after failure of front line anthracycline-based immunochemotherapy (IC). Patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma were prospectively enrolled in Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER) of the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Specialized Program of Research Excellzence. All DLBCL and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) patients treated with front-line anthracycline-based IC were followed for relapse. Patients with relapse on follow-up and subsequently retreated were included in this analysis. 1039 patients received anthracycline-based IC between 2002 and 2012, of which 244 relapsed and were subsequently retreated. Across all therapies, overall survival at 4\u00a0years (OS4) from relapse was 28% and 103 patients ultimately underwent autologous haematopoietic cell transplant (autoHCT) with OS4 from autoHCT of 51%. Patients relapsing after 12\u00a0months from initial diagnosis had OS4 of 47% but those with a transient or no response to initial therapy had OS4 of only 13%. Outcomes of relapsed or refractory DLBCL differ substantially when categorized by response to initial therapy, timing of relapse and opportunity to undergo autoHCT. The design and interpretation of uncontrolled trials should account for this heterogeneity in patients with relapsed DLBCL. Journal: British journal of haematology. Year: 2017.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrated multiomic predictors for ovarian cancer survival.. Abstract: Increasingly affordable high-throughput molecular profiling technologies have made feasible the measurement of omics-wide interindividual variations for the purposes of predicting cancer prognosis. While multiple types of genetic, epigenetic and expression changes have been implicated in ovarian cancer, existing prognostic biomarker strategies are constrained to analyzing a single class of molecular variations. The extra predictive power afforded by the integration of multiple omics types remains largely unexplored. In this study, we performed integrative analysis on tumor-based exome-, transcriptome- and methylome-wide molecular profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for variations in cancer-relevant genes to construct robust, cross-validated multiomic predictors for ovarian cancer survival. These integrated polygenic survival scores (PSSs) were able to predict 5-year overall (OS) and progression-free survival in the Caucasian subsample with high accuracy (AUROC = 0.87 and 0.81, respectively). These findings suggest that the PSSs are able to predict long-term OS in TCGA patients with accuracy beyond that of previously proposed protein-based biomarker strategies. Our findings reveal the promise of an integrated omics-based approach in enhancing existing prognostic strategies. Future investigations should be aimed toward prospective external validation, strategies for standardizing application and the integration of germline variants. Journal: Carcinogenesis. Year: 2018.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular Docking: An Emerging Tool for Target-Based Cancer Therapy.. Abstract: Molecular docking is a structure-based computational technique that plays a major role in drug discovery. Molecular docking enhances the efficacy of determining the metabolic interaction between two molecules, i.e., the small molecule (ligand) and the target molecule (protein), to find the best orientation of a ligand to its target molecule with minimal free energy in forming a stable complex. By stimulating drug-target interactions, docking helps identify small molecules that might inhibit cancer-promoting proteins, aiding in the development of novel targeted therapies. Molecular docking enables researchers to screen vast reorganization, identifying potential anti-cancer drugs with enhanced specificity and reduced toxicity. The growing importance of molecular docking underscores its potential to revolutionize cancer treatment by accelerating the identification of novel drugs and improving clinical outcomes. As a wide approach, this computational drug design technique can be considered more effective and timesaving than other cancer treatment methods. In this review, we showcase brief information on the role of molecular docking and its importance in cancer research for drug discovery and target identification. Therefore, in recent years, it can be concluded that molecular docking can be scrutinized as one of the novel strategies at the leading edge of cancer-targeting drug discovery.

Abstract: The landscape of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) resistance is still being elucidated and the optimal subsequent therapy to overcome resistance remains uncertain. Here we present the final results of a phase Ib/IIa, open-label trial (NCT02871791) of exemestane plus everolimus and palbociclib for CDK4/6i-resistant metastatic breast cancer. The primary objective of phase Ib was to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose (100\u2009mg palbociclib, 5\u2009mg everolimus, 25\u2009mg exemestane). The primary objective of phase IIa was to determine the clinical benefit rate (18.8%, n\u2009=\u20096/32), which did not meet the predefined endpoint (65%). Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic profiling (phase Ib), objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and progression free survival (phase IIa), and correlative multi-omics analysis to investigate biomarkers of resistance to CDK4/6i. All participants were female. Multi-omics data from the phase IIa patients (n\u2009=\u200924 tumor/17 blood biopsy exomes; n\u2009=\u200927 tumor transcriptomes) showed potential mechanisms of resistance (convergent evolution of HER2 activation, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>), identified joint genomic/transcriptomic resistance features (ESR1 mutations, high estrogen receptor pathway activity, and a Luminal A/B subtype; ERBB2/BRAF mutations, high RTK/MAPK pathway activity, and a HER2-E subtype), and provided hypothesis-generating results suggesting that mTOR pathway activation correlates with response to the trial's therapy. Our results illustrate how genome and transcriptome sequencing may help better identify patients likely to respond to CDK4/6i therapies. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2024.

Abstract: In this narrative review, we summarize the role and significance of PI3K-AKTmTOR (PAM) pathway in ovarian and endometrial cancers, providing the most recent and relevant literature on the topic and addressing options for targeting PAM along with future perspectives of drug development. Alterations of the PAM-pathway are common in both endometrial and ovarian cancers, and are described in specific histology-defined subtypes. PAM seems to be involved in critical steps of endometrial and ovarian carcinogenesis, often mechanistically involved in the acquisition of a phenotype of treatment resistance, which could be targetable. However, early clinical trials with PAMinhibitors (PAMi) have provided disappointing results, particularly when non isoform-specific inhibitors were tested in unselected populations, accompanied by an adverse safety profile. Since then, more encouraging observations have been collected when targeting specific isoforms of PAM proteins with more selective drugs, resulting in encouraging activity and more manageable toxicity. Although the rationale of inhibiting the PAM-pathway has been demonstrated in several promising preclinical studies, no Phase III clinical trial is available to demonstrate a significant benefit of PAM-inhibitors. A way to manage targeted agents is to tailor their use to particular subpopulations most likely to obtain a considerable benefit, namely pursuing an individualized, precision-medicine approach.

Such cancer-enabling PPIs have become promising therapeutic targets. With technological advances in PPI modulator discovery and validation of PPI-targeting agents in clinical settings, targeting of PPI interfaces as an anticancer strategy has become a reality. Future research directed at genomics-based PPI target discovery, PPI interface characterization, PPI-focused chemical library design, and patient-genomic subpopulation-driven clinical studies is expected to accelerate the development of the next generation of PPI-based anticancer agents for personalized precision medicine. Here we briefly review prominent PPIs that mediate cancer-acquired properties, highlight recognized challenges and promising clinical results in targeting PPIs, and outline emerging opportunities.

Abstract: In recent decades, the field of systemic cancer treatment has seen remarkable changes due to advancements in the understanding of cancer's biology, immunology, and genetic makeup. As a result, individuals with late-stage cancers are now achieving survival rates that were previously unattainable. The goal of personalized cancer therapy is to enhance clinical outcomes by customizing drug treatments to suit the unique genetic and/or epigenetic profiles of each patient's tumor. This approach aims to reduce the side effects commonly associated with ineffective treatments. Advances in genetic sequencing and molecular cytogenetics have been instrumental in identifying cancer-driving mutations and epigenetic irregularities, leading to the development of specific molecular therapies. This review article highlights the progress and success of targeted molecular therapies in treating malignant melanoma, illustrating the concept of personalized cancer treatment.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Bioinformatic analysis constructs an optimal prognostic index for survival-related variables (OPISV) based on whole-genome expression data in Glioblastoma.. Abstract: Using clinical information and transcriptomic sequencing data from glioblastoma (GBM) patients in the TCGA database to perform gene-by-gene analysis that is aligned with individual patient characteristics and develop an optimal prognostic index of survival-related variables (OPISV) through iterative machine learning techniques to predict the prognosis of GBM patients. The TCGA dataset was utilized as the training dataset, while two GEO datasets served as independent validation cohorts. Initially, survival analysis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001***), differential gene expression analysis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05*), and univariate Cox regression analysis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05*) were employed to identify genes that are highly correlated with patient prognosis and exhibit significant differences in survival status. Subsequently, incorporating the non-excludable variable of age, a multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed in a stepwise manner to construct the OPISV. Finally, logistic and LASSO regressions were used to validate the association between the identified genes and patient survival. The OPISV performance is evaluated and its potential mechanisms are explored. Age, CTSD, PTPRN, PTPRN2, NSUN5, DNAJC30 and SOX21 emerged as the optimal variables through multivariate Cox regression iterations. Further analysis characterized Age, PTPRN and DNAJC30 as independent prognostic risk factors for constructing OPISV, which is validated with external GEO datasets and GEPIA database. In OPISV_high populations, significantly upregulated GABAergic synapse function was exposed. Differential genes identified from gene clustering of the GABAergic synapse pathway and gene module highly correlated with GABAergic synapse in the WGCNA analysis are pointing unequivocally to the glioma progress. OPISV is feasible for predicting patient survival, as it may serve as a potential mechanism underlying the involvement of GABAergic synapses in the progression of GBM.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Head and neck cancer: from anatomy to biology.. Abstract: The 20th century saw great advances in anatomy-based (surgery and radiotherapy) and chemotherapy approaches for treating head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and improving quality of life (QoL). However, despite these advances, the survival rate in HNSCC remains at \u223c50%. Front-line treatments often cause severe toxicity and debilitating long-term impacts on QoL. In recent decades, dramatic advances have been made in our knowledge of fundamental tumor biology and signaling pathways that contribute to oncogenesis and cancer progression. These insights are presenting unprecedented opportunities to develop more effective and less toxic treatments that are specific to particular molecular targets. This review discusses some of the major, potentially targetable, molecular pathways associated with head and neck carcinogenesis. We present the general mechanism underlying the functional components for each signaling pathway, discuss how these components are aberrantly regulated in HNSCC and describe their potential as therapeutic targets. We have restricted our discussion to \"drug-able targets\" such as oncogenes including those associated with HPV, tumor hypoxia and microRNAs and present these changes in the context of HNSCC patient care. The specific targeting of these pathways to achieve cancer control/remission and reduce toxicity is now challenging conventional treatment paradigms in HNSCC. This new \"biologic era\" is transforming our ability to target causal pathways and improve survival outcomes in HNSCC. Journal: International journal of cancer. Year: 2013.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular and genetic alterations associated with therapy resistance and relapse of acute myeloid leukemia.. Abstract: The majority of individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) respond to initial chemotherapy and achieve a complete remission, yet only a minority experience long-term survival because a large proportion of patients eventually relapse with therapy-resistant disease. Relapse therefore represents a central problem in the treatment of AML. Despite this, and in contrast to the extensive knowledge about the molecular events underlying the process of leukemogenesis, information about the mechanisms leading to therapy resistance and relapse is still limited. Recently, a number of studies have aimed to fill this gap and provided valuable information about the clonal composition and evolution of leukemic cell populations during the course of disease, and about genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression changes associated with relapse. In this review, these studies are summarized and discussed, and the data reported in them are compiled in order to provide a resource for the identification of molecular aberrations recurrently acquired at, and thus potentially contributing to, disease recurrence and the associated therapy resistance. This survey indeed uncovered genetic aberrations with known associations with therapy resistance that were newly gained at relapse in a subset of patients. Furthermore, the expression of a number of protein coding and microRNA genes was reported to change between diagnosis and relapse in a statistically significant manner. Together, these findings foster the expectation that future studies on larger and more homogeneous patient cohorts will uncover pathways that are robustly associated with relapse, thus representing potential targets for rationally designed therapies that may improve the treatment of patients with relapsed AML, or even facilitate the prevention of relapse in the first place.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Relapse rate, renal survival, and cancer morbidity in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis with renal involvement.. Abstract: Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are both frequently associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). Immunosuppressive treatment has dramatically improved outcome for these patients, but today we have to deal with the problems of relapses, cases refractory to treatment, and long-term side effects of therapy. This study comprises a consecutive series of 123 patients with WG (n=56) or MPA (n=67) with biopsy-confirmed renal involvement, followed up for a median of 55 mo (range, 0.1 to 273.2 mo). ANCA was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 97% of patients. Nearly half of the patients (46%) relapsed. There was no statistically significant difference in overall relapse rate according to type of ANCA. Renal survival was 78% in patients alive at the end of follow-up. Three variables seemed important for renal survival: serum creatinine, the titer of proteinase 3-ANCA measured by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and B thrombocyte count, at time of referral. Cancer incidence data were obtained from the population-based South Swedish Regional Tumor Registry. Standardized morbidity ratio was calculated using expected values from the health care region. We found an 11-fold increase in risk for bladder cancer in patients treated with cyclophosphamide for at least 12 mo. Skin carcinoma had the strongest relationship with azathioprine use for at least 12 mo and with corticosteroid therapy for at least 48 mo. In addition, four patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome and five had carcinoma in situ of the skin. Because the therapeutic regimen used today is not efficient enough to prevent relapses and is associated with a host of side effects, of which the risk for cancer is by far the most important, improved therapy and medical care are needed for patients with WG and MPA.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Transcriptome analysis reveals crucial oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma.. Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation and are increasingly recognized as key regulators in various diseases. This study aimed to identify the key miRNA biomarkers and decodes their regulatory mechanism involved in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) using network-based integrative multi-omics approaches. We applied Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) method on miRNA-Seq data to detect key miRNA modules that correlated with the disease traits. Then we used differential expression profile, level of gene significance, module-trait relationship, target-identification, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and survival analysis approaches to decipher LUAD critical miRNAs. Our analysis demonstrated a core set of LUAD critical miRNAs (called as LCmiRs) that comprises 33 oncogenic and 17 tumor suppressor miRNAs. These key miRNAs were then mapped to their target mRNAs through atarget-identification approach, allowing for the construction of miRNA-mRNA interaction networks that revealed critical regulatory relationships. The GSEA results showed that upregulated mRNAs, those were targets of downregulated miRNAs (i.e., tumor suppressor miRNAs), were predominantly associated with pathways related to cell division, oocyte maturation/meiosis, TGF-beta signalling pathway, and metabolic processes, while downregulated mRNAs, those were targets of upregulated miRNAs (i.e., oncogenic miRNAs), were linked to angiogenesis, negative regulation of growth, and receptor-mediated signaling. Validation of the identified oncogenic/tumor-suppressor miRNAs reported five novel miRNAs. Among these, the oncogenic miRNAs are hsa-miR-18a-3p, hsa-miR-589-3p, hsa-miR-1229-3p, and hsa-miR-3651, and tumor suppressor one is hsa-miR-618. This study provides a systematic in silico framework for identifying LUAD associated miRNAs. The discovery of five novel miRNAs highlights their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, offering valuable insights for experimental and clinical investigations in LUAD.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting apoptosis in cancer therapy.. Abstract: For over three decades, a mainstay and goal of clinical oncology has been the development of therapies promoting the effective elimination of cancer cells by apoptosis. This programmed cell death process is mediated by several signalling pathways (referred to as intrinsic and extrinsic) triggered by multiple factors, including cellular stress, DNA damage and immune surveillance. The interaction of apoptosis pathways with other signalling mechanisms can also affect cell death. The clinical translation of effective pro-apoptotic agents involves drug discovery studies (addressing the bioavailability, stability, tumour penetration, toxicity profile in non-malignant tissues, drug interactions and off-target effects) as well as an understanding of tumour biology (including heterogeneity and evolution of resistant clones). While tumour cell death can result in response to therapy, the selection, growth and dissemination of resistant cells can ultimately be fatal. In this Review, we present the main apoptosis pathways and other signalling pathways that interact with them, and discuss actionable molecular targets, therapeutic agents in clinical translation and known mechanisms of resistance to these agents.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Slow proliferation as a biological feature of colorectal cancer metastasis.. Abstract: We have recently reported an inverse relationship between colon cancer progression and tumour proliferative activity. Here, we extend our findings by evaluating the proliferative activity of liver metastatic lesions and primary colorectal cancers (CRC) that differ in their metastatic potential. Using an earlier established multi-gene proliferation signature (GPS), proliferative levels were analysed in 73 primary CRCs and 27 liver metastases. Compared with primary CRCs, we observed a significantly lower expression of the GPS in liver metastases and confirmed their lower proliferative levels by quantitative RT-PCR and Ki-67 immunostaining. No difference could be detected in apoptotic indices as assessed by M30 immunostaining, indicating that the net growth rate is lower in metastases relative to primary tumours. Notably, relapsed primaries or those with established metastases had significantly lower proliferative activity than CRCs that were non-metastatic and did not relapse. Our results suggest that slow proliferation is a biological characteristic of both liver metastases and those primary tumours with the ability to metastasise. The delineation of the mechanisms underlying the inverse association between proliferation and CRC aggressiveness may be important for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Longitudinal monitoring of patients with advanced cancers is crucial to evaluate both disease burden and treatment response. Current liquid biopsy approaches mostly rely on the detection of DNA-based biomarkers. However, plasma RNA analysis can unleash tremendous opportunities for tumor state interrogation and molecular subtyping. Through the application of deep learning algorithms to the deconvolved transcriptomes of RNA within plasma extracellular vesicles (evRNA), we successfully predicted consensus molecular subtypes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Analysis of plasma evRNA also enabled monitoring of changes in transcriptomic subtype under treatment selection pressure and identification of molecular pathways associated with recurrence. This approach also revealed expressed gene fusions and neoepitopes from evRNA. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using transcriptomic-based liquid biopsy platforms for precision oncology approaches, spanning from the longitudinal monitoring of tumor subtype changes to the identification of expressed fusions and neoantigens as cancer-specific therapeutic targets, sans the need for tissue-based sampling. The development of an approach to interrogate molecular subtypes, cancer-associated pathways, and differentially expressed genes through RNA sequencing of plasma extracellular vesicles lays the foundation for liquid biopsy-based longitudinal monitoring of patient tumor transcriptomes.

Therefore, they are considered as promising targets for the design of therapeutic strategies. Smac mimetics mimic the endogenous mitochondrial protein Smac that antagonizes IAP proteins upon its release into the cytosol. Multiple preclinical studies have documented the ability of Smac mimetics to either directly induce cell death of cancer cells or to prime them to agents that trigger cell death. At present, several Smac mimetics are being evaluated in early clinical trials. The current review provides an overview on the potential of Smac mimetics as cancer therapeutics to target IAP proteins for cancer therapy.

Abstract: This retrospective study aims at comparing the variation of peripheral inflammatory markers in recurrent and cancerous vocal fold leukoplakia (VFL) and at exploring the potential connection with pathological outcomes. The patients undergoing carbon dioxide laser surgery with postoperative pathological diagnosis of recurrent vocal fold leukoplakia in the last 5 years were included. The clinical data were collected, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocytes-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) before and after recurrence and canceration were calculated. Related comparison with two-grade pathological classification was made to evaluate their potential connection with postsurgical histopathology and clinical events. The data of 193 patients were engaged into research, as 111 in the recurrence group (Group A) and 82 in canceration group (Group B). The NLR, PLR, and MLR were significantly increased in canceration event compared to the first (<i>P</i> = 0.009, 0.004, 0.007, respectively) and penultimate (<i>P</i> = 0.013, 0.041, 0.006, respectively) time when the previous pathologies were leukoplakia. When redividing the Group A according to the two-grade pathological classification, the high-risk groups showed statistically higher NLR and PLR values than low-risk groups in the subgroups with grade changing (<i>P</i> = 0.016, 0.005, 0.007, 0.005, respectively) and subgroups without grade changing (<i>P</i> = 0.020, 0.027, 0.030, 0.029, respectively). NLR, PLR, and MLR are reliable biomarkers in the circulation system which show significantly interrelation with the pathological progression of vocal fold leukoplakia. Presurgical evaluation of NLR, PLR, and MLR may have potential values to indicate the following treatment in clinical practice. Journal: Disease markers. Year: 2020.

Abstract: Children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in low-income and middle-income countries rarely survive. The Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Association of Central America (AHOPCA) developed the AHOPCA-ALL REC 2014 protocol to improve outcomes in resource-constrained settings without access to stem cell transplantation. The AHOPCA-ALL REC 2014 protocol was based on a modified frontline induction phase 1A, a consolidation therapy with six modified R-blocks derived from the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster REZ 2002 protocol and intermittent maintenance therapy. Children with B-lineage ALL were eligible after a late medullary relapse, an early or late combined relapse, or any extramedullary relapses. Those with T-lineage ALL were eligible after early and late extramedullary relapses, as were those with both B-lineage and T-lineage relapses occurring at least 3\u00a0months after therapy abandonment. The study population included 190 patients with T-lineage (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and B-lineage (n\u00a0=\u00a0187) ALL. Of those with B-lineage ALL, 25 patients had a very early extramedullary relapse, 40 had an early relapse (32 extramedullary and 8 combined), and 125 had a late relapse (34 extramedullary, 19 combined, and 72 medullary). The main cause of treatment failure was second relapse (52.1%). The 3-year event-free survival rate (\u00b1 standard error) was 25.9%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5%, and the 3-year overall survival rate was 36.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8%. The 3-year event-free survival rate was 47.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7% for late relapses. The most frequently reported toxicity was grade 3 or 4 infection. Mortality during treatment occurred in 17 patients (8.9%), in most cases because of infectious complications. Selected children with relapsed ALL in Central America can be cured with second-line regimens even without access to consolidation with stem cell transplantation. Children in low-income and middle-income countries who have lower risk relapses of ALL should be treated with curative intent. Journal: Cancer. Year: 2023.

Abstract: MLLT10 fusion is a rare but recurrent genetic driver in acute leukemias. To better understand the genomic landscape of PICALM::MLLT10 (PM) positive acute leukemia, we performed genomic profiling and gene expression profiling in twenty PM-positive patients, including AML (n\u2009=\u200910), T-ALL/LLy (n\u2009=\u20098), Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), T/B (n\u2009=\u20091) and acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) (n\u2009=\u20091). Besides confirming the known activation of HOXA, differential gene expression analysis compared to hematopoietic stem cells demonstrated the enrichment of genes associated with cell proliferation-related pathways and relatively high expression of XPO1 in PM-AML and PM-T-ALL/LLy. Our study also suggested PHF6 disruption as a key cooperating event in PICALM::MLLT10-positive leukemias. In addition, we demonstrated differences in gene expression profiles as well as remarkably different spectra of co-occurring mutations between PM-AML and PM-T-ALL/LLy. Alterations affecting TP53 and NF1, hallmarks of PM-AML, are strongly associated with disease progression and relapse, whereas EZH2 alterations are highly enriched in PM-T-ALL/LLy. This comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic profiling provides insights into the pathogenesis and development of PICALM::MLLT10 positive acute leukemia. Journal: Leukemia. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most lethal cancers in women worldwide, and the development of efficient treatments faces several challenges. Breast cancer is characterized by histological and functional heterogeneity in aspects such as tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. RNA therapy has emerged as a highly attractive class of drugs for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. It might play remarkable regulatory roles in the treatment of targeted cells by either increasing or silencing expressions of specific proteins, and such features of RNA-based drugs cause high selectivity and low risk of off-target effect in breast cancer. RNA therapy exerts anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects upon cell culture systems, animal models, and in clinical trials in most studies. In this mini-review, we outline the classifications, mechanisms, advantages, and challenges of RNA therapy and highlight its application in breast cancer treatment. Additionally, we summarize the clinical trials of RNA-targeting therapies and the development of anti-tumor RNA drugs and provide future directions for RNA therapeutics in breast cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Late phase 1 studies: concepts and outcomes.. Abstract: Over the past two decades, targeted therapies have become cornerstone treatments for numerous cancers with oncogene addiction. Unfortunately, their effectiveness reduces over time and most patients who receive targeted therapies relapse within 12 months. The emergence of drug-resistance mechanisms in tumours paved the way for next-generation inhibitors. However, insufficient concentration of targeted therapy is a frequent but poorly explored mechanism of treatment failure. Additionally, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not always reached in phase studies, and the recommended phase 2 dose is mostly based on benefit-risk ratio and pharmacokinetic considerations, which could result in a suboptimal dose. This scenario has led us to propose a new concept in clinical drug development: the late phase 1 study. The primary goal of this type of trial is to define an alternative MTD of a drug in patients who are chronically exposed and had an initial benefit from targeted therapy but subsequently progressed without an identified resistance alteration. Intrapatient dose escalation might increase drug concentration and restore drug activity or efficacy. Journal: The Lancet. Oncology. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been increasingly popular in genomics studies over the last decade, as new sequencing technology has been created and improved. Recently, NGS started to be used in clinical oncology to improve cancer therapy through diverse modalities ranging from finding novel and rare cancer mutations, discovering cancer mutation carriers to reaching specific therapeutic approaches known as personalized medicine (PM). PM has the potential to minimize medical expenses by shifting the current traditional medical approach of treating cancer and other diseases to an individualized preventive and predictive approach. Currently, NGS can speed up in the early diagnosis of diseases and discover pharmacogenetic markers that help in personalizing therapies. Despite the tremendous growth in our understanding of genetics, NGS holds the added advantage of providing more comprehensive picture of cancer landscape and uncovering cancer development pathways. In this review, we provided a complete overview of potential NGS applications in scientific and clinical oncology, with a particular emphasis on pharmacogenomics in the direction of precision medicine treatment options.

A biomarker-driven, disease-agnostic approach to oncology drug development can maximize the reach of novel therapeutics. To date, eight drug-biomarker pairs have been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors with specific molecular profiles. Emerging biomarkers with the potential for clinical actionability across tumor types include gene fusions involving NRG1, FGFR1/2/3, BRAF, and ALK and mutations in TP53 Y220C, KRAS G12C, FGFR2/3, and BRAF non-V600 (class II). We explore the growing evidence for clinical actionability of these biomarkers in patients with advanced solid tumors. Journal: Molecular cancer therapeutics. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Immunogenomic Landscape in Breast Cancer Reveals Immunotherapeutically Relevant Gene Signatures.. Abstract: Breast cancer is characterized by some types of heterogeneity, high aggressive behaviour, and low immunotherapeutic efficiency. Detailed immune stratification is a prerequisite for interpreting resistance to treatment and escape from immune control. Hence, the immune landscape of breast cancer needs further understanding. We systematically clustered breast cancer into six immune subtypes based on the mRNA expression patterns of immune signatures and comprehensively depicted their characteristics. The immunotherapeutic benefit score (ITBscore) was validated to be a superior predictor of the response to immunotherapy in cohorts from various datasets. Six distinct immune subtypes related to divergences in biological functions, signatures of immune or stromal cells, extent of the adaptive immune response, genomic events, and clinical prognostication were identified. These six subtypes were characterized as immunologically quiet, chemokine dominant, lymphocyte depleted, wounding dominant, innate immune dominant, and IFN-\u03b3 dominant and exhibited features of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The high ITBscore subgroup, characterized by a high proportion of M1 macrophages:M2 macrophages, an activated inflammatory response, and increased mutational burden (such as mutations in TP53, CDH1 and CENPE), indicated better immunotherapeutic benefits. A low proportion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and an inadequate response to immune treatment were associated with the low ITBscore subgroup, which was also associated with poor survival. Analyses of four cohorts treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) suggested that patients with a high ITBscore received significant therapeutic advantages and clinical benefits. Our work may facilitate the understanding of immune phenotypes in shaping different TME landscapes and guide precision immuno-oncology and immunotherapy strategies. Journal: Frontiers in immunology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Wx: a neural network-based feature selection algorithm for transcriptomic data.. Abstract: Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows the simultaneous sequencing of billions of DNA fragments simultaneously, has revolutionized how we study genomics and molecular biology by generating genome-wide molecular maps of molecules of interest. However, the amount of information produced by NGS has made it difficult for researchers to choose the optimal set of genes. We have sought to resolve this issue by developing a neural network-based feature (gene) selection algorithm called Wx. The Wx algorithm ranks genes based on the discriminative index (DI) score that represents the classification power for distinguishing given groups. With a gene list ranked by DI score, researchers can institutively select the optimal set of genes from the highest-ranking ones. We applied the Wx algorithm to a TCGA pan-cancer gene-expression cohort to identify an optimal set of gene-expression biomarker candidates that can distinguish cancer samples from normal samples for 12 different types of cancer. The 14 gene-expression biomarker candidates identified by Wx were comparable to or outperformed previously reported universal gene expression biomarkers, highlighting the usefulness of the Wx algorithm for next-generation sequencing data. Thus, we anticipate that the Wx algorithm can complement current state-of-the-art analytical applications for the identification of biomarker candidates as an alternative method. The stand-alone and web versions of the Wx algorithm are available at https://github.com/deargen/DearWXpub and https://wx.deargendev.me/ , respectively. Journal: Scientific reports. Year: 2019.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeted Therapy for Cancer in the Genomic Era.. Abstract: The advent of cancer genomics has led to the development of many highly successful targeted therapies, primarily inhibitors of growth factor receptors and related kinases, including imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia and trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer. This approach has become highly successful for certain cancers. However, as the list of targeted therapies expands, their efficacy becomes more limited, and toxicity accumulates. What we have learned in the past decades is that while the targeted therapeutics approach may be highly successful in less complex tumors, cancers defined by carcinogen-induced genomic chaos, such a UV-induced melanoma or tobacco-induced lung cancer, are driven by a multitude of competing molecular pathways and, as such, are not as successfully managed by a similar approach. Luckily, in the past years, the field of cancer immunotherapy has become more fully developed with the emergence of checkpoint blockade inhibitor therapy. These promising new agents are particularly well suited for tumors with a high mutational burden due to underlying genomic disarray. While still in its infancy, we predict that cancer immunotherapy will offer a better alternative to our current targeted approach and eagerly await the results of several ongoing clinical trials that will elucidate this new direction in cancer therapy.

Abstract: Recent reports indicate that the tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in cancer development and progression, leading to a paradigm shift in the way cancer is studied and targeted. In contrast to traditional approaches, where only tumor cells are targeted for the treatment, an emerging approach is to develop therapeutics which target the tumor microenvironment while complementing or enhancing current treatments. Legumain (LGMN) is a newly identified target which is highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment and in tumor cells, and holds potential both as a biomarker and as a therapeutic target. This review will be the first to summarize the expression of LGMN in common cancers, as well as its roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. This review also discusses the current developments and future prospects of targeting LGMN through the development of DNA vaccines, azopeptides, small molecule inhibitors and LGMN activated prodrugs, highlighting the potential of LGMN as a target for cancer therapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting the multifaceted BRAF in cancer: New directions.. Abstract: Activating mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway represent driver alterations governing tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance. MAPK activation predominantly occurs through genomic alterations in <i>RAS</i> and <i>BRAF</i>. BRAF is an effector kinase that functions downstream of <i>RAS</i> and propagates this oncogenic activity through MEK and ERK. Across cancers, <i>BRAF</i> alterations include gain-of-function mutations, copy-number alterations, and structural rearrangements. In cancer patients, BRAF-targeting precision therapeutics are effective against Class I <i>BRAF</i> alterations (p.V600 hotspot mutations) in tumors such as melanomas, thyroid cancers, and colorectal cancers. However, numerous non-Class I BRAF inhibitors are also in development and have been explored in some cancers. Here we discuss the diverse forms of <i>BRAF</i> alterations found in human cancers and the strategies to inhibit them in patients harboring cancers of distinct origins. Journal: Oncotarget.

Abstract: Deconvolution is an efficient approach for detecting cell-type-specific (cs) transcriptomic signals without cellular segmentation. However, this type of methods may require a reference profile from the same molecular source and tissue type. Here, we present a method to dissect bulk proteome by leveraging tissue-matched transcriptome and proteome without using a proteomics reference panel. Our method also selects the proteins contributing to the cellular heterogeneity shared between bulk transcriptome and proteome. The deconvoluted result enables downstream analyses such as cs-protein Quantitative Trait Loci (cspQTL) mapping. We benchmarked the performance of this multimodal deconvolution approach through CITE-seq pseudo bulk data, a simulation study, and the bulk multi-omics data from human brain normal tissues and breast cancer tumors, individually, showing robust and accurate cell abundance quantification across different datasets. This algorithm is implemented in a tool MICSQTL that also provides cspQTL and multi-omics integrative visualization, available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/MICSQTL .

Thus, the development of new targeted cancer therapies based on miRNAs promise to revolutionize cancer treatment due to their increased efficacy compared to conventional chemoradiation-based therapies and hopefully to lower levels of adverse effects.

Within the studied group of 250 children with primary AML, at least one infectious complication (IC) was diagnosed in 76.0% (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009190) children including 85.1% (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009504) episodes of BI, 8.3% (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200949) - IFD and 6.6% (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200939) - VI. Among 61 patients with rel/ref AML, at least one IC was found in 67.2% (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200941) of children including 78.8% (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200978) of BI, 14.1% (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200914) of IFD and 7.1% (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20097) of VI. In all AML patients, within BI Gram-negative strains were predominant. Half of these strains were multi-drug resistant. Characteristics of IFD and VI were comparable for de novo and rel/ref AML.

Abstract: Approximately 25% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias carry the ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene. Despite their excellent initial treatment response, up to 20% of patients relapse. To gain insight into the relapse mechanisms, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism arrays for DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 18 matched diagnosis and relapse leukemias. CNAs were more abundant at relapse than at diagnosis (mean 12.5 vs 7.5 per case; P=.01) with 5.3 shared on average. Their patterns revealed a direct clonal relationship with exclusively new aberrations at relapse in only 21.4%, whereas 78.6% shared a common ancestor and subsequently acquired distinct CNA. Moreover, we identified recurrent, mainly nonoverlapping deletions associated with glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis targeting the Bcl2 modifying factor (BMF) (n=3), glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 (n=4), and components of the mismatch repair pathways (n=3). Fluorescence in situ hybridization screening of additional 24 relapsed and 72 nonrelapsed ETV6/RUNX1-positive cases demonstrated that BMF deletions were significantly more common in relapse cases (16.6% vs 2.8%; P=.02). Unlike BMF deletions, which were always already present at diagnosis, NR3C1 and mismatch repair aberrations prevailed at relapse. They were all associated with leukemias, which poorly responded to treatment. These findings implicate glucocorticoid-associated drug resistance in ETV6/RUNX1-positive relapse pathogenesis and therefore might help to guide future therapies. Journal: Blood. Year: 2011.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis, and experimental validation to reveal the target and pharmacological mechanism of DHDK in treating breast cancer.. Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Currently, most treatments involve combinations of multiple therapies. However, existing drug therapies remain limited by side effects and drug resistance. (1E,4E)- 1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)hepta- 1,4-dien- 3-one (DHDK) is a safer, potential targeted drug with strong anti-cancer activity, derived from mistletoe. However, few studies have explored its related treatment mechanisms. This study combined network pharmacology, bioinformatics, molecular docking, and experimental verification to elucidate the mechanism of action of DHDK in treating breast cancer. The SwissTargetPrediction database, Therapeutic Target Databases, and Comparative Toxicogenomics Databases were used for drug target identification. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was employed for differential gene screening. The GeneCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database, and Therapeutic Target Databases (TTD) were utilized to identify DHDK's breast cancer treatment targets. Nexus genes were identified using Cytoscape software after protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) Resource were conducted to investigateunderlying mechanisms. Target were identified through molecular docking, and the selected signaling pathway was validatedby qPCR. Comprehensive analysis yielded possible targets and mechanisms: DHDK binds to JAK1, inhibiting the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in downstream target proteins, recruiting and phosphorylating the transcription factor STAT, downregulating STAT1, and further inhibiting the downstream effector BCL2, ultimately inhibits the anti-apoptotic effect of tumor cells. Therefore, DHDK is a highly promising targeted anti-cancer drug. Clinical trial number: not applicable. Journal: Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Evolving roles of MET as a therapeutic target in NSCLC and beyond.. Abstract: Alterations in the proto-oncogene MET are associated with tumour development, invasion and metastasis across various solid cancers. Therapeutically actionable MET alterations include MET exon 14\u00a0skipping (METex14) mutations, MET amplification and/or MET overexpression and MET fusions, which vary in incidence by tumour type. In contrast to rare de novo MET alterations, acquired MET amplification and/or MET overexpression is a relatively common phenomenon that is associated with distinct clinical implications and responses to treatment. METex14 is a distinct oncogenic driver mutation in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To date, the MET tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) capmatinib, tepotinib and savolitinib have been approved for the treatment of advanced-stage METex14-mutant NSCLC. However, the treatment paradigms for MET-altered solid tumours are rapidly evolving to include diverse MET-targeted agents. Emerging data support the role of MET TKIs, anti-MET antibodies and MET-directed antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as monotherapy or in\u00a0combination with other therapies for NSCLC or other tumour types with MET amplification and/or overexpression. Indeed, in May 2025, the MET-directed ADC telisotuzumab vedotin was approved by the FDA for patients with previously treated advanced-stage nonsquamous NSCLC overexpressing MET (\u226550% of tumour cells with 3+ staining on immunohistochemistry). Understanding the unique MET-related adverse events will be crucial when incorporating these agents into daily clinical practice. In this Review, we highlight the rationale for targeting MET alterations across various solid tumour types and provide a summary of the clinical efficacy and toxicity profiles of the approved and emerging MET-targeted TKIs, monoclonal or bispecific antibodies and ADCs.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Revitalizing Cytokine-Based Cancer Immunotherapy through Advanced Delivery Systems.. Abstract: Cytokines can coordinate robust immune responses, holding great promise as therapeutics against infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. In cancer treatment, numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines have displayed promising efficacy in preclinical studies. However, their clinical application is hindered by poor pharmacokinetics, significant toxicity and unsatisfactory anticancer efficacy. Thus, while IFN-\u03b1 and IL-2 are approved for specific cancer treatments, other cytokines still remain subject of intense investigation. To accelerate the application of cytokines as cancer immunotherapeutics, strategies need to be directed to improve their safety and anticancer performance. In this regard, delivery systems could be used to generate innovative therapies by targeting the cytokines or nucleic acids, such as DNA and mRNA, encoding the cytokines to tumor tissues. This review centers on these innovative delivery strategies for cytokines, summarizing key approaches, such as gene delivery and protein delivery, and critically examining their potential and challenges for clinical translation.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Harnessing p53 for targeted cancer therapy: new advances and future directions.. Abstract: The transcription factor p53 is the most frequently impaired tumor suppressor in human cancers. In response to various stress stimuli, p53 activates transcription of genes that mediate its tumor-suppressive functions. Distinctive characteristics of p53 outlined here enable a well-defined program of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, differentiation, metabolism, autophagy, DNA repair, anti-viral response, and anti-metastatic functions, as well as facilitating autoregulation within the p53 network. This versatile, anti-cancer network governed chiefly by a single protein represents an immense opportunity for targeted cancer treatment, since about half of human tumors retain unmutated p53. During the last two decades, numerous compounds have been developed to block the interaction of p53 with the main negative regulator MDM2. However, small molecule inhibitors of MDM2 only induce a therapeutically desirable apoptotic response in a limited number of cancer types. Moreover, clinical trials of the MDM2 inhibitors as monotherapies have not met expectations and have revealed hematological toxicity as a characteristic adverse effect across this drug class. Currently, combination treatments are the leading strategy for enhancing efficacy and reducing adverse effects of MDM2 inhibitors. This review summarizes efforts to identify and test therapeutics that work synergistically with MDM2 inhibitors. Two main types of drugs have emerged among compounds used in the following combination treatments: first, modulators of the p53-regulated transcriptome (including chromatin modifiers), translatome, and proteome, and second, drugs targeting the downstream pathways such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, metabolic stress response, immune response, ferroptosis, and growth factor signaling. Here, we review the current literature in this field, while also highlighting overarching principles that could guide target selection in future combination treatments. Journal: Transcription.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Wolf in Sheep's Clothing: Taming Cancer's Resistance with Human Serum Albumin?. Abstract: Human serum albumin (HSA) has emerged as a promising carrier for nanodrug delivery, offering unique structural properties that can be engineered to overcome key challenges in cancer treatment, especially resistance to chemotherapy. This review focuses on the cellular uptake of albumin-based nanoparticles and the modifications that enhance their ability to bypass resistance mechanisms, particularly multidrug resistance type 1 (MDR1), by improving targeting to cancer cells. In our unique approach, we integrate the chemical properties of albumin, its interactions with cancer cells, and surface modifications of albumin-based delivery systems that enable to bypass resistance mechanisms, particularly those related to MDR1, and precisely target receptors on cancer cells to improve treatment efficacy. We discuss that while well-established albumin receptors such as gp60 and gp18/30 are crucial for cellular uptake and transcytosis, their biology remains underexplored, limiting their translational potential. Additionally, we explore the potential of emerging targets, such as cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), cluster of differentiation (CD36) and transferrin receptor TfR1, as well as the advantages of using dimeric forms of albumin (dHSA) to further enhance delivery to resistant cancer cells. Drawing from clinical examples, including the success of albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) and new formulations like Pazenir and Fyarro (for Sirolimus), we identify gaps in current knowledge and propose strategies to optimize albumin-based systems. In conclusion, albumin-based nanoparticles, when tailored with appropriate modifications, have the potential to bypass multidrug resistance and improve the targeting of cancer cells. By enhancing albumin's ability to efficiently deliver therapeutic agents, these carriers represent a promising approach to addressing one of oncology's most persistent challenges, with substantial potential to improve cancer treatment outcomes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Metabolic Strategies for Inhibiting Cancer Development.. Abstract: The tumor microenvironment is a complex mix of cancerous and noncancerous cells (especially immune cells and fibroblasts) with distinct metabolisms. These cells interact with each other and are influenced by the metabolic disorders of the host. In this review, we discuss how metabolic pathways that sustain biosynthesis in cancer cells could be targeted to increase the effectiveness of cancer therapies by limiting the nutrient uptake of the cell, inactivating metabolic enzymes (key regulatory ones or those linked to cell cycle progression), and inhibiting ATP production to induce cell death. Furthermore, we describe how the microenvironment could be targeted to activate the immune response by redirecting nutrients toward cytotoxic immune cells or inhibiting the release of waste products by cancer cells that stimulate immunosuppressive cells. We also examine metabolic disorders in the host that could be targeted to inhibit cancer development. To create future personalized therapies for targeting each cancer tumor, novel techniques must be developed, such as new tracers for positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan and immunohistochemical markers to characterize the metabolic phenotype of cancer cells and their microenvironment. Pending personalized strategies that specifically target all metabolic components of cancer development in a patient, simple metabolic interventions could be tested in clinical trials in combination with standard cancer therapies, such as short cycles of fasting or the administration of sodium citrate or weakly toxic compounds (such as curcumin, metformin, lipoic acid) that target autophagy and biosynthetic or signaling pathways.

Abstract: Oligonucleotide therapeutics (ONTs) represent a rapidly evolving modality for cancer treatment, capitalizing on their ability to modulate gene expression with high specificity. With more than 20 nucleic acid-based therapies that gained regulatory approval, advances in chemical modifications, sequence optimization, and novel delivery systems have propelled ONTs from research tools to clinical realities. ONTs, including siRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, saRNA, miRNA, aptamers, and decoys, offer promising solutions for targeting previously \"undruggable\" molecules, such as transcription factors, and enhancing cancer immunotherapy by overcoming tumor immune evasion. The promise of ONT application in cancer treatment is exemplified by the recent FDA approval of the first oligonucleotide-based treatment to myeloproliferative disease. At the same time, there are challenges in delivering ONTs to specific tissues, mitigating off-target effects, and improving cellular uptake and endosomal release. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ONTs in clinical trials, emerging delivery strategies, and innovative therapeutic approaches, emphasizing the role of ONTs in immunotherapy and addressing hurdles that hinder their clinical translation. By examining advances and remaining challenges, we highlight opportunities for ONTs to revolutionize oncology and enhance patient outcomes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Drug-tolerant persister cancer cells are vulnerable to GPX4 inhibition.. Abstract: Acquired drug resistance prevents cancer therapies from achieving stable and complete responses. Emerging evidence implicates a key role for non-mutational drug resistance mechanisms underlying the survival of residual cancer 'persister' cells. The persister cell pool constitutes a reservoir from which drug-resistant tumours may emerge. Targeting persister cells therefore presents a therapeutic opportunity to impede tumour relapse. We previously found that cancer cells in a high mesenchymal therapy-resistant cell state are dependent on the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 for survival. Here we show that a similar therapy-resistant cell state underlies the behaviour of persister cells derived from a wide range of cancers and drug treatments. Consequently, we demonstrate that persister cells acquire a dependency on GPX4. Loss of GPX4 function results in selective persister cell ferroptotic death in vitro and prevents tumour relapse in mice. These findings suggest that targeting of GPX4 may represent a therapeutic strategy to prevent acquired drug resistance. Journal: Nature. Year: 2017.

Although primary prostate cancers do not harbor highly recurrent targetable genomic alterations, recent reports on the genomics of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has shown multiple targetable alterations in castration-resistant prostate cancer metastatic biopsies. Therapeutic implications include targeting prevalent DNA repair pathway alterations with PARP-1 inhibition in genomically defined subsets of patients, among other genomically stratified targets. In addition, multiple recent efforts have demonstrated the promise of liquid tumor profiling (e.g., profiling circulating tumor cells or cell-free tumor DNA) and highlighted the necessary steps to scale these approaches in prostate cancer. Although still in the initial phase of precision medicine for prostate cancer, there is extraordinary potential for clinical impact. Efforts to overcome current scientific and clinical barriers will enable widespread use of precision medicine approaches for advanced prostate cancer patients. Journal: Current opinion in urology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Combined Proteomic and Genetic Interaction Mapping Reveals New RAS Effector Pathways and Susceptibilities.. Abstract: Activating mutations in RAS GTPases drive many cancers, but limited understanding of less-studied RAS interactors, and of the specific roles of different RAS interactor paralogs, continues to limit target discovery. We developed a multistage discovery and screening process to systematically identify genes conferring RAS-related susceptibilities in lung adenocarcinoma. Using affinity purification mass spectrometry, we generated a protein-protein interaction map of RAS interactors and pathway components containing hundreds of interactions. From this network, we constructed a CRISPR dual knockout library targeting 119 RAS-related genes that we screened for <i>KRAS</i>-dependent genetic interactions (GI). This approach identified new RAS effectors, including the adhesion controller RADIL and the endocytosis regulator RIN1, and >250 synthetic lethal GIs, including a potent <i>KRAS</i>-dependent interaction between <i>RAP1GDS1</i> and <i>RHOA.</i> Many GIs link specific paralogs within and between gene families. These findings illustrate the power of multiomic approaches to uncover synthetic lethal combinations specific for hitherto untreatable cancer genotypes. SIGNIFICANCE: We establish a deep network of protein-protein and genetic interactions in the RAS pathway. Many interactions validated here demonstrate important specificities and redundancies among paralogous RAS regulators and effectors. By comparing synthetic lethal interactions across <i>KRAS</i>-dependent and <i>KRAS</i>-independent cell lines, we identify several new combination therapy targets for RAS-driven cancers.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1775</i>.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Allogeneic versus autologous stem cell transplantation after relapsing following first line autologous transplantation for multiple myeloma: A systematic review.. Abstract: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) has curative potential and was previously considered by several experts superior to autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) for patients with multiple myeloma relapsing after first-line auto-SCT. The authors conducted a comprehensive literature review of English-language studies published from 1995 to October 2024. Five studies comparing allo-SCT with second auto-SCT following first line auto-SCT in multiple myeloma were included. Two additional studies comparing patients with or without a suitable allo-SCT donor after relapse were analyzed separately. Individual data from 815 patients were obtained from two large databases: the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). Data from five smaller studies (three comparing allo-vs. auto-SCT and two comparing donor vs. no-donor groups) presented via Kaplan-Meier curves were digitized using the Shiny app. Meta-analyses were performed using R 4.3.3. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were conducted in SPSS. Individual patient data analysis showed significantly longer OS in the auto-SCT group. This benefit was consistent in the three smaller studies. PFS was also superior for auto-SCT in the CIBMTR data set and the pooled smaller studies. In the two-donor vs. no-donor studies, the donor group showed better PFS, with OS also improved when data were combined. Allo-SCT after relapse from first line auto-SCT resulted in inferior OS and PFS compared to a second auto-SCT. These findings indicate that allo-SCT should no longer be recommended in patients with multiple myeloma relapsing after first line auto-SCT. Journal: Cancer. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Multidrug resistance in relapsed acute myeloid leukemia: evidence of biological heterogeneity.. Abstract: Studies of mechanisms mediating resistance to chemotherapy led to the discovery of the multidrug transporter ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1), often expressed in leukemic cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Most clinical trials evaluating the strategy of inhibiting efflux-mediated chemotherapeutic resistance have been unsuccessful, clearly indicating the need for a better approach. This study investigated the clinical relevance of 380 genes whose expression has been shown to affect the response to chemotherapy, mostly through in vitro studies, in 11 paired samples obtained at AML diagnosis and at relapse. The expression profiling of these 380 genes was performed using TaqMan-based quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Patients had a median age of 58 years at diagnosis, a median duration of complete remission of 284.5 days, and a median overall survival of 563 days. Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected at diagnosis in 4 patients, whereas 5 displayed a normal karyotype and 2 were not investigated. Hierarchical clustering shows that samples taken at diagnosis and relapse clustered in pairs for 6 patients of the 11 studied, suggesting recurrence of the same leukemic blast, whereas for the other 5 patients, the data indicate their relapse blasts arose from different origins. A patient-by-patient analysis of the paired samples led to the striking observation that each had a unique gene signature representing different mechanisms of resistance. The data underline the need for personalized molecular analysis to tailor treatment for patients with AML. Journal: Cancer. Year: 2013.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathway in biliary tract cancers: A remedial route?. Abstract: Biliary tract cancers (BTC) are aggressive tumours with a low survival rate. At the advent of the genomic era, various genetic mutations in cell signalling pathways have been incriminated in carcinogenesis. Genomic analysis studies have connected main components of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway to BTC. PI3K pathway playing a central role in cell signalling and being deregulated in various tumours has been studied as a target for chemotherapy. Novel compounds have also been identified in preclinical trials that specifically target the PI3K pathway in BTCs, but these studies have not accelerated to clinical use. These novel compounds can be examined in upcoming studies to validate them as potential therapeutic agents, as further research is required to combat the growing need for adjuvant chemotherapy to successfully battle this tumour type. Furthermore, these molecules could also be used along with gemcitabine, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil to improve sensitivity of the tumour tissue to chemotherapy. This review focuses on the basics of PI3K signalling, genetic alterations of this pathway in BTCs and current advancement in targeting this pathway in BTCs. It emphasizes the need for gene-based drug screening in BTC. It may reveal various novel targets and drugs for amelioration of survival in patients with BTC and serve as a stepping stone for further research. Journal: Journal of cellular physiology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: CREB5 reprograms FOXA1 nuclear interactions to promote resistance to androgen receptor-targeting therapies.. Abstract: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPCs) are treated with therapies that antagonize the androgen receptor (AR). Nearly all patients develop resistance to AR-targeted therapies (ARTs). Our previous work identified CREB5 as an upregulated target gene in human mCRPC that promoted resistance to all clinically approved ART. The mechanisms by which CREB5 promotes progression of mCRPC or other cancers remains elusive. Integrating ChIP-seq and rapid immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy of endogenous proteins, we report that cells overexpressing CREB5 demonstrate extensive reprogramming of nuclear protein-protein interactions in response to the ART agent enzalutamide. Specifically, CREB5 physically interacts with AR, the pioneering actor FOXA1, and other known co-factors of AR and FOXA1 at transcription regulatory elements recently found to be active in mCRPC patients. We identified a subset of CREB5/FOXA1 co-interacting nuclear factors that have critical functions for AR transcription (GRHL2, HOXB13) while others (TBX3, NFIC) regulated cell viability and ART resistance and were amplified or overexpressed in mCRPC. Upon examining the nuclear protein interactions and the impact of CREB5 expression on the mCRPC patient transcriptome, we found that CREB5 was associated with Wnt signaling and epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, implicating these pathways in CREB5/FOXA1-mediated ART resistance. Overall, these observations define the molecular interactions among CREB5, FOXA1, and pathways that promote ART resistance. Journal: eLife. Year: 2022.

Abstract: Psychopathology and personality traits may influence the course of autoimmune disorders. With this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we aimed to assess personality, stress and depression in myasthenia patients who relapse and those who remain stable or improve (non-relapsers). We collected data from 155 consecutive adult patients with confirmed MG attending the Neuromuscular Clinic, Toronto General Hospital, between March 2017 and July 2018, for this study. Patients were assessed at baseline and 6\u2009months, or at the time of MG relapse. At both visits, the patients were assessed clinically and were asked to complete self-administered questionnaires for disease severity, chronic stress and depression. Personality type was assessed at baseline only. Relapsing patients were defined as those patients with MGII score increasing by more than 5.5 points from visit 1 to visit 2. Relapsers had higher baseline scores for depression (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and the change in disease severity correlated with the change in depression score (r\u2009=\u20090.2534, p\u2009=\u20090.0015, 95% CI: 0.098 0.3961). Higher levels of stress at baseline and neuroticism predicted higher relapse rates (p\u2009=\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u2009.0001, respectively). In the linear regression model, with change of the MGII score as the dependent variable, change in depression scores (p\u2009=\u20090.0004) and age (p\u2009=\u20090.03) predicted change in disease severity. Since emotional factors and personality type may influence MG, attention to these factors might improve care in MG patients. Journal: BMC neurology. Year: 2020.

Abstract: The biology of locally radiorecurrent prostate cancer (LRR-PCa) is poorly understood. We sought to explore the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of LRR-PCa with targeted DNA sequencing and RNA expression analysis from 41 biopsy-proven LRR-PCa tumors from 36 unique patients who had a recurrence at a median interval of 84 months (IQR, 70-124 months). Genomic alteration frequencies and transcriptomic data were compared between the LRR-PCa cohort and treatment-na\u00efve patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (genomic; n = 496) and Gleason grade-at-recurrence-matched patients from the Decipher Genomics Resource for Intelligent Discovery (transcriptomic; n = 22,320). Twenty-five patients (69%) had pathologic upgrading at recurrence (17% vs 64% with Gleason grade 4-5 disease; P < .001). The LRR-PCa cohort demonstrated significantly greater single-nucleotide variations in 29 genes known to be associated with prostate cancer, including several associated with increased aggressiveness and DNA repair: FAT1 (58.5% vs 1.0%), RAD51B (36.6% vs 0.4%), POLQ (34.1% vs 1.4%), KMT2C (34.1% vs 4.9%), BRCA2 (29.3% vs 1.8%), ATRX (26.8% vs 0.8%), and BRCA1 (24.4% vs 0.4%) (Pvalues < .001 for all). The LRR-PCa cohort had a significantly higher Decipher score (median, 0.80 vs 0.66; P = .05) and demonstrated significantly greater basal subtype based on PAM50 (56% vs 20%; P < .001) and lower androgen receptor activity (61% for LRR vs 9%; P < .001). Overall, these results suggest that LRR-PCa has a distinct genomic and transcriptomic landscape from de novo prostate cancer. Specifically, LRR-PCa has an enrichment in SNVs in genes associated with tumor aggressiveness and/or DNA repair, has higher Decipher scores, a more basal subtype, and has transcriptomic evidence of lower androgen receptor activity and loss of tumor suppressor genes.

Abstract: Early-stage poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is plagued by a high risk of postoperative recurrence, and its prognostic heterogeneity complicates treatment and surveillance planning. We conducted this integrative multi-omics study to identify those patients with a truly high risk of adverse outcomes. Whole-exome, RNA and whole methylome sequencing were carried out on 101 treatment-na\u00efve early-stage poorly differentiated LUADs. Integrated analyses were conducted to disclose molecular characteristics and explore molecular subtyping. Functional validation of key molecules was carried out through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Recurrent tumors exhibited significantly higher ploidy (p\u2009=\u20090.024), the fraction of the genome altered (FGA, p\u2009=\u20090.042), and aneuploidy (p\u2009< 0.05) compared to non-recurrent tumors, as well as a higher frequency of CNVs. Additionally, recurrent tumors showed hypomethylation at both the global level and in CpG island regions. Integrative transcriptomic and methylation analyses identified three molecular subtypes (C1, C2, and C3), with the C1 subtype presenting the worst prognosis (p\u2009=\u20090.024). Although frequently mutated genes showed similar mutation frequencies across the three subtypes, the C1 subtype exhibited the highest tumor mutation burden (TMB), mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH), aneuploidy, and HLA loss of heterozygosity (HLA-LOH), along with relatively lower immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, GINS1 and CPT1C were found to promote LUAD progression, and their high expression correlated with a poor prognosis. This multi-omics study identified three integrative subtypes with distinct prognostic implications, paving the way for more precise management and postoperative monitoring of early-stage poorly differentiated LUAD.

Abstract: The application of repertoire selection technologies for the study and characterization of tumor heterogeneity is an area of great interest in the field of tumor biology and immunotherapy. Among the most promising approaches, phage display has been successfully used to select peptides and antibody fragments to a variety of different targets, including cancer cells, immune cells and cytokines. Peptides selected from phage display have been used to guide the delivery of lytic peptides, cytotoxic drugs, and nanoparticles to cancer cells with the aim to obtain more efficient and less toxic therapeutics. Additionally, antibodies developed through phage display are being used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and in some cases metastatic cancers. This review provides a short description of how phage libraries are designed, and highlights the conversion of the isolated binders into human therapeutics and use in targeted therapies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: A basis for updating our approach to resistant acute leukemia.. Abstract: No studies exist documenting that chemotherapy alone eradicates tumors composed of leukemic cells in a large group of patients with tumors at any one site. Yet, its use has continued over 40 years in the absence of data. Consensus protocols exist only for testis and meningeal tumors, relying on local therapy. To constitute a body of knowledge about tumors at one site, the breast was chosen and all published cases were analyzed, with follow-up obtained, to document the behavior of acute leukemia tumors and survival after presentation. Among 235 cases (52% published since 2000), overall survival was poor, particularly for the 43% with concurrent morphologic marrow relapse, with 66-73% one-year mortality. Only 4 of 106 patients treated with chemotherapy alone survived 4 years. The majority of AML and ALL tumors were only transiently responsive to anti-leukemia treatments, including transplant, and next relapses were as, or more, common in further tumors than in marrow. A pattern of tumors similar to the metastases of invasive lobular breast cancer was revealed. When relapse occurred in marrow, durable remission was only rarely obtained. These data suggest a potential benefit of incorporating extent of disease workup at diagnosis and relapse into prospective trials. This could yield an accurate incidence of extramedullary tumors and a means to identify occult residual disease which could lead to marrow relapse. This approach could potentially result in greater success in curing acute leukemias. Journal: American journal of hematology. Year: 2012. Authors: Cunningham I.

Abstract: Cell-based gene therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor-T, T-cell receptor-T, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapies, have transformed the treatment landscape for certain cancers, yet their efficacy in solid tumors remains limited. Next-generation therapies aim to overcome biological barriers, enhance potency and safety, and streamline development timelines through innovative approaches. Recent advances in genome editing technologies have identified hundreds of gene edits that improve T-cell functionality in preclinical models. However, the limited direct translatability of these findings and the impracticality of testing each of the individual edits in a traditional clinical trial highlight the need for more efficient strategies.This article provides an overview of genome-wide screens that identify gene knockouts and knock-ins to enhance T-cell function and the limitations with translating these results to human trials. Next, we propose a novel clinical trial design for testing multiple gene modifications simultaneously within a single T-cell infusion product. This approach would enable head-to-head evaluation of edits in an internally controlled setting, accelerating the identification of promising candidate edits. Key considerations for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, non-clinical evaluation, and clinical protocols are discussed, with an emphasis on patient safety and ethical transparency.This framework is informed by insights shared at the \"Unlocking Complex Cell-based Gene Therapies\" workshop, held on May 6, 2024. Co-hosted by Friends of Cancer Research and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, the event brought together participants from academia, the US Food and Drug Administration, and patient advocacy groups. By fostering collaboration among these stakeholders, this innovative approach aims to accelerate the development of effective cell-based therapies for complex diseases.

Abstract: The progression of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive breast carcinoma (IBC) in humans is highly variable. To better understand the relationship between them, we performed a multi-omic characterization of co-occurring DCIS and IBC lesions in a cohort of individuals. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 50 patients with co-occurring DCIS and IBC lesions were subjected to DNA-seq and whole transcriptome RNA-seq. Paired DCIS and IBC multi-omics profiles were then interrogated for DNA mutations, gene expression profiles and pathway analysis. Most small variants and copy number variations were shared between co-occurring DCIS and IBC lesions, with IBC exhibiting on average a higher degree of additional mutations. However, 36% of co-occurring lesions shared no common mutations and 49% shared no common copy number variations. The most frequent genomic variants in both DCIS and IBC were PIK3CA, TP53, KMT2C, MAP3K1, GATA3 and SF3B1, with KMT2C being more frequent in DCIS and TP53 and MAP3K1 more frequent in IBC, though the numbers are too small for definitive conclusions. The most frequent copy number variations were seen in MCL1, CKSB1 and ERBB2. ERBB2 changes were not seen in IBC unless present in the corresponding DCIS. Transcriptional profiles were highly distinct between DCIS and IBC, with DCIS exhibiting upregulation of immune-related signatures, while IBC showed significant overexpression in genes and pathways associated with cell division and proliferation. Interestingly, DCIS and IBC exhibited significant differential expression of different components of extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and regulation, with DCIS showing overexpression of ECM-membrane interaction components while IBC showed upregulation of genes associated with fibronectin and invadopodia. While most co-occurring DCIS and IBC were mutationally similar and suggestive of a common clonal progenitor, transcriptionally the lesions are highly distinct, with IBC expressing key pathways that facilitate invasion and proliferation. These results are suggestive of additional levels of regulation, epigenetic or other, that facilitate the acquisition of invasive properties during tumor evolution.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Transcriptome-wide identification and study of cancer-specific splicing events across multiple tumors.. Abstract: Dysregulation of alternative splicing (AS) is one of the molecular hallmarks of cancer, with splicing alteration of numerous genes in cancer patients. However, studying splicing mis-regulation in cancer is complicated by the large noise generated from tissue-specific splicing. To obtain a global picture of cancer-specific splicing, we analyzed transcriptome sequencing data from 1149 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas project, producing a core set of AS events significantly altered across multiple cancer types. These cancer-specific AS events are highly conserved, are more likely to maintain protein reading frame, and mainly function in cell cycle, cell adhesion/migration, and insulin signaling pathways. Furthermore, these events can serve as new molecular biomarkers to distinguish cancer from normal tissues, to separate cancer subtypes, and to predict patient survival. We also found that most genes whose expression is closely associated with cancer-specific splicing are key regulators of the cell cycle. This study uncovers a common set of cancer-specific AS events altered across multiple cancers, providing mechanistic insight into how splicing is mis-regulated in cancers. Journal: Oncotarget.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Genitourinary cancer neoadjuvant therapies: current and future approaches.. Abstract: Neoadjuvant therapies can improve tolerability, reduce tumor volume to facilitate surgery, and assess subsequent treatment response. Therefore, there is much enthusiasm for expanding the benefits of cancer therapies to the neoadjuvant setting to reduce recurrence and improve survival in patients with localized or locally advanced genitourinary (GU) cancer. This approach is clinically pertinent because these treatments are administered primarily to treatment-naive patients and can elicit the greatest drug response. In addition, the results are not impacted by other anticancer treatments. While neoadjuvant therapies have been the standard treatment for bladder cancer in the past, they are presently restricted to clinical trials for renal and prostate cancer (PCa); however, changes are imminent. Precision neoadjuvant therapies will be ushered in by biomarker-stratified neoadjuvant trials with appropriate survival endpoints and comprehensive correlative and imaging studies. This review discusses neoadjuvant studies in GU malignancies and how they inform future study design considerations. Journal: Trends in cancer. Year: 2023.

Abstract: Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and advanced differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) show fatal outcomes, unlike DTCs. Here, we demonstrate mutational landscape of 27 ATCs and 86 advanced DTCs by massively-parallel DNA sequencing, and transcriptome of 13 ATCs and 12 advanced DTCs were profiled by RNA sequencing. TERT, AKT1, PIK3CA, and EIF1AX were frequently co-mutated with driver genes (BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and RAS) in advanced DTCs as well as ATC, but tumor suppressors (e.g., TP53 and CDKN2A) were predominantly altered in ATC. CDKN2A loss was significantly associated with poor disease-specific survival in patients with ATC or advanced DTCs, and up-regulation of CD274 (PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2). Transcriptome analysis revealed a fourth molecular subtype of thyroid cancer (TC), ATC-like, which hardly reflects the molecular signatures in DTC. Furthermore, the activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway could be a potential druggable target in RAS-positive ATC. Our findings provide insights for precision medicine in patients with advanced TCs. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2019. Authors: Yoo SK, Song YS, Lee EK, Hwang J, Kim HH.

Abstract: Completion of the human genome project has revolutionised translational medicine. High-throughput technology now permits investigators to systematically interrogate the genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. It is expected that these advances will eventually be translated into new more sensitive diagnostic tests and less toxic therapeutics. A major shift is expected in clinical oncology over the next few decades as we start to move away from currently practiced, population-based approaches to personalised medicine. In this emerging approach, the molecular and pathophysiological characteristics of an individual patient and tumour will be measured and tailored therapeutic regimens will be administered based on these profiles. One of the key steps in this process will be the identification and validation of biomarkers. Whilst great advances have been made in the discovery of putative biomarkers, disappointingly few have been translated into clinically applicable assays. It is widely believed that this is due to a lack of well-designed, thorough validation studies. Here, we review the role of DNA microarrays and tissue microarrays in the validation of biomarkers in breast cancer, with emphasis on their potential application to determine mode of personalised therapy in the future.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Identifying aggressive prostate cancer foci using a DNA methylation classifier.. Abstract: Slow-growing prostate cancer (PC) can be aggressive in a subset of cases. Therefore, prognostic tools to guide clinical decision-making and avoid overtreatment of indolent PC and undertreatment of aggressive disease are urgently needed. PC has a propensity to be multifocal with several different cancerous foci per gland. Here, we have taken advantage of the multifocal propensity of PC and categorized aggressiveness of individual PC foci based on DNA methylation patterns in primary PC foci and matched lymph node metastases. In a set of 14 patients, we demonstrate that over half of the cases have multiple epigenetically distinct subclones and determine the primary subclone from which the metastatic lesion(s) originated. Furthermore, we develop an aggressiveness classifier consisting of 25 DNA methylation probes to determine aggressive and non-aggressive subclones. Upon validation of the classifier in an independent cohort, the predicted aggressive tumors are significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastases and invasive tumor stages. Overall, this study provides molecular-based support for determining PC aggressiveness with the potential to impact clinical decision-making, such as targeted biopsy approaches for early diagnosis and active surveillance, in addition to focal therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Effective treatment of glioblastoma requires crossing the blood-brain barrier and targeting tumors including cancer stem cells: The promise of nanomedicine.. Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal type of brain tumor. Both therapeutic resistance and restricted permeation of drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) play a major role in the poor prognosis of GBM patients. Accumulated evidence suggests that in many human cancers, including GBM, therapeutic resistance can be attributed to a small fraction of cancer cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs have been shown to have stem cell-like properties that enable them to evade traditional cytotoxic therapies, and so new CSC-directed anti-cancer therapies are needed. Nanoparticles have been designed to selectively deliver payloads to relevant target cells in the body, and there is considerable interest in the use of nanoparticles for CSC-directed anti-cancer therapies. Recent advances in the field of nanomedicine offer new possibilities for overcoming CSC-mediated therapeutic resistance and thus significantly improving management of GBM. In this review, we will examine the current nanomedicine approaches for targeting CSCs and their therapeutic implications. The inhibitory effect of various nanoparticle-based drug delivery system towards CSCs in GBM tumors is the primary focus of this review. Journal: Biochemical and biophysical research communications.

Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers globally, threatening global health. The deregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway has been discovered in GC and may be related to cancer development, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance. Yes-associated protein (YAP), as a downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway and a crucial co-transcription factor in the nucleus, is a promising and vital potential drug target for the treatment of GC. A series of drugs or compounds that inhibit YAP has been developed or confirmed. Therefore, this review will focus on summarizing the drugs and small-molecule inhibitors that have been reported to inhibit YAP and discuss the clinical prospects of YAP inhibitors in GC.

Abstract: Women constitute the majority of the aging United States (US) population, and this has substantial implications on cancer population patterns and management practices. Breast cancer is the most common women's malignancy, while ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecological malignancy in the US. In this review, we focus on these subsets of women's cancers, seen more commonly in postmenopausal and elderly women. In order to systematically investigate the complexity of cancer progression and response to treatment in breast and ovarian malignancies, we assert that integrated mathematical modeling frameworks viewed from a systems biology perspective are needed. Such integrated frameworks could offer innovative contributions to the clinical women's cancers community, as answers to clinical questions cannot always be reached with contemporary clinical and experimental tools. Here, we recapitulate clinically known data regarding the progression and treatment of the breast and ovarian cancers. We compare and contrast the two malignancies whenever possible in order to emphasize areas where substantial contributions could be made by clinically inspired and validated mathematical modeling. We show how current paradigms in the mathematical oncology community focusing on the two malignancies do not make comprehensive use of, nor substantially reflect existing clinical data, and we highlight the modeling areas in most critical need of clinical data integration. We emphasize that the primary goal of any mathematical study of women's cancers should be to address clinically relevant questions.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Evolving Strategies for Therapeutically Targeting Cancer Stem Cells.. Abstract: Cancer is a multifactor and multistep process that is affected intrinsically by the genetic and epigenetic makeup of tumor cells and extrinsically by the host microenvironment and immune system. A key component of cancer involves a unique subpopulation of highly malignant cancerous cells referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are positioned at the apex of the tumor hierarchy with an ability to both self-renew and also generate non-CSC/differentiated progeny, which contribute to the majority of the tumor mass. CSCs undergo functional changes and show plasticity that is stimulated by specific microenvironmental cues and interactions in the tumor niche, which contribute to the complexity and heterogeneity of the CSC population. The prognostic value of CSCs in the clinic is evident since there are many examples in which CSCs serve as markers for poor patient prognosis. CSCs are innately resistant to many standard therapies and they display anoikis resistance, immune evasion, tumor dormancy, and field cancerization, which may result in metastasis and relapse. Many academic laboratories and biotechnology companies are currently focusing on strategies that target CSCs. Combination therapies, epigenetic modifiers, stemness inhibitors, CSC surface marker-based therapies, and immunotherapy-based CSC-targeting drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials. Potential new targets/strategies in CSC-targeted therapy include MDA-9/Syntenin (SDCBP), Patched (PTCH), epigenetic targets, noncoding RNAs, and differentiation induction. Defining ways of targeting and destroying CSCs holds potential to impact significantly on cancer therapy, including prevention of metastasis and cancer recurrence.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell support for germ cell tumors: a critical review.. Abstract: High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem-cell support (ASCS) has been investigated in patients with cisplatin-resistant, relapsed, or poor-prognosis germ cell tumor (GCT). Although some of these patients have benefited from this approach, it is unknown when best to administer such therapy. This review categorizes the HDC/ASCS trials into those performed as (1) salvage therapy for second or greater relapse, (2) salvage therapy for first relapse, and (3) first-line therapy. From the trials performed to date, earlier use of HDC/ASCS (first-line or salvage therapy in first relapse) achieved a higher durable remission rate than when used later as salvage therapy in second or greater relapse (approximately 50% v 15%, respectively). HDC/ASCS is not beneficial for relapsed or cisplatin-resistant primary extragonadal GCT patients, but may have a role in testicular GCT who are not \"absolutely\" cisplatin-resistant. Trial differences regarding the patients selected and the high-dose transplant preparative regimen used have made precise comparative analyses difficult. There has been only one phase III trial and it did not show a survival advantage to the HDC/ASCS arm, although this trial had significant methodological difficulties. In the future, more definitive treatment recommendations may be made upon completion of two ongoing phase III trials comparing HDC/ASCS with standard chemotherapy in the first salvage and front-line settings.

Abstract: Over the last decades, transcriptome profiling emerged as one of the most powerful approaches in oncology, providing prognostic and predictive utility for cancer management. The development of novel technologies, such as revolutionary next-generation sequencing, enables the identification of cancer biomarkers, gene signatures, and their aberrant expression affecting oncogenesis, as well as the discovery of molecular targets for anticancer therapies. Transcriptomics contribute to a change in the holistic understanding of cancer, from histopathological and organic to molecular classifications, opening a more personalized perspective for tumor diagnostics and therapy. The further advancement on transcriptome profiling may allow standardization and cost reduction of its analysis, which will be the next step for transcriptomics to become a canon of contemporary cancer medicine.

Abstract: The vast majority of ovarian cancer relapses on front-line therapy and the optimal treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer remains controversial. This review is based on the relevant published literature indexed in PubMed on pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), either alone or in combination with other drugs, as one option in relapsed disease. PLD showed an improved pharmacokinetic profile, with a slower plasma clearance and a longer circulation time, compared to other conventional doxorubicin formulations. PLD is considered to have little potential for cardiotoxicity, even at prolonged and high cumulative doses, although there appears to be room for improvement in terms of maximal dose allowed. Notwithstanding, there remain some concerns about cardiac safety, and patient monitoring is generally advocated. No data are available on the possibility to rechallenge PLD treatment in recurrent ovarian cancer, as already known for other drugs. Optimization of treatment regimens with PLD will allow a more rational treatment in advanced ovarian cancers for which few therapeutic options are available. Journal: Tumori. Year: 2019.

Abstract: Neuroblastoma (NB) remains associated with high mortality and low initial response rate, especially for high-risk patients, thus warranting exploration of molecular markers for precision risk classifiers. Through integrating multiomics profiling, we identified a range of hub genes involved in cell cycle and associated with dismal prognosis and malignant cells. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing revealed that a subset of malignant cells, subcluster 1, characterized by high proliferation and dedifferentiation, was strongly correlated with the hub gene signature and orchestrated an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, we constructed a robust malignant subcluster 1 related signature (MSRS), which was an independent prognostic factor and superior to other clinical characteristics and published signatures. Besides, TME differences conferred remarkably distinct therapeutic responses between high and low MSRS groups. Notably, polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1) was one of the most crucial contributors to MSRS and remarkably correlated with malignant subcluster 1, and PLK1 inhibition was effective for NB treatment as demonstrated by <i>in silico</i> analysis and <i>in vitro</i> experiments. Overall, our study constructs a novel molecular model to further guide the clinical classification and individualized treatment of NB. Journal: Journal of proteome research. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer remains a major cause of cancer mortality, with limited sensitivity in current diagnostics. Aberrant DNA methylation in expression-regulating sites shows biomarker potential, though few studies explore such methylation-based diagnostic tools for colorectal cancer. We conducted genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA sequencing on matched colorectal cancer and normal tissues to identify expression-related differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs). Diagnostic models were constructed with training and validation sets of 689 samples. Machine learning techniques (random forest, elastic net, support vector machine) were employed to identify optimal diagnostic markers. Methylation-specific PCR confirmed marker-host gene regulatory relationships, and targeted bisulfite sequencing validated these markers in an independent cohort of 200 samples. Host genes roles in colorectal cancer pathogenesis were further investigated through in vivo and in vitro assays and tissue microarray analysis. We identified 64,824 DMCs in colorectal cancer, with 442 associated with gene expression. These sites impact transcription factor binding, and their host genes are linked to chemotherapy resistance. Diagnostic panels showed high efficacy, with methylation changes significantly impacting RNA and protein expression of host genes. Markers cg16851417, cg19498960, and cg16302790 were validated in blood for noninvasive screening. Clustering expression-related DMCs with similar methylation patterns may facilitate diagnostic tools development. Host genes SIM2, PDX1, and TNS4 influence colorectal cancer progression and may impact therapy response. Expression-related DMCs hold strong potential as colorectal cancer biomarkers, with implications for prognosis and therapy. The specific expression patterns of these DMCs in host genes support development of non-invasive blood-based diagnostic tools. Journal: Archives of toxicology. Year: 2025.

It may be directly oncogenic, through promotion of mucosal inflammation or systemic dysregulation, or may alter anti-cancer immunity/therapy. Microorganisms within, adjacent to and distant from tumors may affect cancer progression, and interactions and differences between these populations can influence the course of disease. Here we review the microbiome as it pertains to cancer for clinicians. The microbiota of cancers including colorectal, pancreas, breast and prostate are discussed. We examine \"omics\" technologies, microbiota associated with tumor tissue and tumor-site fluids such as feces and urine, as well as indirect effects of the gut microbiome. We describe roles of the microbiome in immunotherapy, and how it can be modulated to improve cancer therapeutics. While research is still at an early stage, there is potential to exploit the microbiome, as modulation may increase efficacy of treatments, reduce toxicities and prevent carcinogenesis.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Importance of targeting various cell signaling pathways in solid cancers.. Abstract: Most adult human cancers are solid tumors prevailing in vital organs and lead to mortality all over the globe. Genetic and epigenetic alterations in cancer genes or genes of associated signaling pathways impart the most common characteristic of malignancy, that is, uncontrolled proliferation. Unless the mechanism of action of these cells signaling pathways (involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and the maintenance of the stemness of cancer stem cells and cancer microenvironment) and their physiologic alteration are extensively studied, it is challenging to understand tumorigenesis as well as develop new treatments and precision medicines. Targeted therapy is one of the most promising strategies for treating various cancers. However, cancer is an evolving disease, and most patients develop resistance to these drugs by acquired mutations or mediation of microenvironmental factors or due to tumor heterogeneity. Researchers are striving to develop novel therapeutic options like combinatorial approaches targeting multiple responsible pathways effectively. Thus, in-depth knowledge of cell signaling and its components remains a critical topic of cancer research. This chapter summarized various extensively studied pathways in solid cancer and how they are targeted for therapeutic strategies. Journal: International review of cell and molecular biology.

Metastatic cancers are the leading cause of death for advanced cancer patients. Those with advanced cancer with osteolytic-type bone metastases have a significantly lower quality of life. A novel treatment plan is needed now more than ever for breast cancer patients with bone metastases. There are shreds of evidence that cancer cells in the bloodstream interact with the bone microenvironment and that this interaction is a contributing component to breast cancer progression. Preventing any stage of this cycle can result in anti-metastasis effects. Since RANKL interacts with its receptor RANK and plays an important role in the vicious cycle, it has proven to be a successful therapeutic target in cancer treatment. As a result, we have presented a complete overview of the RANK pathway in cancer and discussed RANK signaling and tumor microenvironment, and potential therapeutic approaches in this review.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The promise of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of colorectal cancer.. Abstract: Recently, deregulation of protein synthesis has begun to gain attention as a major player in cancer development and progression. Specifically, deregulation of the process of translation initiation appears to play a key role in oncogenesis. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is vital for cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation and thus an attractive therapeutic target in oncology. Accordingly, several mTOR inhibitors are currently being tested in many cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). In this review, the key components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, their molecular alterations and the inhibitors targeting the mTOR pathway in CRC are described. Complex interactions with other pathways such as the MAPK pathway are analyzed, as are possible drug combinations that target this pathway. In addition, novel strategies for use of mTOR pathway inhibitors in CRC treatment are introduced. Clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors have been investigated in CRC. mTOR inhibitors may represent an attractive antitumor target in combination with strategies to target other pathways that may overcome resistance. Further research is needed to identify critical molecular effector mechanisms, molecular markers that predict responsiveness and potential toxicities.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: A comparative study of multi-omics integration tools for cancer driver gene identification and tumour subtyping.. Abstract: Oncogenesis and cancer can arise as a consequence of a wide range of genomic aberrations including mutations, copy number alterations, expression changes and epigenetic modifications encompassing multiple omics layers. Integrating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic datasets via multi-omics analysis provides the opportunity to derive a deeper and holistic understanding of the development and progression of cancer. There are two primary approaches to integrating multi-omics data: multi-staged (focused on identifying genes driving cancer) and meta-dimensional (focused on establishing clinically relevant tumour or sample classifications). A number of ready-to-use bioinformatics tools are available to perform both multi-staged and meta-dimensional integration of multi-omics data. In this study, we compared nine different integration tools using real and simulated cancer datasets. The performance of the multi-staged integration tools were assessed at the gene, function and pathway levels, while meta-dimensional integration tools were assessed based on the sample classification performance. Additionally, we discuss the influence of factors such as data representation, sample size, signal and noise on multi-omics data integration. Our results provide current and much needed guidance regarding selection and use of the most appropriate and best performing multi-omics integration tools. Journal: Briefings in bioinformatics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Emerging oncogene ATAD2: Signaling cascades and therapeutic initiatives.. Abstract: ATAD2 is a promising oncoprotein with tumor-promoting functions in many cancers. It is a valid cancer drug-target and a potential cancer-biomarker for multiple malignancies. As a cancer/testis antigen (CTA), ATAD2 could also be a probable candidate for immunotherapy. It is a unique CTA that belongs to both AAA+ ATPase and bromodomain family proteins. Since 2007, several research groups have been reported on the pleiotropic oncogenic functions of ATAD2 in diverse signaling pathways, including Rb/E2F-cMyc pathway, steroid hormone signaling pathway, p53 and p38-MAPK-mediated apoptotic pathway, AKT pathway, hedgehog signaling pathway, HIF1\u03b1 signaling pathway, and Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) pathway in various cancers. In all these pathways, ATAD2 participates in chromatin dynamics, DNA replication, and gene transcription, demonstrating its role as an epigenetic reader and transcription factor or coactivator to promote tumorigenesis. However, despite the progress, an overall mechanism of ATAD2-mediated oncogenesis in diverse origin is elusive. In this review, we summarize the accumulated evidence to envision the overall ATAD2 signaling networks during carcinogenesis and highlight the area where missing links await further research. Besides, the structure-function aspect of ATAD2 is also discussed. Since the efforts have already been initiated to explore targeted drug molecules and RNA-based therapeutic alternatives against ATAD2, their potency and prospects have been elucidated. Together, we believe this is a well-rounded review on ATAD2, facilitating a new drift in ATAD2 research, essential for its clinical implication as a biomarker and/or cancer drug-target.

Abstract: Successful immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy occurs in only a fraction of melanoma patients, and yet all patients are susceptible to potentially serious ICI-related side-effects. No current biomarkers robustly predict ICI treatment response in melanoma patients. In this study we sought to identify methylome and transcriptome markers which have the potential to predict immunotherapy response in melanoma patients ahead of treatment with anti-PD1 ICI monotherapy. Using Infinium MethylationEPIC microarrays, we analysed DNA methylation profiles of >850,000 CpG sites in pre-treatment melanoma tissues from patients administered anti-PD-1 monotherapy as first-line treatment. In addition, we analysed transcriptomes using RNA-seq. DNA methylation and gene expression data were then statistically compared to patient response to anti-PD1 therapy. We identified 2579 DNA hypomethylation and hypermethylation alterations correlating with melanoma response to anti-PD1 therapy. An integrative analysis of DNA methylomes and transcriptomes identified a subset of 35 loci, 13 of which were significantly differentially methylated in both initial discovery and external validation datasets. Functional enrichment analysis of hypomethylated sites (p-value <0.05) in non-responders was associated with \"Formation of the cornified envelope\", \"Regulation of epithelial cell proliferation\", and \"Purine-containing compound metabolic process\". We have identified novel integrated DNA methylation and gene expression markers, which correlate with anti-PD1 treatment response in melanoma patients. These findings suggest a relationship between tumour-associated genomic DNA methylation, gene expression patterns, and anti-PD1 ICI immunotherapy response in melanoma patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Link synthetic lethality to drug sensitivity of cancer cells.. Abstract: Synthetic lethal (SL) interactions occur when alterations in two genes lead to cell death but alteration in only one of them is not lethal. SL interactions provide a new strategy for molecular-targeted cancer therapy. Currently, there are few drugs targeting SL interactions that entered into clinical trials. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the link between SL interactions and drug sensitivity of cancer cells systematically for drug development purpose. We identified SL interactions by integrating the high-throughput data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, small hairpin RNA data and genetic interactions of yeast. By integrating SL interactions from other studies, we tested whether the SL pairs that consist of drug target genes and the genes with genomic alterations are related with drug sensitivity of cancer cells. We found that only 6.26%\u223c34.61% of SL interactions showed the expected significant drug sensitivity using the pooled cancer cell line data from different tissues, but the proportion increased significantly to approximately 90% using the cancer cell line data for each specific tissue. From an independent pharmacogenomics data of 41 breast cancer cell lines, we found three SL interactions (ABL1-IFI16, ABL1-SLC50A1 and ABL1-SYT11) showed significantly better prognosis for the patients with both genes being altered than the patients with only one gene being altered, which partially supports the SL effect between the gene pairs. Our study not only provides a new way for unraveling the complex mechanisms of drug sensitivity but also suggests numerous potentially important drug targets for cancer therapy.

Abstract: M1a disease represents an intermediate status between loco-regional relapse and bone metastatic disease. Metastasis directed therapy (MDT), through stereotactic body RT (SBRT) may be offered to patients, aiming to exclusively treat sites of macroscopic relapse and avoiding wide prophylactic treatment volumes. This appears as a viable treatment, especially after the rise of PSMA tailored treatment approaches. Data about patients treated in two different institutions were retrieved from a prospectively collected dataset. All included patients were affected by oligo-recurrent M1a disease after definitive RT or radical prostatectomy, defined as\u2009\u2264\u20093 nodal lesions situated above aortic bifurcation and below renal arteries. Both castration resistant PCa (CRPC) and castration sensitive (CSPC) PCa patients were included. All imaging methods were allowed to detect recurrence (CT scan, Choline or PSMA PET/CT).All sites of recurrences were treated with SBRT. Median PFS was 10\u00a0months (95% CI 8-17). Twelve patients died, with a median OS of 114\u00a0months (95% CI 85-114). Out of the 83 recurrences, 2 (2.4%), 11 (13.25%), 36 (43.37%) and 15 (18%) patients had respectively prostate bed only, pelvic nodal, para-aortic or distant relapse. Furthermore, 19 (22.9%) patients experienced a biochemical only relapse with negative imaging at re-staging. MDT conferred a remarkable PFS outcome in a mixed cohort of CSPC and CRPC patients with m1a disease, with an optimal safety profile. Prospective trials are needed in order to compare MDT and ENRT for these patients, allowing to select the best treatment option. Journal: La Radiologia medica. Year: 2023.

Abstract: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a malignant tumor with a poor prognosis, predominantly CA19-9 positive. High CA19-9 levels correlate with increased aggressiveness and worse outcomes. This study employs multi-omics analysis to reveal molecular features and identify therapeutic targets of CA19-9 positive ICC, aiming to support individualized treatment. Data from seven clinical cohorts, two whole-exome sequencing cohorts, six RNA sequencing/microarray cohorts, one proteomic cohort, 20 single-cell RNA sequencing samples, and one spatial transcriptome sample were analyzed. Key findings were validated on tissue microarrays from 52 ICC samples. CA19-9 positive ICC exhibited poorer OS (median 24.1 v.s. 51.5\u00a0months) and RFS (median 11.7 v.s. 28.2\u00a0months) compared to negative group (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Genomic analysis revealed a higher KRAS mutation frequency in the positive group and a greater prevalence of IDH1/2 mutations in the negative group (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Transcriptomic analysis indicated upregulated glycolysis pathways in CA19-9 positive ICC. Single-cell analysis identified specific glycolysis-related cell subclusters associated with poor prognosis, including Epi_SLC2A1, CAF_VEGFA, and Mph_SPP1. Higher hypoxia in the CA19-9 positive group led to metabolic reprogramming and promoted these cells' formation. These cells formed interactive communities promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. Drug sensitivity analysis identified six potential therapeutic drugs. This study systematically elucidated the clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and immune features of CA19-9 positive ICC. It reveals glycolysis-associated cellular communities and their cancer-promoting mechanisms, enhancing our understanding of ICC and laying the groundwork for individualized therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: A total of 29 evaluable patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) either in relapse or resistant to initial induction daunorubicin-containing chemotherapy were given a salvage regimen consisting of moderate-dose cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone. There were 8 (28%) complete responders (CRs), 4 (14%) partial responders (PRs), and 17 (52%) nonresponders. The duration of CRs was 2+, 2+, 3+, 3, 4+, 4, 5 and 6 months respectively. Two of the eight CR patients were refractory to initial daunorubicin-containing induction therapy and another two had achieved a previous CR lasting less than 6 months. Four of the eight CR patients had received an amsacrine-containing salvage regimen (ATA) prior to administration of the present moderate-dose cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone regimen; this indicates the lack of absolute clinical cross-resistance between the present combination and the daunorubicin- or amsacrine-containing regimens. However, the duration of CRs achieved by these patients remains very short and should, if possible, be followed by allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation.

Abstract: We assessed the long-term results of autologous stem-cell transplantation for patients with first-relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma included in the prospective Lymphoma Study Association/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Greffe de Moelle H96 trial. This large multicenter phase II trial evaluated a risk-adapted strategy with single or tandem autologous stem-cell transplantation for 245 Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Poor-risk patients (n=150) had primary refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (n=77) or \u22652 risk factors at first relapse (n=73) and were eligible for tandem autologous stem-cell transplantation. Intermediate-risk patients (n=95) had one risk factor at first relapse and were eligible for single autologous stem-cell transplantation. With a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 10-year freedom from second failure and overall survival rates were, respectively: 64% (95% CI, 54% to 74%) and 70% (95% CI, 61% to 80%) for the intermediate-risk group, and 41% (95% CI, 33% to 49%) and 47% (95% CI, 39% to 55%) for the poor-risk group. Considering only patients who did not relapse after completing autologous stem-cell transplantation, the 15-year cumulative incidences of second primary malignancies were 24% for the 70 intermediate-risk patients and 2% for the 75 poor-risk ones. With long-term follow-up, the risk-adapted strategy remains appropriate. Tandem autologous stem-cell transplantation can still be considered an option for poor-risk patients, but integration of positron-emission tomography findings and new drugs may help to refine the need for a second autologous stem-cell transplant and possibly improve outcomes of patients with first-relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.

The fusion PML/RAR gene provided the rationale for using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as differentiation therapy. The standard approach is antracycline + ATRA and no ARA-C. Anthracycline based chemotherapy, no high dose ARA-C and perhaps no ARA-C. Maintenance seems to be important. Cure with ATRA + chemotherapy increased to 75% from 35% with chemotherapy alone. WBC >10,000, age >55, platelets <40,000 and CD 56 expression. Achieving and maintaining a molecular remission (MCR) i.e. RT-PCR (-) for PML/RAR alpha expression, is the best predictor for cure. Conversion to PCR (+) will eventually result in relapse. PCR monitoring in the first 2 years and intervention during molecular relapse would be safer than treatment in clinical relapse. Molecular relapses have been treated successfully by ATRA plus BMT. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) or gentuzumab (mylotarg) are also being studied. Patients after ATRA in first CR are less likely to respond to ATRA reinduction regardless of the time off ATRA and rarely achieve a molecular remission. Single-agent ATO induced in 52 relapsed patients CR of 87% (75% MCR) with low toxicity and no treatment related deaths (U.S. pivotal trial), confirmed in a NCI trial. Induction of relapsing patients with single agent ATO is preferable than ATRA + chemotherapy because the high molecular remission and lower toxicity. No standard approach and the role of chemotherapy is unknown. ATO alone: in the pivotal trial, 9/21 patients had long remissions without other therapy. BMT: Not indicated in 1st MCR. In young patients auto BMT with PCR (-) harvests could be done in subsequent CR. Allo BMT has a higher death rate without overall better results. In the pivotal trial 12 patients were transplanted in CR after ATO alone (9 allo BMT) and 11 still without disease. Possibly allo BMT is safer after a less toxic ATO induction. ATO plus ATRA +/- AntiCD33 conjugated with toxin (gentuzumab) or 131I; Synthetic retinoid (Am80); histone deacetylase inhibitors; oral tetra-arsenic tetra-sulfide and various combinations.

Abstract: Non-Sanger-based novel nucleic acid sequencing techniques, referred to as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), provide a rapid, reliable, high-throughput, and massively parallel sequencing methodology that has improved our understanding of human cancers and cancer-related viruses. NGS has become a quintessential research tool for more effective characterization of complex viral and host genomes through its ever-expanding repertoire, which consists of whole-genome sequencing, whole-transcriptome sequencing, and whole-epigenome sequencing. These new NGS platforms provide a comprehensive and systematic genome-wide analysis of genomic sequences and a full transcriptional profile at a single nucleotide resolution. When combined, these techniques help unlock the function of novel genes and the related pathways that contribute to the overall viral pathogenesis. Ongoing research in the field of virology endeavors to identify the role of various underlying mechanisms that control the regulation of the herpesvirus biphasic lifecycle in order to discover potential therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. In this review, we have complied the most recent findings about the application of NGS in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) biology, including identification of novel genomic features and whole-genome KSHV diversities, global gene regulatory network profiling for intricate transcriptome analyses, and surveying of epigenetic marks (DNA methylation, modified histones, and chromatin remodelers) during de novo, latent, and productive KSHV infections.

Abstract: Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are biologically and clinically heterogeneous. Here, we use a multi-omics approach to uncover the molecular factors underlying this heterogeneity. Transcriptomic analysis of 84 PNEN specimens, drawn from two cohorts, is substantiated with proteomic profiling and identifies four subgroups: Proliferative, PDX1-high, Alpha cell-like and Stromal/Mesenchymal. The Proliferative subgroup, consisting of both well- and poorly differentiated specimens, is associated with inferior overall survival probability. The PDX1-high and Alpha cell-like subgroups partially resemble previously described subtypes, and we further uncover distinctive metabolism-related features in the Alpha cell-like subgroup. The Stromal/Mesenchymal subgroup exhibits molecular characteristics of YAP1/WWTR1(TAZ) activation suggestive of Hippo signaling pathway involvement in PNENs. Whole-exome sequencing reveals subgroup-enriched mutational differences, supported by activity inference analysis, and identifies hypermorphic proto-oncogene\u00a0variants in 14.3% of sequenced PNENs. Our study reveals differences in cellular signaling axes that provide potential directions for PNEN patient stratification and treatment strategies. Journal: Cell reports. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Advances in large-scale tumor sequencing have led to an understanding that there are combinations of genomic and transcriptomic alterations specific to tumor types, shared across many patients. Unfortunately, computational identification of functionally meaningful and recurrent alteration patterns within gene/protein interaction networks has proven to be challenging. We introduce a novel combinatorial method, cd-CAP (combinatorial detection of conserved alteration patterns), for simultaneous detection of connected subnetworks of an interaction network where genes exhibit conserved alteration patterns across tumor samples. Our method differentiates distinct alteration types associated with each gene (rather than relying on binary information of a gene being altered or not) and simultaneously detects multiple alteration profile conserved subnetworks. In a number of The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets, cd-CAP identified large biologically significant subnetworks with conserved alteration patterns, shared across many tumor samples.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Computed cancer interactome explains the effects of somatic mutations in cancers.. Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in almost all essential cellular processes. Perturbation of PPI networks plays critical roles in tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and metastasis. While numerous high-throughput experiments have produced a vast amount of data for PPIs, these data sets suffer from high false positive rates and exhibit a high degree of discrepancy. Coevolution of amino acid positions between protein pairs has proven to be useful in identifying interacting proteins and providing structural details of the interaction interfaces with the help of deep learning methods like AlphaFold (AF). In this study, we applied AF to investigate the cancer protein-protein interactome. We predicted 1,798 PPIs for cancer driver proteins involved in diverse cellular processes such as transcription regulation, signal transduction, DNA repair, and cell cycle. We modeled the spatial structures for the predicted binary protein complexes, 1,087 of which lacked previous 3D structure information. Our predictions offer novel structural insight into many cancer-related processes such as the MAP kinase cascade and Fanconi anemia pathway. We further investigated the cancer mutation landscape by mapping somatic missense mutations (SMMs) in cancer to the predicted PPI interfaces and performing enrichment and depletion analyses. Interfaces enriched or depleted with SMMs exhibit different preferences for functional categories. Interfaces enriched in mutations tend to function in pathways that are deregulated in cancers and they may help explain the molecular mechanisms of cancers in patients; interfaces lacking mutations appear to be essential for the survival of cancer cells and thus may be future targets for PPI modulating drugs.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: A systematic literature review on clonal evolution events preceding relapse in multiple myeloma.. Abstract: Despite considerable treatment advances, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable hematological cancer due to treatment resistance. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify determinants for clonal evolution driving relapse and drug resistance in MM. A total of 631 non-duplicate publications were screened of which 28 articles were included for data extraction. Genetic alterations, mutational signatures, evolutionary trajectories, and non-genetic determinants were identified as key topics to characterize clonal evolution in relapsed MM. A variety of factors led to clonal diversification and increased tumor mutation burden, such as MAPK-Ras mutations and incremental changes related to chromosomal bands 1 and 17, while mutational signature analyses revealed that APOBEC activity and melphalan treatment leave a distinct impact on the clonal composition in MM genomes. To capture and dissect tumor heterogeneity, our review suggests combining methods or using technical approaches with high resolution to assess the impact of clonal evolution.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cabazitaxel - A Treatment Option in Recurrent Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer.. Abstract: Treatment of recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer remains challenging due to the development of resistance to chemotherapy. Cabazitaxel is a new taxane that has demonstrated beneficial effect in prostate cancer patients resistant to docetaxel. Therefore, it could be anticipated to possibly also have an effect on chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer. Twenty-six patients with chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer were treated with cabazitaxel at a dose of 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (on day 1 of each 3-week cycle), until progression or inacceptable toxicity, between September 2015 and April 2018. The fraction of patients without progression after three months of treatment was the primary endpoint. Prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was prescribed to all patients. The median number of cabazitaxel infusions was 4 (range=1-18). In general, cabazitaxel was well-tolerated. The fraction of patients alive and without progression after 3 months of treatment was 54% (14/26). The response rate was 46% (12/26) according to the Gynecological Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria for CA125. Partial response (PR), evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), was found in 4/26 patients (15%). By intention-to-treat analysis, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.9 months (95% CI=1.9-4.4) using the combination of CA125 or RECIST (whichever came first), while the median overall survival (OS) was 8.4 months (95% CI=5.1-11.0). Cabazitaxel holds promise as a drug in recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. It demonstrated efficacy and in general, the toxicity was manageable. Journal: Anticancer research. Year: 2020.

Abstract: Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)+ breast cancer is considered the most dangerous type of breast cancers. Herein, we used bioinformatics methods to identify potential key genes in HER2+ breast cancer to enable its diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction. Datasets of HER2+ breast cancer and normal tissue samples retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases were subjected to analysis for differentially expressed genes using R software. The identified differentially expressed genes were subjected to gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses followed by construction of protein-protein interaction networks using the STRING database to identify key genes. The genes were further validated via survival and differential gene expression analyses. We identified 97 upregulated and 106 downregulated genes that were primarily associated with processes such as mitosis, protein kinase activity, cell cycle, and the p53 signaling pathway. Visualization of the protein-protein interaction network identified 10 key genes (<i>CCNA2</i>, <i>CDK1</i>, <i>CDC20</i>, <i>CCNB1</i>, <i>DLGAP5</i>, <i>AURKA</i>, <i>BUB1B</i>, <i>RRM2</i>, <i>TPX2</i>, and <i>MAD2L1</i>), all of which were upregulated. Survival analysis using PROGgeneV2 showed that <i>CDC20</i>, <i>CCNA2</i>, <i>DLGAP5</i>, <i>RRM2</i>, and <i>TPX2</i> are prognosis-related key genes in HER2+ breast cancer. A nomogram showed that high expression of <i>RRM2</i>, <i>DLGAP5</i>, and <i>TPX2</i> was positively associated with the risk of death. <i>TPX2</i>, which has not previously been reported in HER2+ breast cancer, was associated with breast cancer development, progression, and prognosis and is therefore a potential key gene. It is hoped that this study can provide a new method for the diagnosis and treatment of HER2 + breast cancer. Journal: Technology in cancer research & treatment. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Primary therapy of advanced ovarian cancer is standardized, the therapy in relapsed ovarian cancer however is still controversial. In a prospective study the benefit of secondary surgery and/or second-line chemotherapy were evaluated. 139 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer were stratified according to a treatment plan: patients with early relapse (recurrence-free interval 12 months) or primary progression during chemotherapy (n=43) were treated chemotherapeutically with etoposide (p.o. vs. i.v.). Patients with late relapse (recurrence-free interval >12 months, n=96) were referred, if possible, to a secondary debulking operation, followed by a platinum-based chemotherapy. Remission-rate, toxicity and survival time were analyzed. Median survival time in the <early relapse> group was 15 months compared to 30 months in patients with late relapse (p=0.0004). Within the <late relapse> group patients with secondary debulking and chemotherapy (n=59) had a statistically significant survival advantage compared to patients who had only chemotherapy (n=37) (38 vs. 12 months, p<0.0001). The unfavorable group of patients with early relapse should be treated chemotherapeutically, whereas in patients with late relapse a secondary debulking seems to improve prognosis.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Taking a Full Snapshot of Cancer Biology: Deciphering the Tumor Microenvironment for Effective Cancer Therapy in the Oncology Clinic.. Abstract: A bottleneck that is hindering therapeutics innovation in cancers is the current lack of integration of what we have learned in tumor biology as well as the tumor microenvironment (TME). This is because tumors are complex tissues composed of cancer cells, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Although genetic alterations might cause the initial uncontrolled growth, resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells and stromal cells play additional key roles within the TME and thus influence tumor initiation, progression, therapy resistance, and metastasis. Therapies targeting cancer cells are usually insufficient when the stromal component of the TME causes therapy resistance. For innovation in cancer treatment and to take a full snapshot of cancer biology, anticancer drug design must, therefore, target both cancer cells and the stromal component. This expert review critically examines the TME components such as cancer-associated fibroblasts and ECM that can be reprogrammed to create a tumor-suppressive environment, thereby aiding in tumor treatment. Better cancer experimental models that mimic the TME such as tumor spheroids, microfluidics, three dimensional (3D) bioprinted models, and organoids will allow deeper investigations of the TME complexity and can lead to the translation of basic tumor biology to effective cancer treatments. Ultimately, innovative cancer treatments and, by extension, improvement in cancer patients' outcomes will emerge from combinatorial drug development strategies targeting both cancer cells and stromal components of the TME. Combinatorial treatment strategies can take the form of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (targeting tumor cells and stromal components) and immunotherapy that is able to regulate immune responses against tumor cells. This expert review thus addresses a previously neglected knowledge gap in cancer drug design and development by broadening the focus in cancer biology to TME so as to empower disruptive health care innovations in the oncology clinic.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The MAP kinase-interacting kinases (MNKs) as targets in oncology.. Abstract: The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinases (MNKs) are switched on by the oncogenic MAPK (ERK) signalling pathway. They phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E, a protein which recruits ribosomes to mRNAs and thereby mediates their translation. Importantly, overexpression of eIF4E can transform cells, and its function is controlled by a second oncogenic pathway, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1. Areas covered: We have evaluated the literature related to the role of the MNKs in human cancers, including their control by oncogenic signalling pathways; their expression and regulation in cancer cells and preclinical cancer models; and their roles in the proliferation, survival and migration/invasion of cancer cells. We also discuss progress towards generating specific and potent inhibitors of the MNKs and data obtained using such compounds. Expert opinion: The available data indicate that MNKs and/or eIF4E phosphorylation play a role in oncogenic transformation, the progression of at least some tumours and especially in processes related to tumour metastasis. MNKs are clearly druggable targets and, as they are not essential, significant 'side effects' of inhibiting the MNKs are likely to be limited. Further work is required to assess the efficacy of MNK inhibition in tackling tumour development, progression and metastasis. Journal: Expert opinion on therapeutic targets. Year: 2019.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Non-POU Domain-Containing Octomer-Binding (NONO) protein expression and stability promotes the tumorigenicity and activation of Akt/MAPK/\u03b2-catenin pathways in human breast cancer cells.. Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers with a high mortality rate, underscoring the need to identify new therapeutic targets. Here we report that non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding (NONO) protein is overexpressed in breast cancer and validated the interaction of the WW domain of PIN1 with c-terminal threonine-proline (thr-pro) motifs of NONO. The interaction of NONO with PIN1 increases the stability of NONO by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation, and this identifies PIN1 as a positive regulator of NONO in promoting breast tumor development. Functionally, silencing of NONO inhibits the growth, survival, migration, invasion, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stemness of breast cancer cells in vitro. A human metastatic breast cancer cell xenograft was established in transparent zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to study the metastatic inability of NONO-silenced breast cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistically, NONO depletion promotes the expression of the PDL1 cell-surface protein in breast cancer cells. The identification of novel interactions of NONO with c-Jun and \u03b2-catenin proteins and activation of the Akt/MAPK/\u03b2-catenin signaling suggests that NONO is a novel regulator of Akt/MAPK/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways. Taken together, our results indicated an essential role of NONO in the tumorigenicity of breast cancer and could be a potential target for anti-cancerous drugs. Video Abstract.

Abstract: Expression of the multidrug resistance proteins P-glycoprotein, encoded by the MDR1 gene, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) and the lung resistance-related protein or major vault protein (LRP/MVP) is associated with clinical resistance to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, the breast cancer-resistant protein (BCRP), the equivalent of mitoxantrone-resistant protein (MXR) or placental ABC transporter (ABCP), was described in AML. We investigated MDR1, MRP1, LRP/MVP and BCRP mRNA expression simultaneously in 20 paired clinical AML samples from diagnosis and relapse or refractory disease, using quantitative Taqman analysis. In addition, standard assays for P-glycoprotein expression and function were performed. BCRP was the only resistance protein that was expressed at a significantly higher RNA level (median 1.7-fold, P = 0.04) at relapsed/refractory state as compared to diagnosis. In contrast, LRP/MVP mRNA expression decreased as disease evolved (P = 0.02), whereas MDR1 and MRP1 mRNA levels were not different at relapse as compared to diagnosis. Also, at the protein level no difference of MDR1 between diagnosis and relapse was found. A significant co-expression of BCRP and MDR1 was found at diagnosis (r = 0.47, P = 0.04). The present results suggest that BCRP, but not MDR1, MRP1 or LRP/MVP is associated with clinical resistant disease in AML. Journal: Leukemia. Year: 2002.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting tumor microenvironment with RGD-functionalized nanoparticles for precision cancer therapy.. Abstract: The need for precision therapies arises from the complexities associated with high-risk types of cancer, due to their aggressiveness and resistance to treatment. These diseases represent a global issue that requires transversal strategies involving cooperation among oncology specialists and experts from related fields, including nanomedicine. Nanoparticle-mediated active targeting of tumors has proven to be a revolutionary approach to address the most challenging neoplasms by overcoming the poor permeation at tumor site of untargeted, and nowadays questioned, strategies that rely solely on Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effects. The decoration of nanoparticles with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides, which selectively target integrins on the cell membrane, marks a turning point in tumor microenvironment (TME) targeted strategies, enabling precision and efficiency in the delivery of chemotherapeutics. This review delves into the intricacies of the TME's features and targetable components (i.e. integrins), and the development of RGDs for nanoparticles' functionalization for active TME targeting. It provides a translational perspective on the integration of RGD-functionalized nanoparticles in oncology, highlighting their potential to overcome current therapeutic challenges, particularly in precision medicine. The current landscape of targeted nanomedicines in the clinic, and the development of RGD-nanomedicine for pediatric cancers are also discussed. Journal: Cancer letters. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Gastric cancer is a fatal gastrointestinal cancer with high morbidity and poor prognosis. The dismal 5-year survival rate warrants reliable biomarkers to assess and improve the prognosis of gastric cancer. Distinguishing driver mutations that are required for the cancer phenotype from passenger mutations poses a formidable challenge for cancer genomics. We integrated the multi-omics data of 293 primary gastric cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify key driver genes by establishing a prognostic model of the patients. Analyzing both copy number alteration and somatic mutation data helped us to comprehensively reveal molecular markers of genomic variation. Integrating the transcription level of genes provided a unique perspective for us to discover dysregulated factors in transcriptional regulation. We comprehensively identified 31 molecular markers of genomic variation. For instance, the copy number alteration of WASHC5 (also known as KIAA0196) frequently occurred in gastric cancer patients, which cannot be discovered using traditional methods based on significant mutations. Furthermore, we revealed that several dysregulation factors played a hub regulatory role in the process of biological metabolism based on dysregulation networks. Cancer hallmark and functional enrichment analysis showed that these key driver (KD) genes played a vital role in regulating programmed cell death. The drug response patterns and transcriptional signatures of KD genes reflected their clinical application value. These findings indicated that KD genes could serve as novel prognostic biomarkers for further research on the pathogenesis of gastric cancers. Our study elucidated a multidimensional and comprehensive genomic landscape and highlighted the molecular complexity of GC. Journal: BMC cancer. Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Epigenetic mechanism of therapeutic resistance and potential of epigenetic therapeutics in chemorefractory prostate cancer.. Abstract: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. Depending upon the histopathological subtypes of prostate cancers, various therapeutic options, such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI), immunotherapy, and chemotherapy, are available to treat prostate cancer. While these therapeutics are effective in the initial stages during treatments, the tumors subsequently develop resistance to these therapies. Despite all the progress made so far, therapeutic resistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of prostate cancer. Although various mechanisms have been reported for the resistance development in prostate cancer, altered expression of genes either directly or indirectly involved in drug response pathways is a common event. In addition to the genetic basis of gene regulation such as mutations and gene amplifications, epigenetic alterations involved in the aberrant expression of genes have frequently been shown to be associated not only with cancer initiation and progression but also with therapeutic resistance development. There are several review articles compiling reports on genetic mechanisms involved in therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer. However, epigenetic mechanisms for the therapeutic resistance development in prostate cancer have not yet been summarized in a review article. Therefore, the objective of this article is to compile various reports and provide a comprehensive review of the epigenetic aberrations, and aberrant expression of genes by epigenetic mechanisms involved in CRPCs and therapeutic resistance development in prostate cancer. Additionally, the potential of epigenetic-based therapeutics in the treatment of chemorefractory prostate cancer as evidenced by clinical trials has also been discussed.

Abstract: Lung cancer tops the list of the deadliest malignancies, consistently resisting conventional therapies and fueling the urgent pursuit of novel treatment strategies. Messenger RNA (mRNA) nanomedicines are rapidly expanding from pandemic vaccinology to oncology, but achieving efficient and targeted delivery to the lung continues to be a significant obstacle. This Mini-Review highlights advances that enable lung-focused mRNA therapeutics. We show extracellular and intracellular barriers, including mucus, surfactant, alveolar macrophages, and endosomal sequestration. We outline how ionizable lipids, polymer-lipid hybrids, extracellular-vesicle mimetics, and selective organ-targeting chemistry overcome these barriers. We overview the therapeutic payload spectrum, from multiepitope vaccines and antibody factories to tumor-suppressor restoration and <i>in vivo</i> gene editing, highlighting first-in-human data in lung cancer. We discuss persistent bottlenecks: off-target editing, cytokine toxicity, and manufacturing speed and propose design rules to accelerate translation. By integrating sequence-level mRNA design with precision nanocarriers, mRNA technology can benefit lung cancer therapy. Journal: Nano letters. Year: 2025. Authors: Yaremenko AV, Pechnikova NA, Liu C.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeted DNA and RNA Sequencing of Paired Urothelial and Squamous Bladder Cancers Reveals Discordant Genomic and Transcriptomic Events and Unique Therapeutic Implications.. Abstract: Integrated molecular profiling has identified intrinsic expression-based bladder cancer molecular subtypes. Despite frequent histological diversity, robustness of subtypes in paired conventional (urothelial) and squamous components of the same bladder tumor has not been reported. To assess the impact of histological heterogeneity on expression-based bladder cancer subtypes. We performed clinically applicable, targeted DNA and/or RNA sequencing (multiplexed DNA and RNA sequencing [mxDNAseq and mxRNAseq, respectively]) on 112 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) bladder cancer samples, including 12 cases with paired urothelial/squamous components and 21 bladder cancer cell lines. Unsupervised hierarchical and consensus clustering of target gene expression enabled derivation of basal/luminal molecular subtyping. Across 21 bladder cancer cell lines, our custom mxRNAseq panel was highly concordant with whole transcriptome sequencing, and assessed targets robustly determined expression-based basal/luminal subtypes from The Cancer Genome Atlas data (in silico) and internally sequenced FFPE tissues. Frequent deleterious TP53 (56%) and activating hotspot PIK3CA (30%) somatic mutations were seen across 69 high-quality tissue samples. Potentially targetable focal ERBB2 (6%) or EGFR (6%) amplifications were also identified, and a novel subgene copy-number detection approach is described. Combined DNA/RNA analysis showed that focally amplified samples exhibit outlier EGFR and ERBB2 expression distinct from subtype-intrinsic profiles. Critically, paired urothelial and squamous components showed divergent basal/luminal status in three of 12 cases (25%), despite identical putatively clonal prioritized somatic genomic alterations. Limitations include lack of profiled paired normal tissues for formal somatic alteration determination, and the need for formal analytical and clinical validation. Our results support the feasibility of clinically relevant integrative bladder cancer profiling and challenge the intrinsic nature of expression subtypes in histologically diverse bladder cancers. A targeted RNA sequencing assay is capable of assessing gene expression-based subtypes in individual components of clinical bladder cancer tissue specimens. Different histological components of the same tumor may yield divergent expression profiles, suggesting that expression-based subtypes should be interpreted with caution in heterogeneous cancers.

Abstract: to assess the feasibility of minimally invasive surgery in the management of lymph-nodal recurrences of gynecological cancers, in terms of surgical and oncological outcomes. we retrospectively collected patients with isolated lymph-nodal recurrent disease of gynecological malignancies who underwent to minimally invasive lymphadenectomy at Catholic University of the Sacred Hearth in Rome (Italy), from January 2013 to November 2017. Forty patients were considered eligible (31 LPS, 9 Robot); 24 (60.0%) with an ovarian cancer, 8 (20.0%) with a cervical cancer and 8 (20.0%) with an endometrial cancer recurrence. The most frequent site of lymph-nodal recurrence was represented by the aortic region (47.5%), while 18 patients (45.0%) experiencing pelvic lymph-nodal recurrence, 2 (5.0%) both pelvic and aortic relapse, and only 1 (2.5%) had an hepato-celiac lymph node recurrence. No patient required a laparotomic conversion. Median operative time was 220\u00a0min, median EBL was 80\u00a0mL, and median post-operative hospital stay was 2 days. There were 2 (5.0%) intra-operative and 4 (10.0%) post-operative complications, of which 2 were grade 3. The median follow-up was 22.5 months, and during this time 15 patients showed another relapse with a median time to progression of 12 months. Seven women died because of the disease. The 2-year post-relapse disease-free survival (PR-DFS) was 54.7%, and the 2-year post-relapse overall survival (PR-OS) was 79.3%. In our experience minimally invasive surgery is a valid therapeutic approach in very select patients with localized lymph-nodal recurrence of gynecological cancers, with benefits about peri and post-operative morbidities and without compromising their oncological outcome.

Abstract: Rapid and successful drug development has resulted in multiple treatment options for gastrointestinal cancer, requiring careful decision making for individual patients. The general theme in modern immunology is that the field is moving beyond establishing the fundamental principles of immune response mechanisms to applying these propositions to understand human diseases and develop new therapies. Immunotherapy has contributed enormously to cancer treatments with a virtual explosion in novel therapeutics including checkpoint inhibitors and other recently developed immunomodulators and the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Although the majority of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are generally considered poorly immunogenic, clinical trials have revealed that some of the patients with various gastrointestinal cancers are highly responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition-based therapies. We paid special attention to the clinical relevance of immunology and emphasized how newly developed therapies work, including what their strengths and pitfalls are. This review aims to enhance the interest of practitioners in the many specialties and subspecialties that the discipline influences and to assist them in understanding this increasing complexity.

Abstract: <b>Purpose:</b> Bone is the most predominant site of distant metastasis in prostate cancer, and patients have limited therapeutic options at this stage.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed a system-wide quantitative proteomic analysis of bone metastatic prostate tumors from 22 patients operated to relieve spinal cord compression. At the time of surgery, most patients had relapsed after androgen-deprivation therapy, while 5 were previously untreated. An extended cohort of prostate cancer bone metastases (<i>n</i> = 65) was used for immunohistochemical validation.<b>Results:</b> On average, 5,067 proteins were identified and quantified per tumor. Compared with primary tumors (<i>n</i> = 26), bone metastases were more heterogeneous and showed increased levels of proteins involved in cell-cycle progression, DNA damage response, RNA processing, and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation; and reduced levels of proteins were related to cell adhesion and carbohydrate metabolism. Within bone metastases, we identified two phenotypic subgroups: BM1, expressing higher levels of AR canonical targets, and mitochondrial and Golgi apparatus resident proteins; and BM2, with increased expression of proliferation and DNA repair-related proteins. The two subgroups, validated by the inverse correlation between MCM3 and prostate specific antigen immunoreactivity, were related to disease prognosis, suggesting that this molecular heterogeneity should be considered when developing personalized therapies.<b>Conclusions:</b> This work is the first system-wide quantitative characterization of the proteome of prostate cancer bone metastases and a valuable resource for understanding the etiology of prostate cancer progression. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(21); 5433-44. \u00a92018 AACR</i>.

Abstract: Despite significant improvements in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the prognosis for relapsing patients remains poor. The aim of this study was to generate a transcriptional profile of relapsed ALL to increase our understanding of the mechanisms involved in therapy failure. RNA was extracted from 11 pairs of cryopreserved pre-B ALL bone marrow specimens taken from the same patients at diagnosis and relapse, and analysed using HG-U133A microarrays. Relapse specimens overexpressed genes that are involved with cell growth and proliferation, in keeping with their aggressive phenotype. When tested in 72 independent specimens of pre-B ALL and T-ALL, the identified genes could successfully differentiate between diagnosis and relapse in either lineage, indicating the existence of relapse mechanisms common to both. These genes have functions relevant for oncogenesis, drug resistance and metastasis, but are not related to classical multidrug-resistance pathways. Increased expression of the top-ranked gene (BSG) at diagnosis was significantly associated with adverse outcome. Several chromosomal loci, including 19p13, were identified as potential hotspots for aberrant gene expression in relapsed ALL. Our results provide evidence for a link between drug resistance and the microenvironment that has previously only been considered in the context of solid tumour biology.

Abstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a vital role in cancer survival and progression and may play roles in drug resistance and immune escape. To date, few studies have detailed the TME of Ewing sarcoma. We performed spatially resolved transcriptomics of primary treatment-na\u00efve Ewing sarcoma tumor biopsies from patients with or without clinical metastasis, complemented by high-plex spatial proteomic analysis. We discovered greater stromal enrichment in localized Ewing sarcoma primary tumors compared with metastasis-associated Ewing sarcoma primary tumors. Through spatial ligand-receptor analysis, we showed that the stroma-enriched regions harbor unique extracellular matrix-related cytokines, immune recruitment, and proinflammatory microenvironmental signals, implying that Ewing sarcoma stroma may play an antitumor role by acting as an immune recruitment center. All Ewing sarcoma tumors expressed protumorigenic macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-CD74 immune signaling connectivity, suggesting a potential immune-evasive mechanism. In addition to the immune recruitment role of tumor-associated stroma, our findings provide spatial insights into the TME of Ewing sarcoma and provide a rationale for the preclinical investigation of MIF as a potential target for Ewing sarcoma immunotherapy.

Abstract: In 1982, the RAS genes HRAS and KRAS were discovered as the first human cancer genes, with KRAS later identified as one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes. Yet, it took nearly 40 years to develop clinically effective inhibitors for RAS-mutant cancers. The discovery in 2013 by Shokat and colleagues of a druggable pocket in KRAS paved the way to FDA approval of the first covalently binding KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors, sotorasib and adagrasib, in 2021 and 2022, respectively. However, rather than marking the end of a successful assault on the Mount Everest of cancer research, this landmark only revealed new challenges in RAS drug discovery. In this review, we highlight the progress on defining resistance mechanisms and developing combination treatment strategies to improve patient responses to KRAS therapies. Journal: Trends in cancer.

Abstract: Serine metabolism plays a pivotal role in cancer progression by supporting essential biosynthetic pathways and energy production. Exploring the intricacies of serine metabolism in cancer may uncover novel therapeutic opportunities. This study presents a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of serine metabolism-related genes (SMGs), with a particular emphasis on colorectal cancer (CRC), to elucidate their expression patterns, genetic alterations and clinical significance. We performed a pan-cancer analysis of SMGs using integrating transcriptomic, genomic and epigenetic data from TCGA and GTEx databases. For CRC, we performed in-depth analyses comparing expression patterns between tumour and normal tissues, examining prognostic significance and exploring associations with the tumour microenvironment (TME). The distribution patterns of SMGs within the TME were further investigated using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Key SMGs, including PHGDH, SLC1A5 and SLC38A2, were validated in two independent real-world cohorts of CRC. Pan-cancer analysis revealed that SMGs are differentially expressed across tumour types, with their dysregulation associated with copy number alterations and epigenetic modifications. In CRC, aberrant SMG expression is significantly associated with clinical outcomes, key signalling pathways and the TME. Notably, PHGDH was consistently upregulated in CRC and associated with poor prognosis, while SLC1A5 emerged as a potential biomarker for liver metastasis. This study underscores the importance of SMGs, particularly PHGDH, SLC1A5 and SLC38A2, in CRC progression and prognosis. Our findings offer valuable insights into SMGs as a potential therapeutic target and provide a foundation for developing personalised metabolic interventions in CRC.

Abstract: Previously, we have shown that the aggregation of RNA-level gene expression profiles into quantitative molecular pathway activation metrics results in lesser batch effects and better agreement between different experimental platforms. Here, we investigate whether pathway level of data analysis provides any advantage when comparing transcriptomic and proteomic data. We compare the paired proteomic and transcriptomic gene expression and pathway activation profiles obtained for the same human cancer biosamples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the NCI Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) projects, for a total of 755 samples of glioblastoma, breast, liver, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and uterine cancers. In a CPTAC assay, expression levels of 15,112 protein-coding genes were profiled using the Thermo QE series of mass spectrometers. In TCGA, RNA expression levels of the same genes were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 engine for the same biosamples. At the gene level, absolute gene expression values are compared, whereas pathway-grade comparisons are made between the pathway activation levels (PALs) calculated using average sample-normalized transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. We observed remarkably different average correlations between the primary RNA- and protein expression data for different cancer types: Spearman Rho between 0.017 (p = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221213) and 0.27 (p < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216). However, at the pathway level we detected overall statistically significantly higher correlations: averaged Rho between 0.022 (p < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216) and 0.56 (p < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216). Thus, we conclude that data analysis at the PAL-level yields results of a greater similarity when comparing high-throughput RNA and protein expression profiles.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the common malignant tumors of the urological system, and metastasis often occurs in advanced stages. Chemotherapy is an effective treatment for advanced PCa but has limitations in terms of efficacy, side effects, multidrug resistance, and high treatment costs. Therefore, new treatment modalities for PCa need to be explored and improved. R language and GEO database were used to obtain differentially expressed genes for PCa single-cell sequencing. TCMSP, STITCH, SwissTargetPrediction, and PubChem databases were used to obtain the active ingredients and targets of <i>Pueraria lobata</i> (PL). Next, Cytoscape software was used to draw the interactive network diagram of \"drug-active component-target pathway.\" Based on the STRING database, the protein-protein interaction network was constructed. Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were applied for the genes. Molecular docking was used to visualize the drug-target interaction via AutoDock Vina and PyMOL. Finally, prognosis-related genes were found by survival analysis, and Protein Atlas was used for validation. Four active components and 31 target genes were obtained through the regulatory network of PL. Functional enrichment analysis showed that PL played a pharmacological role in the treatment of PCa by regulating the metabolic processes of reactive oxygen species, response to steroid hormones, and oxidative stress as well as IL-17 signaling pathway, PCa, and estrogen signaling pathway. Single-cell data showed that <i>AR</i>, <i>MIF</i>, <i>HSP90B1</i>, and <i>MAOA</i> genes were highly expressed, and molecular docking analysis showed that representative components had a strong affinity with receptor proteins. Survival analysis found that <i>APOE</i>, <i>CA2</i>, <i>IGFBP3</i>, <i>MIF</i>, <i>F10</i>, and <i>NR3C1</i> could predict progression-free survival (PFS), and some of them could be validated in PCa. In this paper, a drug-active ingredient-target pathway network of PL at the single-cell level of PCa was constructed, and the findings revealed that it acted on genes such as <i>AR</i>, <i>MIF</i>, <i>HSP90B1</i>, and <i>MAOA</i> to regulate several biological processes and related signaling pathways to interfere with the occurrence and development of PCa. <i>APOE</i>, <i>CA2</i>, <i>IGFBP3</i>, <i>MIF</i>, <i>F10</i>, and <i>NR3C1</i> were also important as target genes in predicting PFS.

Abstract: Once an obscure disease, recent studies have transformed our understanding of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). In this review, we summarize new major advances in the genetics and biology of AITL. Genome wide sequencing studies have dissected the repertoire of the genetic alterations driving AITL uncovering a highly recurrent Gly17Val somatic mutation in the small GTPase RHOA and major role for mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as TET2, DNMT3A and IDH2, and signaling factors (e.g., FYN and CD28). These findings support a multistep model of follicular T helper cell transformation in AITL and pinpoint novel candidates for the development of targeted therapies in this disease. AITL originates from follicular T helper cells and is characterized by the presence of RHOA G17V mutation together with genetic alterations in TET2, DNMT3A, and IDH2. Research efforts now focus on the elucidation of the specific roles and interplay of these genetic alterations in the pathogenesis of AITL. Journal: Current opinion in hematology. Year: 2016.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: From inflammation to metastasis: The central role of miR-155 in modulating NF-\u03baB in cancer.. Abstract: Cancer is a multifaceted, complex disease characterized by unchecked cell growth, genetic mutations, and dysregulated signalling pathways. These factors eventually cause evasion of apoptosis, sustained angiogenesis, tissue invasion, and metastasis, which makes it difficult for targeted therapeutic interventions to be effective. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential gene expression regulators linked to several biological processes, including cancer and inflammation. The NF-\u03baB signalling pathway, a critical regulator of inflammatory reactions and oncogenesis, has identified miR-155 as a significant participant in its modulation. An intricate network of transcription factors known as the NF-\u03baB pathway regulates the expression of genes related to inflammation, cell survival, and immunological responses. The NF-\u03baB pathway's dysregulation contributes to many cancer types' development, progression, and therapeutic resistance. In numerous cancer models, the well-studied miRNA miR-155 has been identified as a crucial regulator of NF-\u03baB signalling. The p65 subunit and regulatory molecules like I\u03baB are among the primary targets that miR-155 directly targets to alter NF-\u03baB activity. The molecular processes by which miR-155 affects the NF-\u03baB pathway are discussed in this paper. It also emphasizes the miR-155's direct and indirect interactions with important NF-\u03baB cascade elements to control the expression of NF-\u03baB subunits. We also investigate how miR-155 affects NF-\u03baB downstream effectors in cancer, including inflammatory cytokines and anti-apoptotic proteins. Journal: Pathology, research and practice. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Parthanatos and its associated components: Promising therapeutic targets for cancer.. Abstract: Parthanatos is a PARP1-dependent, caspase-independent, cell-death pathway that is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, or other known forms of cell death. Parthanatos is a multistep pathway that plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. There are many molecules in the parthanatos cascade that can be exploited to create therapeutic interventions for cancer management, including PARP1, PARG, ARH3, AIF, and MIF. These critical molecules are involved in tumor cell proliferation, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Therefore, these molecular signals in the parthanatos cascade represent promising therapeutic targets for cancer therapy. In addition, intimate interactions occur between parthanatos and other forms of cancer cell death, such as apoptosis and autophagy. Thus, co-targeting a combination of parthanatos and other death pathways may further provide a new avenue for cancer precision treatment. In this review, we elaborate on the signaling pathways of canonical parthanatos and briefly introduce the non-canonical parthanatos. We also shed light on the role parthanatos and its associated components play in tumorigenesis, particularly with respect to the aforementioned five molecules, and discuss the promise targeted therapy of parthanatos and its associated components holds for cancer therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Proteome-wide mendelian randomization study implicates therapeutic targets in common cancers.. Abstract: The interest in targeted cancer therapies has been growing rapidly. While numerous cancer biomarkers and targeted treatment strategies have been developed and employed, there are still significant limitations and challenges in the early diagnosis and targeted treatment of cancers. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to identify novel targets and develop new targeted drugs. The study was conducted using combined cis-Mendelian randomization (cis-MR) and colocalization analysis. We analyzed data from 732 plasma proteins to identify potential drug targets associated with eight site-specific cancers. These findings were further validated using the UK Biobank dataset. Then, a protein-protein interaction network was also constructed to examine the interplay between the identified proteins and the targets of existing cancer medications. This MR analysis revealed associations between five plasma proteins and prostate cancer, five with breast cancer, and three with lung cancer. Subsequently, these proteins were classified into four distinct target groups, with a focus on tier 1 and 2 targets due to their higher potential to become drug targets. Our study indicatied that genetically predicted KDELC2 (OR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.86-0.93) and TNFRSF10B (OR: 0.74, 95% CI 0.65-0.83) are inversely associated with prostate cancer. Furthermore, we observed an inverse association between CPNE1 (OR: 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.98) and breast cancer, while PDIA3 (OR: 1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.30) were found to be associated with the risk of breast cancer. In addition, we also propose that SPINT2 (OR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.06), GSTP1 (OR: 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.90), and CTSS (OR: 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.95) may serve as potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer. Similarly, GDI2 (OR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.91), ISLR2 (OR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.93), and CTSF (OR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.21) could potentially be targets for breast cancer. Additionally, we identified SFTPB (OR: 0.93, 95% CI 0.91-0.95), ICAM5 (OR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.97), and FLRT3 (OR: 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15) as potential targets for lung cancer. Notably, TNFRSF10B, GSTP1, and PDIA3 were found to interact with the target proteins of current medications used in prostate or breast cancer treatment. This comprehensive analysis has highlighted thirteen plasma proteins with potential roles in three site-specific cancers. Continued research in this area may reveal their therapeutic potential, particularly KDELC2, TNFRSF10B, CPNE1, and PDIA3, paving the way for more effective cancer treatments.

Abstract: Cross-resistance to molecules used in endocrine therapy is among the main challenges in the treatment of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) positive breast cancer. In this study, we used two different cell models of resistance to anti-estrogens: MVLN/CL6.7 cells and VP229/VP267 cells selected after exposure to tamoxifen respectively in vitro and in vivo to characterize a phenotype rarely observed, i.e. acquisition of cross-resistance to the pure ER antagonist fulvestrant. As MVLN/CL6.7 cells and VP229/VP267 cell lines are original and valuable models of cross-resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant, we examined candidate genes using a RTQ-PCR strategy to identify new biomarkers of endocrine resistance. Out of the 26 candidate genes tested, 19 displayed deregulation of expression at the basal level in at least one of the two resistant cell lines. Eight genes (TACC1, NOV, PTTG1, MAD2L1, BAK1, TGFB2, BIRC5, and CCNE2) were significantly overexpressed in samples from ER-positive breast cancer patients who relapsed after tamoxifen treatment (n=24) compared with samples from patients who did not (n=24). Five genes (TACC1, NOV, PTTG1, BAK1, and TGFB2) were correlated with significantly shorter relapse-free survival (univariate analysis). Finally, we identified TACC1 and a three-gene expression signature (TACC1, NOV, and PTTG1) as independent prognostic markers (multivariate analysis). Aberrant mRNA and protein levels of TACC1, NOV, and PTTG1 were also observed under tamoxifen and/or fulvestrant exposure in resistant CL6.7 cells compared with their respective control MVLN cells. In conclusion, our data identify TACC1, NOV, and PTTG1 as promising new markers that could be used in the clinical management of ER-positive breast cancer patients.

Abstract: Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation and the dysregulation of numerous biological functions, including metabolism. Because of the potential implications of targeted therapies, the metabolic alterations seen in cancer cells, such as the Warburg effect and disruptions in lipid and amino acid metabolism, have gained attention in cancer research. In this review, we delve into recent research examining the influence of natural products on altered cancer metabolism. Natural products were selected based on their ability to target cancer's altered metabolism. We identified the targets and explored the mechanisms of action of these natural products in influencing cellular energetics. Studies discussed in this review provide a solid ground for researchers to consider natural products in cancer treatment alone and in combination with conventional anticancer therapies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Functional significance of Hippo/YAP signaling for drug resistance in colorectal cancer.. Abstract: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. While early stage colorectal cancer can be removed by surgery, patients with advanced disease are treated by chemotherapy, with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) as a main ingredient. However, most patients with advanced colorectal cancer eventually succumb to the disease despite some responded initially. Thus, identifying molecular mechanisms responsible for drug resistance will help design novel strategies to treat colorectal cancer. In this study, we analyzed an acquired 5-FU resistant cell line, LoVo-R, and determined that elevated expression of YAP target genes is a major alteration in the 5-FU resistant cells. Hippo/YAP signaling, a pathway essential for cell polarity, is an important regulator for tissue homeostasis, organ size, and stem cells. We demonstrated that knockdown of YAP1 sensitized LoVo-R cells to 5-FU treatment in cultured cells and in mice. The relevance of our studies to colorectal cancer patients is reflected by our discovery that high expression of YAP target genes in the tumor was associated with an increased risk of cancer relapse and poor survival in a larger cohort of colorectal cancer patients who underwent 5-FU-related chemotherapy. Taken together, we demonstrate a critical role of YAP signaling for drug resistance in colorectal cancer. Journal: Molecular carcinogenesis. Year: 2018. Authors: Song R, Gu D, Zhang L, Zhang X, Yu B.

Abstract: Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) is a major pathway of mammalian DNA repair that is associated with drug resistance and has not been well characterized in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The objective of this study was to explore the role of NER in relapsed ALL patients. We hypothesized that increased expression of NER genes was associated with drug resistance and relapse in ALL. We performed secondary data analysis on two sets of pediatric ALL patients that all ultimately relapsed, and who had matched diagnosis-relapse gene expression microarray data (GSE28460 and GSE18497). GSE28460 included 49 precursor-B-ALL patients, and GSE18497 included 27 precursor-B-ALL and 14\u00a0T-ALL patients. Microarray data were processed using the\u00a0Plier 16 algorithm and the 20 canonical NER genes were extracted. Comparisons were made between time of diagnosis and relapse, and between early and late relapsing subgroups. The Chi-square test was used to evaluate whether NER gene expression was altered at the level of the entire pathway and individual gene expression was compared using t-tests. We found that gene expression of the NER pathway was significantly increased upon relapse in patients that took 3\u00a0years or greater to relapse (late relapsers, P\u2009=\u2009.007), whereas no such change was evident in patients that relapsed in less than 3\u00a0years (early relapsers, P\u2009=\u00a0.180). Moreover, at diagnosis, the NER gene expression of the early relapsing subpopulation was already\u00a0significantly elevated over that of the late relapsing group (P\u2009<\u2009.001). This pattern was validated by an 'NER score' established by averaging the relative expression of the 20 canonical NER genes. The NER score at diagnosis was found to be significantly associated with disease-free survival in precursor-B-ALL (P\u00a0<\u2009.001). Patients are over two times more likely to undergo early relapse if they have a high NER score at diagnosis, hazard ratio 2.008, 95% CI (1.256-3.211). The NER score may provide a\u00a0underlying mechanism for \"time to remission\", a known prognostic factor in ALL, and a rationale for differential treatment. Journal: BMC medical genomics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Personalised cancer medicine.. Abstract: The evolving field of personalised medicine is playing an increasingly important role in cancer prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutics. Its importance in clinical management is demonstrated by the recent introduction into routine clinical practice of various individualised, molecularly targeted therapies with increased efficacy and/or reduced toxicity. The identification of cancer predisposition genes, such as the BRCA genes in breast cancer, permits screening programmes to identify patients \"at-risk\" of developing cancer and helps them make decisions on individual risk-modification behaviours. Personalised medicine also plays an increasingly important role in cancer treatment. It is increasingly clear that there are molecularly distinct subtypes of various common cancers, with different therapeutic approaches required for each subtype, for example, the use of the monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and cetuximab) in HER2-positive breast cancer and wild-type KRAS colorectal cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and crizotinib) in chronic myeloid leukaemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumours and non-small-cell lung cancer and intracellular agents (vemurafenib and olaparib) in metastatic malignant melanoma and ovarian, breast and prostate cancer. The efficacy of various targeted therapies in such disparate tumours suggests that we are entering an era in which treatment decisions will be based on tumour molecular abnormality profile or \"signature,\" rather than tumour tissue type or anatomical site of origin, improving patient prognosis and quality of life. This mini review focuses on the role of personalised medicine in cancer prevention and treatment as well as its future direction in oncology. Journal: International journal of cancer. Year: 2015.

Abstract: Adipocytes, which represent a substantial part of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer, secrete several adipokines that affect tumorigenesis, cancer progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance via multiple signaling pathways. Areas covered: In this review, we focus on the role of leptin, adiponectin, autotaxin, and interleukin-6 in breast cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and drug response. Furthermore, we investigated adipokines as potential targets of breast cancer-specific drugs. Expert opinion: Adipokines and adipokine receptors are deregulated in breast cancer. Adipokines play various roles in breast cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and drug response, hence, adipokine signaling could be an effective drug target. Several clinical trials are in progress to test the efficacy of adipokine targeting agents. However, adipokines also affect metabolic homeostasis; hence, the adverse effects of the targeted drug should be investigated and addressed. Journal: Expert opinion on therapeutic targets.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Androgen Receptor and Beyond, Targeting Androgen Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.. Abstract: The development of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) signals the terminal disease phase. The preceding hormone-dependent disease setting is effectively managed with androgen deprivation therapy. This foundation of treatment has a high rate of biochemical and clinical response and meaningful clinical benefit but is finite in duration as most cancers will progress to castration resistance. Historically, treatment for mCRPC entailed androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors (nilutamide, flutamide, bicalutamide), nonspecific steroidal biosynthesis inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole), steroids (prednisone, diethylstilbesterol, dexamethasone), or palliative chemotherapy (mitoxantrone, estramustine), but none of these strategies impacted survival. Docetaxel was the first agent to demonstrate a survival improvement in this population, and other therapies followed (cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and radium-223). Understanding how prostate cancer cells grow in a systemic androgen-deprived environment further changed this clinical landscape. Deciphering what steroidogenic enzymes are overactive and required for testosterone/dihydrotestosterone synthesis has yielded therapies directed toward both adrenal and tumor-derived androgens. All androgens normally act through AR, and this fact remains true in mCRPC. The cancer accomplishes this by overexpressing the receptor (by genomic copy-number gains or RNA amplification), mutating it directly to lose its selectivity for testosterone/dihydrotestosterone, or selecting for splice variants that do not require ligand at all. These resistance mechanisms result in persistent AR-mediated signaling. Through this understanding, drugs targeting non-ligand-binding aspects of AR functioning (e.g., nuclear translocation, cofactor recruitment) have been developed. Finally, how AR interacts with other signaling pathway is being explored, and new combinations of targets to test are being proposed. Multiple compounds remain in various stages of clinical development based on targeting these resistance pathways, and hopefully, they will further the armamentarium for mCRPC. This review visits these mechanisms of resistance, how they are targeted, and remaining challenges in implementing these therapies into clinical practice among the other approved treatments.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Treatment of recurrent disease: randomized trials of monotherapy versus combination chemotherapy.. Abstract: Recurrent ovarian carcinoma is normally an incurable disease situation in which chemotherapy is the usual treatment for palliation. The probability of response to chemotherapy depends on the time from last chemotherapy and the previous response observed. The issue of combination chemotherapy versus monotherapy is a clinically relevant dilemma for medical and gynecologic oncologist involved in the treatment of recurrent patients. In those patients with platinum-resistant relapse, combination chemotherapy has been associated with higher toxicity without a clear clinical benefit in randomized clinical trials. Therefore, a less toxic sequential monotherapy approach should be the choice for resistant patients. On the other hand, two large randomized clinical trials have proved the superiority of a platinum-based doublet over platinum monotherapy in platinum-sensitive recurrent patients. The ICON-4/AGO-OVAR 2.2 trial demonstrated that the combination of paclitaxel-carboplatin (or cisplatin) is likely to provide a survival benefit compared with carboplatin monotherapy. This benefit was more clear in patients with a treatment free-interval >12 months. Moreover, the AGO-OVAR 2.5 trial, with the cooperation of NCIC CTG and EORTC GCG, has confirmed the advantage in response rate and progression free survival of the doublet carboplatin-gemcitabine compared to carboplatin.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Opportunities and challenges in combination gene cancer therapy.. Abstract: Treatment for solid tumor malignancies, which constitute the majority of human cancers, is still dominated by surgery and radiotherapies. This is especially true for many localized solid tumors, which are often curable with these treatments. However, metastatic cancers are beyond the reach of these therapies, and many localized cancers that are initially treated with surgery and radiation will recur and metastasize. Thus, for over 60years there has been a concerted effort to develop effective drug treatments for metastatic cancers. Combination therapies are an increasingly important part of the anti-cancer drug armamentarium. In the case of cytotoxic chemotherapy, multi-drug regimens rapidly became the norm, as the earliest single agents were relatively ineffective. In contrast to chemotherapy, where combination therapies were required in order to achieve treatment efficacy, for both hormonal and targeted therapies the impetus to move toward the use of combination therapies is to prevent or reverse the development of treatment resistance. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that combination therapy may also improve cancer treatment by neutralizing an emerging treatment side effect termed therapy-induced metastasis, which accompanies some effective single agent therapies. Finally, although gene therapy is still far from use in the clinic, we propose that combination therapies may enhance its effectiveness. Journal: Advanced drug delivery reviews. Year: 2016.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrative single-cell and spatial transcriptomics uncover ELK4-mediated mechanisms in <i>NDUFAB1</i>+ tumor cells driving gastric cancer progression, metabolic reprogramming, and immune evasion.. Abstract: Globally, gastric cancer (GC) stands as the fifth most prevalent form of malignant neoplasm and represents a significant contributor to mortality associated with oncological conditions. Despite advancements in therapeutic strategies for GC, the outcomes for patients with advanced stages of the disease continue to be unfavorable, largely due to tumor heterogeneity and the challenges posed by resistance to therapeutic agents. Metabolic reprogramming is pivotal in driving the advancement of GC, contributing to the development of resistance to pharmacological treatments and facilitating the cancer's ability to evade immune surveillance. Developing multi-target comprehensive treatment strategies by integrating tumor microenvironment (TME) modulation holds promise for significantly improving therapeutic efficacy. The study analyzed GC and identified key cell subtypes by integrating data derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) alongside spatial transcriptomics information. Cell type identification was accomplished using the tool of Seurat, and the spatial distribution of cell types was revealed through the Robust Cell Type Decomposition technique. CellChat was used to analyze the interactions between key cell subtypes and other cells, and the \"StLearn\" package was employed to investigate spatial cell communication in depth. Additionally, the functional role of the key molecule ELK4 was validated through <i>in vitro</i> experiments. This research utilized scRNA-seq combined with spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively analyze GC, identifying the C1 <i>NDUFAB1</i>+ subtype, which exhibited high proliferative activity, metabolic reprogramming capabilities, and immune evasion properties. It was found that the C1 <i>NDUFAB1</i>+ subtype closely interacted with fibroblasts and pericytes via the PARs signaling pathway. Additionally, <i>in vitro</i> experiments confirmed that knockdown of ELK4 substantially curbed tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This study revealed the main significance of the C1 <i>NDUFAB1</i>+ subtype in GC, elucidating its core mechanisms in tumor progression, metabolic reprogramming, and immune evasion. ELK4 was identified as a key regulatory factor that markedly enhanced the proliferation, migratory capacity, and invasive potential of tumor cells, while changes in the TME were a driving force behind immune suppression and drug resistance. The findings underscored the importance of developing specific therapeutic targets, targeting metabolic reprogramming, and overcoming immune evasion, providing new theoretical foundations.

Abstract: The standard of care in locally advanced rectal cancer is neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) followed by radical surgery. Response to nCRT varies among patients and pathological complete response is associated with better outcome. However, there is a lack of effective methods to select rectal cancer patients who would or would not have a benefit from nCRT. The utility of clinicopathological and radiological features are limited due to lack of adequate sensitivity and specificity. Molecular biomarkers have the potential to predict response to nCRT at an early time point, but none have currently reached the clinic. Integration of diverse types of biomarkers including clinicopathological and imaging features, identification of mechanistic link to tumor biology, and rigorous validation using samples which represent disease heterogeneity, will allow to develop a sensitive and cost-effective molecular biomarker panel for precision medicine in rectal cancer. Here, we aim to review the recent advance in tissue- and blood-based molecular biomarker research and illustrate their potential in predicting nCRT response in rectal cancer.

Abstract: Cancer treatment is rapidly evolving and this review provides healthcare professionals who are not specialists in cancer therapeutics with a broad overview of the role of cancer systemic therapy, with a particular focus on chemotherapy.Historically, the majority of cytotoxic chemotherapy was used in patients with incurable or metastatic disease with the goal of disease control and symptom palliation. Now, with the advent of more effective, targeted systemic therapies (incorporating both cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic agents), systemic therapies are being used in more diverse treatment settings, both to increase the likelihood of cure and to induce prolonged disease remission.Chemotherapy (henceforth referring specifically to cytotoxic chemotherapy) remains important for the treatment of many cancer types. This article will review the principles of chemotherapy and the first-line systemic treatment paradigm of different cancer types. The potential toxicities of chemotherapy will also be described.

Abstract: Endometrial cancer recurrence occurs in about 18\u00a0% of patients. This study aims to analyze the pattern recurrence of endometrial cancer and the relationship between the initial site of primary disease and the relapse site in patients undergoing surgical treatment. We retrospectively reviewed all surgically treated patients with endometrial cancer selecting those with recurrence. We defined primary site disease as uterus, lymph nodes, or peritoneum according to pathology analysis of the surgical specimen. The site of recurrence was defined as vaginal cuff, lymph nodes, peritoneum, and parenchymatous organs. Our primary endpoint was to correlate the site of initial disease with the site of recurrence. The study enrolled 1416 patients. The overall recurrence rate was 17,5 % with 248 relapses included in the study. An increase of 9.9, 5.7, and 5.7 times in the odds of relapse on the lymph node, peritoneum, and abdominal parenchymatous sites respectively was observed in case of nodal initial disease (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A not significant difference in odds was observed in terms of vaginal cuff relapse (OR 0.9) between lymph node ad uterine primary disease (p\u00a0=\u00a00.78). An increasing OR of 8.7 times for nodal recurrences, 46.6 times for peritoneum, and 23.3 times for parenchymatous abdominal recurrences were found in the case of primary peritoneal disease (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Endometrial cancer tends to recur at the initial site of the disease. Intraoperative inspection of the adjacent sites of primary disease and targeted instrumental examination of the initial sites of disease during follow-up are strongly recommended.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Screening of common genomic biomarkers to explore common drugs for the treatment of pancreatic and kidney cancers with type-2 diabetes through bioinformatics analysis.. Abstract: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a crucial risk factor for both pancreatic cancer (PC) and kidney cancer (KC). However, effective common drugs for treating PC and/or KC patients who are also suffering from T2D are currently lacking, despite the probability of their co-occurrence. Taking disease-specific multiple drugs during the co-existence of multiple diseases may lead to adverse side effects or toxicity to the patients due to drug-drug interactions. This study aimed to identify T2D-, PC and KC-causing common genomic biomarkers (cGBs) highlighting their pathogenetic mechanisms to explore effective drugs as their common treatment. We analyzed transcriptomic profile datasets, applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis approaches to identify T2D-, PC-, and KC-causing cGBs. We then disclosed common pathogenetic mechanisms through gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG pathways, regulatory networks, and DNA methylation of these cGBs. Initially, we identified 78 common differentially expressed genes (cDEGs) that could distinguish T2D, PC, and KC samples from controls based on their transcriptomic profiles. From these, six top-ranked cDEGs (TOP2A, BIRC5, RRM2, ALB, MUC1, and E2F7) were selected as cGBs and considered targets for exploring common drug molecules for each of three diseases. Functional enrichment analyses, including GO terms, KEGG pathways, and regulatory network analyses involving transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs, along with DNA methylation and immune infiltration studies, revealed critical common molecular mechanisms linked to PC, KC, and T2D. Finally, we identified six top-ranked drug molecules (NVP.BHG712, Irinotecan, Olaparib, Imatinib, RG-4733, and Linsitinib) as potential common treatments for PC, KC and T2D during their co-existence, supported by the literature reviews. Thus, this bioinformatics study provides valuable insights and resources for developing a genome-guided common treatment strategy for PC and/or KC patients who are also suffering from T2D.

Abstract: In 1975, K\u00f6hler and Milstein invented hybridoma technology for the generation of murine monoclonal antibodies with predetermined antigen-binding specificity. The transformative impact of monoclonal antibodies is demonstrated by their ubiquitous use as biomedical research reagents and the worldwide approval of at least 212 antibody therapeutics with tens of millions of patients treated to date. Advances in antibody technologies, such as humanization and robust methods for human antibody generation, mitigated the major limitations of murine antibodies as therapeutics. These technologies, combined with progress in biomanufacturing, helped to launch this modern era of antibody therapeutics. Beyond IgG, antibody therapeutics have blossomed into multiple alternative formats, including bispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates. Additionally, antibody fragments have been developed as stand-alone therapeutics and to target cell therapies, notably chimeric antigen receptor T cells. These advances in antibody technologies, plus innovation enabling subcutaneous delivery, have improved the therapeutic benefits and convenience of antibody treatment for many patients. This concept is illustrated here by multiple generations of antibody therapeutics for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)<sup>+</sup> cancers and B cell-targeted therapies for haematological cancers and immunological diseases. Finally, we opine briefly on some of the many promising future directions with antibody therapeutics, including the application of artificial intelligence for antibody identification and multi-parameter optimization.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting Transcription Factors for Cancer Treatment.. Abstract: Transcription factors are involved in a large number of human diseases such as cancers for which they account for about 20% of all oncogenes identified so far. For long time, with the exception of ligand-inducible nuclear receptors, transcription factors were considered as \u201cundruggable\u201d targets. Advances knowledge of these transcription factors, in terms of structure, function (expression, degradation, interaction with co-factors and other proteins) and the dynamics of their mode of binding to DNA has changed this postulate and paved the way for new therapies targeted against transcription factors. Here, we discuss various ways to target transcription factors in cancer models: by modulating their expression or degradation, by blocking protein/protein interactions, by targeting the transcription factor itself to prevent its DNA binding either through a binding pocket or at the DNA-interacting site, some of these inhibitors being currently used or evaluated for cancer treatment. Such different targeting of transcription factors by small molecules is facilitated by modern chemistry developing a wide variety of original molecules designed to specifically abort transcription factor and by an increased knowledge of their pathological implication through the use of new technologies in order to make it possible to improve therapeutic control of transcription factor oncogenic functions.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Transcriptomics and solid tumors: The next frontier in precision cancer medicine.. Abstract: Transcriptomics, which encompasses assessments of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, identification of fusion transcripts, explorations of noncoding RNAs, transcript annotation, and discovery of novel transcripts, is a valuable tool for understanding cancer mechanisms and identifying biomarkers. Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have enabled large-scale gene expression profiling. Importantly, RNA expression profiling of tumor tissue has been successfully used to determine clinically actionable molecular alterations. The WINTHER precision medicine clinical trial was the first prospective trial in diverse solid malignancies that assessed both genomics and transcriptomics to match treatments to specific molecular alterations. The use of transcriptome analysis in WINTHER and other trials increased the number of targetable -omic changes compared to genomic profiling alone. Other applications of transcriptomics involve the evaluation of tumor and circulating noncoding RNAs as predictive and prognostic biomarkers, the improvement of risk stratification by the use of prognostic and predictive multigene assays, the identification of fusion transcripts that drive tumors, and an improved understanding of the impact of DNA changes as some genomic alterations are silenced at the RNA level. Finally, RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis have been incorporated into clinical trials to identify markers predicting response to immunotherapy. Many issues regarding the complexity of the analysis, its reproducibility and variability, and the interpretation of the results still need to be addressed. The integration of transcriptomics with genomics, proteomics, epigenetics, and tumor immune profiling will improve biomarker discovery and our understanding of disease mechanisms and, thereby, accelerate the implementation of precision oncology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targetable Intercellular Signaling Pathways Facilitate Lung Colonization in Osteosarcoma.. Abstract: Outcomes for young people diagnosed with osteosarcoma hinge almost exclusively on whether they develop lung metastasis. The striking predilection that osteosarcoma shows for metastatic spread to lung suggests properties and/or lung interactions that generate tissue-specific survival and proliferation advantages. While these mechanisms remain overall poorly defined, studies have begun to describe biological elements important to metastasis. Mechanisms described to date include both cell-autonomous adaptations that allow disseminated tumor cells to survive the stressors imposed by metastasis and intercellular signaling networks that tumor cells exploit to pirate needed signals from surrounding tissues or to recruit other cells that create a more favorable niche. Evidence suggests that cell-autonomous changes are largely driven by epigenetic reprogramming of disseminated tumor cells that facilitates resistance to late apoptosis, manages endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors, promotes translation of complex transcripts, and activates clotting pathways. Tumor-host signaling pathways important for lung colonization drive interactions with lung epithelium, mesenchymal stem cells, and mediators of innate and adaptive immunity. In this chapter, we highlight one particular pathway that integrates cell-autonomous adaptations with lung-specific tumor-host interactions. In this mechanism, aberrant \u0394Np63 expression primes tumor cells to produce IL6 and CXCL8 upon interaction with lung epithelial cells. This tumor-derived IL6 and CXCL8 then initiates autocrine, osteosarcoma-lung paracrine, and osteosarcoma-immune paracrine interactions that facilitate metastasis. Importantly, many of these pathways appear targetable with clinically feasible therapeutics. Ongoing work to better understand metastasis is driving efforts to improve outcomes by targeting the most devastating complication of this disease.

Abstract: Sustained proliferative signaling and de-regulated cellular bioenergetics are two of the chief hallmarks of cancer. Alterations in the Ras pathway and its downstream effectors are among the major drivers for uncontrolled cell growth in many cancers. The GTPases are one of the signaling molecules that activate crucial signal transducing pathways downstream of Ras through several effector proteins. The GTPases (GTP bound) interact with several effectors and modulate a number of different biological pathways including those that regulate cytoskeleton, cellular motility, cytokinesis, proliferation, apoptosis, transcription and nuclear signaling. Similarly, the altered glycolytic pathway, the so-called 'Warburg effect', rewires tumor cell metabolism to support the biosynthetic requirements of uncontrolled proliferation. There exists strong evidence for the critical role of the glycolytic pathway's rate limiting enzymes in promoting immunosuppression. Areas covered: We review the emerging roles of GTPase effector proteins particularly the p21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4) and nicotinamide biosynthetic pathway enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) as signaling molecules in immune surveillance and the immune response. Expert opinion: In this expert opinion article we highlight the recent information on the role of GTPases and the metabolic enzymes on the immune microenvironment and propose some unique immune therapeutic opportunities.

Abstract: DNA repair vulnerabilities are present in a significant proportion of cancers. Specifically, germline alterations in DNA repair not only increase cancer risk but are associated with treatment response and clinical outcomes. The therapeutic landscape of cancer has rapidly evolved with the FDA approval of therapies that specifically target DNA repair vulnerabilities. The clinical success of synthetic lethality between BRCA deficiency and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition has been truly revolutionary. Defective mismatch repair has been validated as a predictor of response to immune checkpoint blockade associated with durable responses and long-term benefit in many cancer patients. Advances in next generation sequencing technologies and their decreasing cost have supported increased genetic profiling of tumors coupled with germline testing of cancer risk genes in patients. The clinical adoption of panel testing for germline assessment in high-risk individuals has generated a plethora of genetic data, particularly on DNA repair genes. Here, we highlight the therapeutic relevance of germline aberrations in DNA repair to identify patients eligible for precision treatments such as PARP inhibitors (PARPis), immune checkpoint blockade, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and combined treatment. We also discuss emerging mechanisms that regulate DNA repair. Journal: Cancer treatment reviews. Year: 2022. Authors: Shah SM, Demidova EV, Lesh RW, Hall MJ, Daly MB.

Abstract: The aim of this paper was to identify DNA methylation based biomarkers for predicting overall survival (OS) of stage I-II lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Methylation profile data of patients with stage I-II LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to determine methylation sites-based hallmark for stage I-II LUAD patients' OS. The patients were separated into training and validation datasets by using median risk score as cutoff. Univariate Cox, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox analyses were employed to develop a DNA methylation signature for OS of patients with stage I-II LUAD. As a result, an 11-DNA methylation signature was determined to be critically associated with the OS of patients with stage I-II LUAD. Analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) suggested a high prognostic effectiveness of the 11-DNA methylation signature in patients with stage I-II LUAD (AUC at 1, 3, 5\u00a0years in training set were (0.849, 0.879, 0.831, respectively), validation set (0.742, 0.807, 0.904, respectively), entire TCGA dataset (0.747, 0.818, 0.870, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses exhibited that survival was significantly longer in the low-risk cohort compared to the high-risk cohort in the training dataset (P\u2009=\u20097e\u2009-\u200907), in the validation dataset (P\u2009=\u20091e\u2009-\u200908), and in the all-cohort dataset (P\u2009=\u20096e\u2009-\u200914). In addition, a nomogram was developed based on molecular factor (methylation risk score) as well as clinical factors (age and cancer status) (AUC at 1, 3, 5\u00a0years entire TCGA dataset were 0.770, 0.849, 0.979, respectively). The result verified that our methylomics-associated nomogram had a strong robustness for predicting stage I-II LUAD patients' OS. Furthermore, the nomogram combined clinical and molecular factors to determine an individualized probability of recurrence for patients with stage I-II LUAD, which stood for a major advance in the field of personalized medicine for pulmonary oncology. Collectively, we successfully identified a DNA methylation biomarker and a DNA methylation-based nomogram to predict the OS of patients with stage I-II LUAD. Journal: Scientific reports. Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Modelling human protein interaction networks as metric spaces has potential in disease research and drug target discovery.. Abstract: We have recently shown by formally modelling human protein interaction networks (PINs) as metric spaces and classified proteins into zones based on their distance from the topological centre that hub proteins are primarily centrally located. We also showed that zones closest to the network centre are enriched for critically important proteins and are also functionally very specialised for specific 'house keeping' functions. We proposed that proteins closest to the network centre may present good therapeutic targets. Here, we present multiple pieces of novel functional evidence that provides strong support for this hypothesis. We found that the human PINs has a highly connected signalling core, with the majority of proteins involved in signalling located in the two zones closest to the topological centre. The majority of essential, disease related, tumour suppressor, oncogenic and approved drug target proteins were found to be centrally located. Similarly, the majority of proteins consistently expressed in 13 types of cancer are also predominantly located in zones closest to the centre. Proteins from zones 1 and 2 were also found to comprise the majority of proteins in key KEGG pathways such as MAPK-signalling, the cell cycle, apoptosis and also pathways in cancer, with very similar patterns seen in pathways that lead to cancers such as melanoma and glioma, and non-neoplastic diseases such as measles, inflammatory bowel disease and Alzheimer's disease. Based on the diversity of evidence uncovered, we propose that when considered holistically, proteins located centrally in the human PINs that also have similar functions to existing drug targets are good candidate targets for novel therapeutics. Similarly, since disease pathways are dominated by centrally located proteins, candidates shortlisted in genome scale disease studies can be further prioritized and contextualised based on whether they occupy central positions in the human PINs.

We describe technologies for identification and expression of intracellular antibodies for target validation, intracellular immunization and tumor therapy, such as intracellular antibody capture technology, suicide or silencing technology, antigen-antibody interaction dependent apoptosis and their application for inhibition of oncogenic intracellular proteins and induction of apoptosis. These strategies have to be viewed in the context that inhibition of protein-protein interactions by small molecules is often limited due to their large interaction surface. We summarize antibodies with the ability to penetrate cells and strategies to induce uptake of antibodies after modification with protein transduction domains. Interference in oncogenic pathways is described for moieties based on antibody 3E10, which translocates into the nucleus after extracellular administration. Finally, we discuss examples of tumor immunotherapy and vaccination against intracellular antigens, and possible interactions mediating their mode of action. Journal: Cancer genomics & proteomics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular pathways in invasive bladder cancer: new insights into mechanisms, progression, and target identification.. Abstract: Papillary and invasive cancers of the urinary bladder appear to evolve and progress through distinct molecular pathways. Invasion in bladder cancer forebodes a graver prognosis, and these tumors are generally characterized by alterations in the p53 and retinoblastoma (RB) pathways that normally regulate the cell cycle by interacting with the Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Tumor angiogenesis further contributes to the neoplastic growth by providing a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients. Distinct epigenetic and genetic events characterize the interplay between the molecules involved in these pathways, thus affording their use as indicators of prognosis. Efforts are now underway to construct molecular panels comprising multiple markers that can serve as more robust predictors of outcome. While clinical trials for targeted chemotherapy for bladder cancer have commenced, novel genetic and pharmacologic agents that can target pathway-specific molecules are currently under development. The next generation of clinical management for urothelial carcinoma will witness the use of multimarker panels for prognostic prediction and combination therapy directed at novel molecular targets for treatment.

Abstract: The biogenesis, development and metastases of cancer are associated with many variations in the transcriptome. Alternative splicing of genes is a major post-transcriptional regulation mechanism that is involved in many types of cancer. The next-generation sequencing applied on RNAs (RNA-Seq) provides a new technology for studying transcriptomes. It provides an unprecedented opportunity for quantitatively studying alternative splicing in a systematic way. This mini-review summarizes the current RNA-Seq studies on cancer transcriptomes especially studies on cancer-related alternative splicing, and discusses the strategy for quantitative study of alternative splicing in cancers with RNA-Seq, the bioinformatics methods available and existing questions.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Study of the genomics and transcriptomics profiles of male-infertility genes in human prostate cancer: an <i>in silico</i> analysis.. Abstract: The World Health Organization has considered the infertility as an international public health problem. Infertility affect nearly 1 in 7 couples and male component contributes to 50% of infertility cases. There is a clear link between male infertility and some cancers such as testicular germ cell, prostate and colon cancers. Two possibilities support this finding: 1) Cancer treatments can affect the fertility factors 2) Genetic profile of infertility genes have been altered in cancer patients. Although the previously published researches have mostly focused on the first factor, no article has yet confirmed the role of genetic factors. In this in silico study, we collected the large number of genes (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200917703) involved in infertility. These genes were collected from NGS panel tests of male infertility and comprehensive literature review or online data base. The Prostate Adenocarcinoma genomic and transcriptomics raw data were downloaded from the cBioPortal Cancer dataset. This included with 494 patients of Prostate Cancer with 494 mutation data, 489 with CNA and 493 with RNA seqV2 data. TCGA RNA-Seq raw data was extracted in R using the cgdsr extension package with a threshold of \u00b12 relative to normal samples. The observed data showed that male infertility genes have been distributed through the human genome. Among the 17703 analyzed genes of this study, the genomic profile of three genes including OR9Q1, H4C6 and PSG7 were changed approximately in 100% of (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009493) patients. In most of patients (>98%), genetic alteration was related to change in gene expression. In conclusion, this study showed that the genomic and transcriptomics patterns of some male-infertility genes are notably altered in patients of prostate cancer and suggested a possible role of genetic factors in occurrence of infertility in cancer patients. Our information can be used as a source for the design of genetic database of male-infertility. Journal: Systems biology in reproductive medicine. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Frequent Subgraph Mining of Functional Interaction Patterns Across Multiple Cancers.. Abstract: Molecular mechanisms characterizing cancer development and progression are complex and process through thousands of interacting elements in the cell. Understanding the underlying structure of interactions requires the integration of cellular networks with extensive combinations of dysregulation patterns. Recent pan-cancer studies focused on identifying common dysregulation patterns in a confined set of pathways or targeting a manually curated set of genes. However, the complex nature of the disease presents a challenge for finding pathways that would constitute a basis for tumor progression and requires evaluation of subnetworks with functional interactions. Uncovering these relationships is critical for translational medicine and the identification of future therapeutics. We present a frequent subgraph mining algorithm to find functional dysregulation patterns across the cancer spectrum. We mined frequent subgraphs coupled with biased random walks utilizing genomic alterations, gene expression profiles, and protein-protein interaction networks. In this unsupervised approach, we have recovered expert-curated pathways previously reported for explaining the underlying biology of cancer progression in multiple cancer types. Furthermore, we have clustered the genes identified in the frequent subgraphs into highly connected networks using a greedy approach and evaluated biological significance through pathway enrichment analysis. Gene clusters further elaborated on the inherent heterogeneity of cancer samples by both suggesting specific mechanisms for cancer type and common dysregulation patterns across different cancer types. Survival analysis of sample level clusters also revealed significant differences among cancer types (p < 0.001). These results could extend the current understanding of disease etiology by identifying biologically relevant interactions.Supplementary Information: Supplementary methods, figures, tables and code are available at https://github.com/bebeklab/FSM_Pancancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Development and validation of a four-lipid metabolism gene signature for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.. Abstract: Abnormal lipid metabolism is closely related to the malignant biological behavior of tumor cells. Such abnormal lipid metabolism provides energy for rapid proliferation, and certain genes related to lipid metabolism encode important components of tumor signaling pathways. In this study, we analyzed pancreatic cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and searched for prognostic genes related to lipid metabolism in the Molecular Signature Database. A risk score model was built and verified using the GSE57495 dataset and International Cancer Genome Consortium dataset. Four molecular subtypes and 4249 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The DEGs obtained by Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Construction analysis were intersected with 4249 DEGs to obtain a total of 1340 DEGs. The final prognosis model included CA8, CEP55, GNB3 and SGSM2, and these had a significant effect on overall survival. The area under the curve at 1, 3 and 5\u2009years was 0.72, 0.79 and 0.87, respectively. These same results were obtained using the validation cohort. Survival analysis data showed that the model could stratify the prognosis of patients with different clinical characteristics, and the model has clinical independence. Functional analysis indicated that the model is associated with multiple cancer-related pathways. Compared with published models, our model has a higher C-index and greater risk value. In summary, this four-gene signature is an independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer survival and may be an effective prognostic indicator. Journal: FEBS open bio. Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Reconciling environment-mediated metabolic heterogeneity with the oncogene-driven cancer paradigm in precision oncology.. Abstract: Precision oncology is the practice of matching one therapy to one specific patient, based on particular genetic tumor alterations, in order to achieve the best clinical response. Despite an expanding arsenal of targeted therapies, many patients still have a poor outcome because tumor cells show a remarkable capacity to develop drug resistance, thereby leading to tumor relapse. Besides genotype-driven resistance mechanisms, tumor microenvironment (TME) peculiarities strongly contribute to generate an intratumoral phenotypic heterogeneity that affects disease progression and treatment outcome. In this Review, we describe how TME-mediated metabolic heterogeneities actively participate to therapeutic failure. We report how a lactate-based metabolic symbiosis acts as a mechanism of adaptive resistance to targeted therapies and we describe the role of mitochondrial metabolism, in particular oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), to support the growth and survival of therapy-resistant tumor cells in a variety of cancers. Finally, we detail potential metabolism-interfering therapeutic strategies aiming to eradicate OXPHOS-dependent relapse-sustaining malignant cells and we discuss relevant (pre)clinical models that may help integrate TME-driven metabolic heterogeneity in precision oncology.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is a significant health concern and the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide. Understanding the complex process of prostate tumor evolution and progression is crucial for improved diagnosis, treatments, and patient outcomes. Previous studies have focused on unraveling the dynamics of prostate cancer evolution using phylogenetic or lineage analysis approaches. However, those approaches have limitations in capturing the complete disease process or incorporating genomic and transcriptomic variations comprehensively. In this study, we applied a novel computational approach to derive a prostate cancer progression model using multidimensional data from 497 prostate tumor samples and 52 tumor-adjacent normal samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas study. The model was validated using data from an independent cohort of 545 primary tumor samples. By integrating transcriptomic and genomic data, our model provides a comprehensive view of prostate tumor progression, identifies crucial signaling pathways and genetic events, and uncovers distinct transcription signatures associated with disease progression. Our findings have significant implications for cancer research and hold promise for guiding personalized treatment strategies in prostate cancer. We developed and validated a progression model of prostate cancer using >1,000 tumor and normal tissue samples. The model provided a comprehensive view of prostate tumor evolution and progression.

Comprehensive transcriptome profiling offers critical insights into the disease and reveal new avenue for drug discovery. Total 5 cancerous and histopathological normal tissue pairs of 5 OSCC patients included in the petite study. Transcriptome sequencing was performed using Roche's 454 sequencing platform followed by CLC Genomics Workbench was used to examine gene expression in OC development. A total 2082 genes were differentially expressed across all the five tumor-control pairs collected from the OC patients during the surgery. From these 1092 upregulated and 273 downregulated genes, whereas 717 genes were found to be non-significant. The genes with pvalue <0.05 and log2foldchange > 1 or log2foldchange < -1 were considered for further enrichment analysis. Topfunn was used for gene enrichment analysis to identify gene enrichment pathway analysis found some cancer related pathways such as TNF signaling, p53 signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, Apelin signaling pathway and IL-17 signaling pathway were strikingly involved in proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells. The PPI network construction was performed and identified 8 best protein interactions.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Current advances in microbial-based cancer therapies.. Abstract: Microbes have an immense metabolic capability and can adapt to a wide variety of environments; as a result, they share complicated relationships with cancer. The goal of microbial-based cancer therapy is to treat patients with cancers that are not easily treatable, by using tumor-specific infectious microorganisms. Nevertheless, a number of difficulties have been encountered as a result of the harmful effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and alternative cancer therapies, such as the toxicity to non-cancerous cells, the inability of medicines to penetrate deep tumor tissue, and the ongoing problem of rising drug resistance in tumor cells. Due to these difficulties, there is now a larger need for designing alternative strategies that are more effective and selective when targeting tumor cells. The fight against cancer has advanced significantly owing to cancer immunotherapy. The researchers have greatly benefited from their understanding of tumor-invading immune cells as well as the immune responses that are specifically targeted against cancer. Application of bacterial and viral cancer therapeutics offers promising potential to be employed as cancer treatments among immunotherapies. As a novel therapeutic strategy, microbial targeting of tumors has been created to address the persisting hurdles of cancer treatment. This review outlines the mechanisms by which both bacteria and viruses target and inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells. Their ongoing clinical trials and possible modifications that can be made in the future have also been addressed in the following sections. These microbial-based cancer medicines have the ability to suppress cancer that builds up and multiplies in the tumor microenvironment and triggers antitumor immune responses, in contrast to other cancer medications.

Abstract: The development of an aptamer-based therapeutic has rapidly progressed following the first two reports in the 1990s, underscoring the advantages of aptamer drugs associated with their unique binding properties. In 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first therapeutic aptamer for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, Macugen developed by NeXstar. Since then, eleven aptamers have successfully entered clinical trials for various therapeutic indications. Despite some of the pre-clinical and clinical successes of aptamers as therapeutics, no aptamer has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer. This review highlights the most recent and cutting-edge approaches in the development of aptamers for the treatment of cancer types most refractory to conventional therapies. Herein, we will review (1) the development of aptamers to enhance anti-cancer immunity and as delivery tools for inducing the expression of immunogenic neoantigens; (2) the development of the most promising therapeutic aptamers designed to target the hard-to-treat cancers such as brain tumors; and (3) the development of \"carrier\" aptamers able to target and penetrate tumors and metastasis, delivering RNA therapeutics to the cytosol and nucleus.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Unveiling spatial heterogeneity in medulloblastoma: A multi-omics analysis of cellular state and geographical organization.. Abstract: Despite numerous studies on medulloblastoma (MB) cell heterogeneity, the spatial characteristics of cellular states remain unclear. We analyze single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility from human MB spanning four subgroups, to identify malignant cell populations and describe the spatial evolutionary trajectories. The spatial copy number variations (CNVs) patterns and niches were analyzed to investigate the cellular interactions. Three main malignant cell populations were identified, including progenitor-like, cycling, and differentiated populations. Gene signatures of cell populations strongly correlate to clinical outcomes. These tumor cell populations are geographically organized as stem-like and mature regions, highlighting their spatially heterogeneous nature. Progenitor-like and cycling cells are mainly concentrated in stem-like regions, whereas various differentiated populations are primarily distributed in mature regions. By analyzing chromosomal alterations, we find that stem-like regions typically harbor a single pattern of CNVs, reflecting high originality and uniformity, which is in stark contrast to mature regions exhibiting multiple patterns with a broader range of biological functions. Projecting cellular state programs onto spatial sections fully illustrates the evolution from stem-like regions to various functional zones in mature regions, which is correlated to microenvironmental components along the paths to maintain stemness or promote differentiation. This multi-omics database comprehensively facilitates the understanding of MB spatial evolutionary organization. Journal: Neuro-oncology. Year: 2025. Authors: Li J, Liu H, Wang Z, Zhang J, Chen X.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Novel insights into breast cancer genetic variance through RNA sequencing.. Abstract: Using RNA sequencing of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-TBNC and HER2-positive breast cancer sub-types, here we report novel expressed variants, allelic prevalence and abundance, and coexpression with other variation, and splicing signatures. To reveal the most prevalent variant alleles, we overlaid our findings with cancer- and population-based datasets and validated a subset of novel variants of cancer-related genes: ESRP2, GBP1, TPP1, MAD2L1BP, GLUD2 and SLC30A8. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrated that a rare substitution in the splicing coordinator ESRP2 (R353Q) impairs its ability to bind to its substrate FGFR2 pre-mRNA. In addition, we describe novel SNPs and INDELs in cancer relevant genes with no prior reported association of point mutations with cancer, such as MTAP and MAGED1. For the first time, this study illustrates the power of RNA-sequencing in revealing the variation landscape of breast transcriptome and exemplifies analytical strategies to search regulatory interactions among cancer relevant molecules.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Carvacrol as a Prospective Regulator of Cancer Targets/Signalling Pathways.. Abstract: Carvacrol is a naturally occurring phenolic isopropyl monoterpene isolated from oregano, thyme, pepperwort, ajwain, marjoram, and wild bergamot. It possesses pharmacological activities, including anticancer, anti-genotoxic, and anti-inflammation associated with antioxidant properties. The antioxidant property of carvacrol is found to be accountable for its anticancer property. Thus, the present review summarizes and discusses the anticancer potential of carvacrol, revealing its target, signalling pathways, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. Carvacrol showed promising activity to be considered in more detail for cancer treatment. This review aims to summarize the evidence concerning the understanding of anticancer potential of carvacrol. However, the mode of action of carvacrol is not yet fully explored and hence requires detailed exploratory studies. This review consists of carvacol's in vitro, in vivo, preclinical and clinical studies. A literature search was done by searching various online databases like Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar with the specific keyword \"Carvacrol,\" along with other keywords, such as \"antioxidant properties,\" \"oncology research,\" \"genotoxicity,\" and \"anti-inflammatory property\". Carvacrol possesses weak mutagenic and genotoxic potential at non-toxic doses. Carvacrol alone shows the potential to target cancerous cells and significantly deter the growth of cancer cells; this is a targeted method. It offers anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing oxidative stress, primarily targeting ER and mitochondria. Carvacrol depicts targeted explicitly ROSdependent and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in different cancer cells. Moreover, carvacrol significantly regulates the cell cycle and prevents tumor progression. Few reports also suggest its significant role in inhibiting cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis in tumor cells. Hence, carvacrol affects cell survival and cell-killing activity by targeting key biomarkers and major signalling pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK, STAT3, and Notch. Until now, its anticancer mechanism is not yet fully explored. A limited number of research studies have been conducted on carvacrol. It possesses both cancer prevention and cancer therapeutic properties. This molecule needs more validatory research so that it can be analyzed precisely. Journal: Current molecular pharmacology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: SFyNCS detects oncogenic fusions involving non-coding sequences in cancer.. Abstract: Fusion genes are well-known cancer drivers. However, most known oncogenic fusions are protein-coding, and very few involve non-coding sequences due to lack of suitable detection tools. We develop SFyNCS to detect fusions of both protein-coding genes and non-coding sequences from transcriptomic sequencing data. The main advantage of this study is that we use somatic structural variations detected from genomic data to validate fusions detected from transcriptomic data. This allows us to comprehensively evaluate various fusion detection and filtering strategies and parameters. We show that SFyNCS has superior sensitivity and specificity over existing algorithms through extensive benchmarking in cancer cell lines and patient samples. We then apply SFyNCS to 9565 tumor samples across 33 tumor types in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort and detect a total of 165,139 fusions. Among them, 72% of the fusions involve non-coding sequences. We find a long non-coding RNA to recurrently fuse with various oncogenes in 3% of prostate cancers. In addition, we discover fusions involving two non-coding RNAs in 32% of dedifferentiated liposarcomas and experimentally validated the oncogenic functions in mouse model.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Multi-omic landscape of human gliomas from diagnosis to treatment and recurrence.. Abstract: Gliomas are among the most lethal cancers, with limited treatment options. To uncover hallmarks of therapeutic escape and tumor microenvironment (TME) landscape, we applied spatial proteomics, transcriptomics, and glycomics to 670 lesions from 310 adult and pediatric patients. Single-cell analysis shows high B7H3+ tumor cell prevalence in glioblastoma (GBM) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, while most gliomas, including pediatric cases, express targetable tumor antigens in less than 50% of tumor cells, potentially explaining trial failures. Paired samples of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas reveal recurrence driven by tumor-immune spatial reorganization, shifting from T cell and vasculature-associated myeloid cell-enriched niches to microglia and CD206<sup>+</sup> macrophage-dominated tumors. Multi-omic integration identified N-glycosylation as the best classifier of grade, while the immune transcriptome best predicted GBM survival. Provided as a community resource, this study offers a framework for glioma targeting, classification, outcome prediction, and a baseline of TME composition across all stages. Journal: Cancer cell.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cucurbitacin-B inhibits cancer cell migration by targeting mortalin and HDM2: computational and <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> experimental evidence.. Abstract: Cancer metastasis, a highly complex process wherein cancer cells move from the primary site to other sites in the body, is a major hurdle in its therapeutics. A large array of synthetic chemotherapeutic molecules used for the treatment of metastatic cancers, besides being extremely expensive and unaffordable, are known to cause severe adverse effects leading to poor quality of life (QOL) of the patients. In this premise, natural compounds (considered safe, easily available and economic) that possess the potential to inhibit migration of cancer cells are deemed useful and hence are on demand. Cucurbitacin-B (19-(10\u21929\u03b2)-abeo-10-lanost-5-ene triterpene, called Cuc-B) is a steroid mostly found in plants of Cucurbitaceae family. It has been shown to possess anticancer activity although the molecular mechanism remains poorly defined. We present evidence that Cuc-B has the ability to interact with mortalin and HDM2 proteins that are enriched in cancer cells, suppress wild type p53 function and promote cancer cell migration. Computational analyses showed that Cuc-B interacts with mortalin similar to MKT077 and Withanone, both have been shown to reactivate p53 function and inhibit cell migration. Furthermore, Cuc-B interacted with HDM2 similar to Y30, a well-known inhibitor of HDM2. Experimental cell and molecular analyses demonstrated the downregulation of several proteins, critically involved in cell migration in Cuc-B (low non-toxic doses)-treated cancer cells and exhibited inhibition of cell migration. The data suggested that Cuc-B is a potential natural drug that warrants further mechanistic and clinical studies for its use in the management of metastatic cancers.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Abstract: Although platinum-based chemotherapy continues to be the first-line option for advanced ovarian cancer and for platinum recurrences beyond 6\u00a0months, platinum rechallenge is not the best approach for some patients, such as those with residual toxicities, platinum-related hypersensitivity reactions or limited platinum-sensitivity (i.e., a platinum treatment-free interval [TFIp] of 6-12\u00a0months). Results of the MITO-8 study called into question the role of single-agent nonplatinum-based regimens in this specific subset of ovarian cancer patients. The current article summarizes the results of the MITO-8 study highlighting key limitations, and discusses the role of the nonplatinum-based combination of trabectedin\u00a0+\u00a0pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in the management of ovarian cancer patients who relapse between 6 and 12\u00a0months after last platinum.

Abstract: The differences in features and risk factors for recurrence after definitive surgical excision are yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to understand these factors influencing recurrence patterns with local and regional disease in these patients. A total of 365 relapsed patients, of whom 196 presented with local disease (stage I-II) and 169 with regional disease (stage III), were investigated in this retrospective study. The median time to initial recurrence for stage I-II and stage III patients was 22.3 and 13.4\u00a0months, respectively. Stage III patients were found to have higher Clark levels (p\u2009=\u20090.0001) and thicker lesions (p\u2009=\u20090.0001), and they were more significantly associated with the absence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (p\u2009=\u20090.02) than stage I-II patients. Stage III patients were more significantly associated with recurrences compared to the stage I-II patients (p\u2009=\u20090.0001). Locoregional relapses were significantly associated with stage I-II melanomas, whereas majority of the distant metastases occurred in stage III patients (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Pulmonary metastasis was most frequently observed and the distribution of the sites for distant metastases was similar in both groups of the patients. On univariate analysis, male sex, increased tumor depth, presence of ulceration, nodular histopathology, higher Clark level, higher mitotic rate, and presence of lymphovascular invasions were found to predict shorter time to relapse for stage I-II patients; whereas only nodular pathology, presence of ulceration, and high mitotic rate were found to be associated with poor relapse-free survival in stage III patients. However, on multivariate analysis, only mitotic rate maintained its significance for both clinical staging groups. Potential differences among early-stage melanoma patients, who developed recurrence, were noted and mitotic rate was found as the single significant prognostic factor for recurrence in both stage I-II and III patients.

Abstract: An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed in 103 unselected patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) comparing early relapse (<12 months) or failure of first-line therapy (ER/FTF) with late relapses (LR). Seventy one percentage proceeded to high-dose therapy/autologous stem cell rescue (HDT/ASCR) following salvage treatment. By ITT, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 50% for ER/FTF compared to 73% for LR patients (P = 0\u00b7012). However OS was equivalent for both groups if salvage treatment response was adequate to proceed to HDT/ASCR. ER/FTF patients remain a high-risk group largely due to a failure of salvage therapy: a point at which novel interventions could impact survival. Journal: British journal of haematology. Year: 2012.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The targets of aspirin in bladder cancer: bioinformatics analysis.. Abstract: The anti-carcinogenic properties of aspirin have been observed in some solid tumors. However, the molecular mechanism of therapeutic effects of aspirin on bladder cancer is still indistinct. We introduced a bioinformatics analysis approach, to explore the targets of aspirin in bladder cancer (BC). To find out the potential targets of aspirin in BC, we analyzed direct protein targets (DPTs) of aspirin in Drug Bank 5.0. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and signaling pathway of aspirin DPTs were then analyzed subsequently. A detailed analysis of the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway has shown that aspirin is linked to BC. We identified overexpressed genes in BC comparing with normal samples by Oncomine and genes that interlinked with aspirin target genes in BC by STRING. Firstly, we explored 16 direct protein targets (DPT) of aspirin. We analyzed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and signaling pathways of aspirin DPT. We found that aspirin is closely associated with a variety of cancers, including BC. Then, we classified mutations in 3 aspirin DPTs (CCND1, MYC and TP53) in BC using the cBio Portal database. In addition, we extracted the top 50 overexpressed genes in bladder cancer by Oncomine and predicted the genes associated with the 3 aspirin DPTs (CCND1, MYC and TP53) in BC by STRING. Finally, 5 exact genes were identified as potential therapeutic targets of aspirin in bladder cancer. The analysis of relevant databases will improve our mechanistic understanding of the role of aspirin in bladder cancer. This will guide the direction of our next drug-disease interaction studies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular and functional landscape of malignant serous effusions for precision oncology.. Abstract: Personalized treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors critically depends on the deep characterization of tumor cells from patient biopsies. Here, we comprehensively characterize a pan-cancer cohort of 150 malignant serous effusion (MSE) samples at the cellular, molecular, and functional level. We find that MSE-derived cancer cells retain the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of their corresponding primary tumors, validating their use as a patient-relevant model system for solid tumor biology. Integrative analyses reveal that baseline gene expression patterns relate to global ex vivo drug sensitivity, while high-throughput drug-induced transcriptional changes in MSE samples are indicative of drug mode of action and acquired treatment resistance. A case study exemplifies the added value of multi-modal MSE profiling for patients who lack genetically stratified treatment options. In summary, our study provides a functional multi-omics view on a pan-cancer solid tumor cohort and underlines the feasibility and utility of MSE-based precision oncology.

Abstract: The aims of the present study were to characterize the PANoptosis signature in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients, construct a novel model to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment, and further explore the associated molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. In total, 85 PANoptosis-related genes that possess both PANoptosis and multi-omics features were, respectively, screened from transcriptomic data from the OEP001105 public cohort and from transcriptomic and proteomic sequencing data from The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. A novel framework integrating Cox regression analysis and 5 machine learning algorithms was developed to identify the 5 hub genes (POSTN, SFN, MYOF, HOGA1, and PECR). The subsequently constructed PANoptosis risk score demonstrates outstanding performance in predicting prognosis and clinical translation across multicenter cohorts with multi-omics profiling. Bulk and single-cell transcriptome profiling were used to investigate the tumor microenvironment, emphasizing the crucial role of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment of ICCs. Moreover, a positive spatial correlation of cancer-associated fibroblasts-derived POSTN expression with tumor-associated macrophages infiltration and PD-L1/PD-L2 expression in ICC patients was observed, suggesting that overexpression of POSTN may lead to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in ICC patients. The present study identified a precise prognostic and treatment strategy for ICC patients prone to PANoptosis, investigated the molecular mechanisms of PANoptosis in ICC cells, and highlighted the potential clinical relevance of the PANoptosis risk score in predicting prognosis and therapy response. These findings will help guide clinical treatment strategies for ICC. Journal: Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.). Year: 2026. Authors: Yu Y, You Y, Duan Y, Kang M, Zhou B.

Abstract: The 5th Workshop IRE on Translational Oncology was held in Rome (Italy) on 27-28 March at the IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute. This meeting entitled \"The New World of RNA diagnostics and therapeutics\" highlightes the significant progress in the RNA field made over the last years. Research moved from pure discovery towards the development of diagnostic biomarkers or RNA-base targeted therapies seeking validation in several clinical trials. Non-coding RNAs in particular have been the focus of this workshop due to their unique properties that make them attractive tools for the diagnosis and therapy of cancer.This report collected the presentations of many scientists from different institutions that discussed recent oncology research providing an excellent overview and representative examples for each possible application of RNA as biomarker, for therapy or to increase the number of patients that can benefit from precision oncology treatment.In particular, the meeting specifically emphasized two key features of RNA applications: RNA diagnostic (Blandino, Palcau, Sestito, D\u00edaz M\u00e9ndez, Cappelletto, Pulito, Monteonofrio, Calin, Sozzi, Cheong) and RNA therapeutics (Dinami, Marcia, Anastasiadou, Ryan, Fattore, Regazzo, Loria, Aharonov).

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Subtypes of breast cancer show preferential site of relapse.. Abstract: We explored whether the five previously reported molecular subtypes in breast cancer show a preference for organ-specific relapse and searched for molecular pathways involved. The \"intrinsic\" gene list describing the subtypes was used to classify 344 primary breast tumors of lymph node-negative patients. Fisher exact tests were used to determine the association between a tumor subtype and a particular site of distant relapse in these patients who only received local treatment. Modulated genes and pathways were identified in the various groups using Significance Analysis of Microarrays and Global Testing. Bone relapse patients were most abundant in the luminal subtypes but were found less than expected in the basal subtype. The reverse was true for lung and brain relapse patients with the remark that absence of lung relapse was luminal A specific. Finally, a pleura relapse, although rare, was found almost exclusively in both luminal subtypes. Many differentially expressed genes were identified, of which several were in common in a subtype and the site to which the subtype preferentially relapsed. WNT signaling was up-regulated in the basal subtype and in brain-specific relapse, and down-modulated in the luminal B subtype and in bone-specific relapse. Focal adhesion was found up-regulated in the luminal A subtype but down-regulated in lung relapse. The five major molecular subtypes in breast cancer are evidently different with regard to their ability to metastasize to distant organ(s), and share biological features and pathways with their preferred distant metastatic site.

Abstract: To evaluate patterns of relapse and outcome in patients newly diagnosed with CNS Mixed Malignant GCT (MMGCT) treated initially with chemotherapy alone. A retrospective chart review was conducted using all 25 patients enrolled on the International CNS GCT Study III, with at least 7 years follow-up for all surviving patients. Thirteen patients at diagnosis had CNS MMGCT by pathology and tumor markers (n = 11), or tumor markers alone (n = 2). Twelve received chemotherapy alone, one additionally receiving focal irradiation prior to relapse. Six patients (46%) relapsed (mean of 30.5 months; range 6-59 months), two beyond and four within the primary site alone. Three patients relapsed early (6-23 months from diagnosis), two with alpha-fetoprotein elevations and one without tumor markers assessed; all three expired of progressive disease at 2-10 months following initial relapse. Three patients relapsed late (37-59 months) without AFP elevations, one with pathologically pure germinoma, two with mild beta-human chorionic gonadotropin elevations; these patients survive disease-free at 86+, 94+, and 126+ months following additional treatment. Patients with CNS MMGCT relapsing following chemotherapy alone display two distinct patterns of recurrence and outcome; patients relapsing early possess MMGCT elements and have a dismal prognosis, while patients relapsing late do so with pure germinomatous elements and have an excellent outcome. Current cooperative group studies utilizing more localized fields of irradiation should monitor closely the patterns of relapse and outcome; late recurrences with germinomatous elements might be avoided by initial use of low-dose larger field irradiation in select patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Factors influencing survival after relapse from acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Children's Oncology Group study.. Abstract: Despite great progress in curing childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), survival after relapse remains poor. We analyzed survival after relapse among 9585 pediatric patients enrolled on Children's Oncology Group clinical trials between 1988 and 2002. A total of 1961 patients (20.5%) experienced relapse at any site. The primary end point was survival. Patients were subcategorized by the site of relapse and timing of relapse from initial diagnosis. Time to relapse remains the strongest predictor of survival. Patients experiencing early relapse less than 18 months from initial diagnosis had a particularly poor outcome with a 5-year survival estimate of 21.0+/-1.8%. Standard risk patients who relapsed had improved survival compared with their higher risk counterparts; differences in survival for the two risk groups was most pronounced for patients relapsing after 18 months. Adjusting for both time and relapse site, multivariate analysis showed that age (10+ years) and the presence of central nervous system disease at diagnosis, male gender, and T-cell disease were significant predictors of inferior post-relapse survival. It can be noted that there was no difference in survival rates for relapsed patients in earlier vs later era trials. New therapeutic strategies are urgently needed for children with relapsed ALL and efforts should focus on discovering the biological pathways that mediate drug resistance. Journal: Leukemia.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: p53, cathepsin D, Bcl-2 are joint prognostic indicators of breast cancer metastatic spreading.. Abstract: Traditional prognostic indicators of breast cancer, i.e. lymph node diffusion, tumor size, grading and estrogen receptor expression, are inadequate predictors of metastatic relapse. Thus, additional prognostic parameters appear urgently needed. Individual oncogenic determinants have largely failed in this endeavour. Only a few individual tumor growth drivers, e.g. mutated p53, Her-2, E-cadherin, Trops, did reach some prognostic/predictive power in clinical settings. As multiple factors are required to drive solid tumor progression, clusters of such determinants were expected to become stronger indicators of tumor aggressiveness and malignant progression than individual parameters. To identify such prognostic clusters, we went on to coordinately analyse molecular and histopathological determinants of tumor progression of post-menopausal breast cancers in the framework of a multi-institutional case series/case-control study. A multi-institutional series of 217 breast cancer cases was analyzed. Twenty six cases (12\u00a0%) showed disease relapse during follow-up. Relapsed cases were matched with a set of control patients by tumor diameter, pathological stage, tumor histotype, age, hormone receptors and grading. Histopathological and molecular determinants of tumor development and aggressiveness were then analyzed in relapsed versus non-relapsed cases. Stepwise analyses and model structure fitness assessments were carried out to identify clusters of molecular alterations with differential impact on metastatic relapse. p53, Bcl-2 and cathepsin D were shown to be coordinately associated with unique levels of relative risk for disease relapse. As many Ras downstream targets, among them matrix metalloproteases, are synergistically upregulated by mutated p53, whole-exon sequence analyses were performed for TP53, Ki-RAS and Ha-RAS, and findings were correlated with clinical phenotypes. Notably, TP53 insertion/deletion mutations were only detected in relapsed cases. Correspondingly, Ha-RAS missense oncogenic mutations were only found in a subgroup of relapsing tumors. We have identified clusters of specific molecular alterations that greatly improve prognostic assessment with respect to singularly-analysed indicators. The combined analysis of these multiple tumor-relapse risk factors promises to become a powerful approach to identify patients subgroups with unfavourable disease outcome. Journal: BMC cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Altering Landscape of Cancer Vaccines: Unique Platforms, Research on Therapeutic Applications and Recent Patents.. Abstract: Recent developments in several areas are rekindling interest and empowering progress in improving therapeutic cancer vaccines. These advances have been made in target selection, vaccine technology, and approaches for reversing the immunosuppressive mechanisms exploited by cancers. Studies on diverse tumor antigens have revealed target properties, including high cell specificity and adequate immunogenicity, to affect clinical efficiency. Therefore, one of the principal goals of cancer vaccinology is the development of efficient therapeutic cancer vaccines that are capable of eliciting an effector as well as memory T cell response specific to tumor antigens. Neoantigens, which arise from mutated proteins in cancer cells, are cancer-specific and may be highly immunogenic. However, the vast majority of these are distinctive to each patient's cancer and hence require the development of personalised therapies. Novel immunotherapeutic strategies are focused on breaking immune tolerance to tumor antigens, improving the immunogenicity of tumor vaccines, in addition to overcoming mechanisms of tumor escape. However, current developments and patents in cancer immune therapies, together with associated technologies, are significant. Supreme achievements in immune inhibitor-centered therapies and neo-antigen identification tools envisage probable improvements in cancer vaccines with respect to treatments of malignancies. Antibody modulation of T cell function through checkpoint blockade or co-stimulatory activation may restore survival, proliferation, and effector function. Thus, these tumor-infiltrating T cells with genetically engineered therapeutic vaccines have the potential to act as curative cancer immune therapeutics. In this review, target tumor antigens employed in recent years in the development of therapeutic cancer vaccine approaches are described, and the patents involved in the process are highlighted.

Abstract: Minimal residual disease (MRD) quantified after induction treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) predicts risk of relapse. It has been assumed that early relapses derive from a residual population of leukemic cells, which is still present after induction and that relapsed disease will consequently be more resistant to treatment. To test these hypotheses, we performed a prospective study on patients treated according to the frontline-trial ALL-BFM 2000, which used MRD response for risk-group stratification. Patients (n=45) showed a median time to relapse of 1.5 years. In 89% of patients at least one T-cell-receptor/immunoglobulin gene rearrangement chosen for initial MRD quantification remained stable; however, at least one of the preferred markers for MRD stratification at relapse was different to diagnosis in 50% of patients. A similar proportion of very early, early and late relapses appeared to gain a marker at relapse although backtracking-analysis revealed that in 77% of cases, the gained markers were present as small sub-clones at initial diagnosis. Comparing initial and relapse MRD response to induction, 38% of patients showed a similar, 38% a better and 25% a poorer response after relapse. These data demonstrate an unexpectedly high clonal heterogeneity among very early/early relapses and challenge some current assumptions about relapsed ALL. Journal: Leukemia. Year: 2011.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: It's all downstream from here: RTK/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway resistance mechanisms in glioblastoma.. Abstract: The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is one of the most tumorigenic pathways in cancer, with its hyperactivation strongly linked to the aggressive nature of glioblastoma (GBM). Although extensive research has focused on developing therapeutics targeting this pathway, clinical success remains elusive due to the emergence of resistance mechanisms. This review investigates how inhibition of the RTK/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway alters transcription factors, contributing to acquired resistance mechanisms in GBM. It also highlights the critical role of transcription factor dysregulation in therapeutic resistance. Findings from key studies on the RTK/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in GBM were synthesized to explore the role of transcription factor dysregulation in resistance to targeted therapies, radiation, and chemotherapy. The review highlights that transcription factors undergo significant dysregulation following RTK/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway inhibition, contributing to therapeutic resistance. Transcription factors are promising targets for overcoming treatment resistance in GBM, with cotreatment strategies combining RTK/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway inhibitors and transcription factor-targeted therapies presenting a novel approach. Despite the challenges of targeting complex structures and interactions, advancements in drug development and precision technologies hold great potential. Continued research is essential to refine these strategies and improve outcomes for GBM and other aggressive cancers. Journal: Journal of neuro-oncology. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Understanding epithelial lineages of breast cancer and genotype-phenotype relationships requires direct measurements of the genome and transcriptome of the same single cells at scale. To achieve this, we developed wellDR-seq, a high-genomic-resolution, high-throughput method to simultaneously profile the genome and transcriptome of thousands of single cells. We profiled 33,646 single cells from 12 estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancers and identified ancestral subclones in multiple patients that showed a luminal hormone-responsive lineage, indicating a potential cell of origin. In contrast to bulk studies, wellDR-seq enabled the study of subclone-level gene-dosage relationships, which showed near-linear correlations in large chromosomal segments and extensive variation at the single-gene level. We identified dosage-sensitive and dosage-insensitive genes, including many breast cancer genes as well as sporadic copy-number aberrations in non-cancer cells. Overall, these data reveal complex relationships between copy number and gene expression in single cells, improving our understanding of breast cancer progression. Journal: Cell. Year: 2025.

Abstract: The tumorigenesis of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (siNETs) is not understood and comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic data sets are limited. Therefore, we performed whole genome and transcriptome analysis of 39 well differentiated siNET samples. Our genomic data revealed a lack of recurrent driver mutations and demonstrated that multifocal siNETs from individual patients can arise genetically independently. We detected germline mutations in Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway (FANC) genes, involved in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, in 9% of patients and found mutational signatures of defective HR DNA repair in late-stage tumor evolution. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed low expression of the transcriptional repressor REST. Summarizing, we identify a novel common transcriptomic signature of siNETs and demonstrate that genomic alterations alone do not explain initial tumor formation, while impaired DNA repair likely contributes to tumor evolution and represents a potential pharmaceutical target in a subset of patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Pan-Cancer Mutational and Transcriptional Analysis of the Integrator Complex.. Abstract: The integrator complex has been recently identified as a key regulator of RNA Polymerase II-mediated transcription, with many functions including the processing of small nuclear RNAs, the pause-release and elongation of polymerase during the transcription of protein coding genes, and the biogenesis of enhancer derived transcripts. Moreover, some of its components also play a role in genome maintenance. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that their functional impairment or altered expression can contribute to malignancies. Indeed, several studies have described the mutations or transcriptional alteration of some Integrator genes in different cancers. Here, to draw a comprehensive pan-cancer picture of the genomic and transcriptomic alterations for the members of the complex, we reanalyzed public data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Somatic mutations affecting Integrator subunit genes and their transcriptional profiles have been investigated in about 11,000 patients and 31 tumor types. A general heterogeneity in the mutation frequencies was observed, mostly depending on tumor type. Despite the fact that we could not establish them as cancer drivers, <i>INTS7</i> and <i>INTS8</i> genes were highly mutated in specific cancers. A transcriptome analysis of paired (normal and tumor) samples revealed that the transcription of <i>INTS7</i>, <i>INTS8</i>, and <i>INTS13</i> is significantly altered in several cancers. Experimental validation performed on primary tumors confirmed these findings. Journal: International journal of molecular sciences. Year: 2017.

Abstract: Primary aim was to assess relapse\u2011free survival (RFS) in patients with clinical stage I (CS I) of non-seminomatous germ cell testicular tumors (NSGCTT) undergoing surveillance after orchiectomy. The secondary aim was to examine differences in risk factors in patients with early relapse (ER 2 years) and very late relapse (VLR > 5 years). Cross-sectional study analyzed 25\u2011year single\u2011center experiences with 198 CS I NSGCTT patients according the time to relapse. RFS was 160/198 (80.8 %). Relapse occurred in 38 (19.2 %) patients after a median fol-low-up of 7.57 months, 33 (86.8 %) patients had ER after a median follow-up of 7.03 months and 5 patients had LR (13.2 %) after a median follow-up of 26.28 months. One patient (2.63 %) had VLR after follow-up > 5 years (7.17 years). Three relapsed patients died with metastatic disease after a mean follow-up of 5.1 years from the date of diagnosis. Another three patients died without cancer after a mean follow-up of two years. OS was 192/198 (97 %). Diagnosis and treatment of late relapsing NSGCTT patients should be performed in experienced centers only. Occurrence of LR is the reason for long-term monitoring of NSGCTT survivors (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref. 14). Journal: Bratislavske lekarske listy. Year: 2018.

Abstract: Alterations in membrane proteins (MPs) and their regulated pathways have been established as cancer hallmarks and extensively targeted in clinical applications. However, the analysis of MP-interacting proteins and downstream pathways across human malignancies remains challenging. Here, we present a systematically integrated method to generate a resource of cancer membrane protein-regulated networks (CaMPNets), containing 63,746 high-confidence protein-protein interactions (PPIs) for 1962 MPs, using expression profiles from 5922 tumors with overall survival outcomes across 15 human cancers. Comprehensive analysis of CaMPNets links MP partner communities and regulated pathways to provide MP-based gene sets for identifying prognostic biomarkers and druggable targets. For example, we identify CHRNA9 with 12 PPIs (e.g., ERBB2) can be a therapeutic target and find its anti-metastasis agent, bupropion, for treatment in nicotine-induced breast cancer. This resource is a study to systematically integrate MP interactions, genomics, and clinical outcomes for helping illuminate cancer-wide atlas and prognostic landscapes in tumor homo/heterogeneity.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase blockade potentiates tyrosine kinase inhibitor effect on breast cancer cells through autophagy perturbation.. Abstract: Glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) correlated to cancer progression and drug resistance. We previously showed that G6PD inhibition leads to Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress often associated to autophagy deregulation. The latter can be induced by target-based agents such as Lapatinib, an anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) largely used in breast cancer treatment. Here we investigate whether G6PD inhibition causes autophagy alteration, which can potentiate Lapatinib effect on cancer cells. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry for LC3B and lysosomes tracker were used to study autophagy in cells treated with lapatinib and/or G6PD inhibitors (polydatin). Immunoblots for LC3B and p62 were performed to confirm autophagy flux analyses together with puncta and colocalization studies. We generated a cell line overexpressing G6PD and performed synergism studies on cell growth inhibition induced by Lapatinib and Polydatin using the median effect by Chou-Talay. Synergism studies were additionally validated with apoptosis analysis by annexin V/PI staining in the presence or absence of autophagy blockers. We found that the inhibition of G6PD induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, which was responsible for the deregulation of autophagy flux. Indeed, G6PD blockade caused a consistent increase of autophagosomes formation independently from mTOR status. Cells engineered to overexpress G6PD became resilient to autophagy and resistant to lapatinib. On the other hand, G6PD inhibition synergistically increased lapatinib-induced cytotoxic effect on cancer cells, while autophagy blockade abolished this effect. Finally, in silico studies showed a significant correlation between G6PD expression and tumour relapse/resistance in patients. These results point out that autophagy and PPP are crucial players in TKI resistance, and highlight a peculiar vulnerability of breast cancer cells, where impairment of metabolic pathways and autophagy could be used to reinforce TKI efficacy in cancer treatment.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Unveiling prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapeutic insights in prostate cancer through multi-omics and machine learning.. Abstract: As a predominant form of cancer affecting male populations, prostate cancer (PCa) demonstrates notably high incidence rates globally. The significant heterogeneity in tumor microenvironment (TME) composition (including epithelial and diverse cell populations) hinders clear interpretation of gene and biomarker roles in disease advancement and immune response modulation. Through combined analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data, this investigation evaluates prostate cancer-related genes' clinical relevance and prognostic potential. We applied approaches like FindAllMarkers, Dseq2 R package, ssGSEA, and WGCNA with both single-cell and bulk transcriptome scales to uncover genes associated with prognosis. Furthermore, we developed a machine learning approach integrating 14 algorithms and 162 algorithmic combinations to support the formation of consensus immune and prognostic-related signatures (IPRS). The IPRS underwent systematic validation in both training and test cohorts, and a multivariate nomogram was constructed to demonstrate its potential utility in prognosis quantification. Through comprehensive multi-omics analyses, which included genomic, single-cell transcriptomic, and bulk transcriptomic data, we sought to achieve a thorough understanding of prognostic characteristics. Furthermore, we evaluated the clinical applicability of the IPRS in the context of immunotherapy and personalized drug selection. Additionally, we examined and confirmed both the gene expression associated with IPRS and the expression level and function of B-cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) within prostate cancer cells and tissue. We discovered 91 genes associated with prognosis in the TME, with 15 of these genes connected to biochemical recurrence. The consensus IPRS constructed based on a machine learning computational framework demonstrates potential value in prognosis prediction and clinical relevance. Multivariate analysis further supports the possibility of IPRS serving as an independent prognostic marker for prostate cancer disease progression. Significant differences in biological functions, immune infiltration, and genomic mutations were also observed among different risk groups. Significantly, the submap method revealed enhanced immunotherapy responsiveness in high-risk patients while highlighting potential pharmacological targets for certain risk subgroups. We selected a collection of genes relevant to PCa prognosis and immune characteristics, which may serve as potential biomarkers with certain clinical translational value.

Abstract: Biomarkers for predicting response to the immunotherapy and chemotherapy combination in breast cancer patients are not established. In this study, we report exploratory genomic and transcriptomic analyses of pretreatment tumor tissues from patients enrolled in phase II clinical trial of a combination of eribulin and nivolumab for HER-2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) (KORNELIA trial, NCT04061863). We analyzed associations between tumor molecular profiles based on genomic (n\u2009=\u200976) and transcriptomic data (n\u2009=\u200958) and therapeutic efficacy. Patients who achieved progression-free survival (PFS)\u2009\u2265\u20096\u00a0months were defined as PFS6-responders and PFS6-nonresponders otherwise. Analyses on tumor mutation burden (TMB) showed a tendency toward a favorable effect on efficacy, while several analyses related to homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) indicated a potentially negative impact on efficacy. Patients harboring TP53 mutations showed significantly poor PFS6 rate and PFS, which correlated with the enrichment of cell cycle-related signatures in PFS6-nonresponders. High antigen presentation gene set enrichment scores (\u2265\u2009median) were significantly associated with longer PFS. Na\u00efve B-cell and plasma cell proportions were considerably higher in long responders (\u2265\u200918\u00a0months). Genomic features including TMB, HRD, and TP53 mutations and transcriptomic features related to immune cell profiles and cell cycle may distinguish responders. Our findings provide insights for further exploring the combination regimen and its biomarkers in these tumors. Journal: Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Recent advances are enabling delivery of precision genomic medicine to cancer clinics. While the majority of approaches profile panels of selected genes or hotspot regions, comprehensive data provided by whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing and analysis (WGTA) present an opportunity to align a much larger proportion of patients to therapies. Samples from 570 patients with advanced or metastatic cancer of diverse types enrolled in the Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) program underwent WGTA. DNA-based data, including mutations, copy number and mutation signatures, were combined with RNA-based data, including gene expression and fusions, to generate comprehensive WGTA profiles. A multidisciplinary molecular tumour board used WGTA profiles to identify and prioritize clinically actionable alterations and inform therapy. Patient responses to WGTA-informed therapies were collected. Clinically actionable targets were identified for 83% of patients, of which 37% of patients received WGTA-informed treatments. RNA expression data were particularly informative, contributing to 67% of WGTA-informed treatments; 25% of treatments were informed by RNA expression alone. Of a total 248 WGTA-informed treatments, 46% resulted in clinical benefit. RNA expression data were comparable to DNA-based mutation and copy number data in aligning to clinically beneficial treatments. Genome signatures also guided therapeutics including platinum, poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors and immunotherapies. Patients accessed WGTA-informed treatments through clinical trials (19%), off-label use (35%) and as standard therapies (46%) including those which would not otherwise have been the next choice of therapy, demonstrating the utility of genomic information to direct use of chemotherapies as well as targeted therapies. Integrating RNA expression and genome data illuminated treatment options that resulted in 46% of treated patients experiencing positive clinical benefit, supporting the use of comprehensive WGTA profiling in clinical cancer care.

Abstract: Occurrence at a young age is known to be associated with unique clinical features in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the genomic differences between young and old patients with CRC are not well elucidated and, to the best of our knowledge, have never been investigated in a Chinese population. Tumor tissue samples from 29 young (age \u226450\u00a0years) and 46 old (age >50\u00a0years) patients with CRC were collected. Targeted sequencing of 808 cancer-related genes was conducted to characterize the genomic landscape for Chinese CRC. Overall, mutational profiles exhibited notable differences between the two groups. In particular, APC and PIK3CA mutations were more frequently observed in old patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.012, respectively), while SMAD4 mutations tended to occur in young patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.054). Mutation loci distributions of KRAS in the young cohort differed from those in the old cohort, and a higher frequency of KRAS codon 12 mutations was potentially associated with a young age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.076). The frequencies of clinically actionable alterations were analyzed by defined age categories, which unveiled a distinctive targeted genomic profile in the young group. Furthermore, among patients with mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) CRC, tumor mutation burden (TMB) was positively correlated with age (Pearson's r\u00a0=\u00a00.306, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), and genomic alterations associated with high TMB in young patients differentiated from those in old patients. These findings revealed different molecular characterization between young and old Chinese patients with CRC, which may provide novel insights for the personalized treatment of CRC.

Abstract: Precision oncology has transformed the treatment landscape for patients with advanced solid tumors. Tumor-agnostic therapies, those that have been approved based on genetic mutations or biomarkers across tumor histology types, are important examples of how the implementation of precision oncology can expand therapeutic options for patients, especially those with rare cancer types and treatment-refractory disease. In this review, we first discuss how advances in next-generation sequencing and molecular profiling have enabled the identification of shared actionable alterations. Subsequently, we explore the current landscape of tumor-agnostic therapies that have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration. We discuss the strengths and limitations of these therapies and evaluate the clinical trial data leading to their approval. In addition, we detail updated results from these clinical trials and additional observational studies reported after the approval. Several factors such as tumor histology, specific alteration types, and the presence of co-alterations are associated with the efficacy of these therapies. Also, challenges remain in understanding resistance mechanisms and predicting response. Looking ahead, we discuss how improved diagnostic tools, novel experimental strategies, and innovative trial designs may further advance the field of precision oncology and improve therapeutic options for patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Genetic background and evolution of relapses in aggressive B-cell lymphomas.. Abstract: Relapses of aggressive B-cell lymphomas pose a higher risk to affected patients because of potential treatment resistance and usually rapid tumor growth. Recent advances, such as targeting Bruton tyrosine kinase, have provided promising results in small numbers of cases, but treatment for the majority of patients remains challenging and outcomes are generally poor. A number of recent studies have utilized state-of-the-art genomic technologies in an attempt to better understand tumor genome evolution during relapse and to identify relapse-specific genetic alterations. It has been found that in some settings (e.g. diffuse large B-cell lymphomas in immunocompromised patients, secondary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas as Richter transformations) a significant part of the recurrences are <i>clonally-unrelated de novo</i> neoplasms, which might have distinct genomic and drug sensitivity profiles as well as different prognoses. Similar to earlier findings in indolent lymphomas, genetic tumor evolution of <i>clonally-related</i> relapsing aggressive B-cell lymphomas is predominantly characterized by two patterns: early divergence from a common progenitor and late divergence/linear evolution from a primary tumor. The clinical implications of these distinct patterns are not yet clear and will require additional investigation; however, it is plausible that these two patterns of recurrence are linked to different treatment-resistance mechanisms. Attempts to identify drivers of relapses result in a very heterogeneous list of affected genes and pathways as well as epigenetic mechanisms and suggest many ways of how recurrent tumors can adapt to treatment and expand their malignant properties.

Abstract: Relapse after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a major cause of death in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Here, we retrospectively analysed the contributions of lineage-sorted donor cell chimerism (sDCC) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting disease-specific genetic rearrangements to detect minimal residual/relapsing disease (MRD) and predict impending relapse in 94 adult ALL patients after SCT. With a median follow-up of surviving patients (n\u2009=\u200961) of 3.3 years, qPCR and/or sDCC measurements turned positive in 38 patients (40%). Of these, 22 patients relapsed and 16 remained in complete remission. At 3 years, qPCR and/or sDCC positive patients showed an increased incidence of relapse (50% vs. 4%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), decreased relapse-free survival (RFS, 40% vs. 85%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and decreased overall survival (OS, 47% vs. 87%, p 0.004). Both, qPCR and sDCC pre-detected 11 of 21 relapses occurring within the first two years after SCT and, overall, complemented for each other method in four of the relapsing and four of the non-relapsing cases. Patients receiving pre-emptive MRD-driven interventions (n\u2009=\u200911) or not (n\u2009=\u200910) showed comparable median times until relapse, RFS, and OS. In our single centre cohort, qPCR and sDCC were similarly effective and complementary helpful to indicate haematological relapse of ALL after SCT. Journal: Bone marrow transplantation. Year: 2020.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Long-term relapses of breast cancer: questions, interpretations and hypotheses.. Abstract: The author has demonstrated in previous publications that the consistent characteristic of long-term relapses of carcinoma after more than 8 years from surgery is hormone dependence, since long-term relapses occur almost exclusively in hormone-dependent tumors such as carcinoma of the breast, prostate, endometrium and thyroid. Such publications presented a series of 237 long term relapses of breast cancer that occurred at no less than 8 years from the mastectomy, which proved that all the patients were estrogen-receptor positive. Estrogen-negative cases who did not relapse after 8 years from surgery should be considered cured, as is found for cases of non-hormone-dependent tumors. Therefore, the study demonstrates that breast cancer, without the presence of hormone receptors (which influence clinical behavior) is similar to neoplasms that arise in all parts of the body. The author herein presents a personal hypothesis relative to the possibility that the presence of receptors indirectly conditions the formation of antimitotic factors up to determining in some cases the phenomenon of long-term relapses. Such factors are presumably physiological, and the possibility that such a hypothesis can also serve to explain the results obtained with hormone therapy of breast cancer is examined.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The Role of EREG/EGFR Pathway in Tumor Progression.. Abstract: Aberrant activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1) by erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ERBB) ligands contributes to various tumor malignancies, including lung cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC). Epiregulin (EREG) is one of the EGFR ligands and is low expressed in most normal tissues. Elevated EREG in various cancers mainly activates EGFR signaling pathways and promotes cancer progression. Notably, a higher EREG expression level in CRC with wild-type Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) is related to better efficacy of therapeutic treatment. By contrast, the resistance of anti-EGFR therapy in CRC was driven by low EREG expression, aberrant genetic mutation and signal pathway alterations. Additionally, EREG overexpression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is anticipated to be a therapeutic target for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). However, recent findings indicate that EREG derived from macrophages promotes NSCLC cell resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment. The emerging events of EREG-mediated tumor promotion signals are generated by autocrine and paracrine loops that arise from tumor epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is a crucial element for the development of various cancer types and drug resistance. The regulation of EREG/EGFR pathways depends on distinct oncogenic driver mutations and cell contexts that allows specific pharmacological targeting alone or combinational treatment for tailored therapy. Novel strategies targeting EREG/EGFR, tumor-associated macrophages, and alternative activation oncoproteins are under development or undergoing clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the clinical outcomes of EREG expression and the interaction of this ligand in the TME. The EREG/EGFR pathway may be a potential target and may be combined with other driver mutation targets to combat specific cancers. Journal: International journal of molecular sciences. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) refers to the presence of distinct tumor cell populations. It provides vital information for the clinical prognosis, drug responsiveness, and personalized treatment of cancer patients. As genomic ITH in various cancers affects the expression patterns of genes, the expression profile could be utilized for determining ITH level. Herein, we present a novel approach to directly detect high ITH defined as a larger number of subclones from the gene expression pattern through machine learning approaches. We examined associations between gene expression profile and ITH of 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Using stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) showing high association, we evaluated the performance of our method in predicting ITH by employing three machine learning algorithms using gene expression profile data. We classified tumors into high and low heterogeneity groups using the learning model through the selection of LASSO feature. The result showed that support vector machines (SVMs) outperformed other algorithms (AUC = 0.84 in SVMs and 0.82 in Na\u00efve Bayes) and we were able to improve predictive power by using both combined data from mutation and expression. Furthermore, we evaluated the prediction ability of each model using simulation data generated by mixing cell lines of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and obtained consistent results with using real dataset. Our approach could be utilized for discriminating tumors with heterogeneous cell populations to characterize ITH. Journal: PloS one. Year: 2019. Authors: Sung JY, Shin HT, Sohn KA, Shin SY, Park WY.

Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: Targeted therapies in cancer aim to inhibit specific molecular targets responsible for enhanced tumor growth. AKT/PKB (protein kinase B) is a serine threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular pathways, including survival, proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Although phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) is the key regulator of AKT activation, numerous stimuli and kinases initiate pro-proliferative AKT signaling which results in the activation of AKT pathway to drive cellular growth and survival. Activating mutations and amplification of components of the AKT pathway are implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancers including breast and ovarian. Given its importance, AKT, it has been validated as a promising therapeutic target.<b>Areas covered</b>: This article summarizes AKT's biological function and different classes of AKT inhibitors as anticancer agents. We also explore the efficacy of AKT inhibitors as monotherapies and in combination with cytotoxic and other targeted therapies.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The complex mechanism following AKT inhibition requires the addition of other therapies to prevent resistance and improve clinical response. Further studies are necessary to determine additional rational combinations that can enhance efficacy of AKT inhibitors, potentially by targeting compensatory mechanisms, and/or enhancing apoptosis. The identification of biomarkers of response is essential for the development of successful therapeutics. Journal: Expert opinion on investigational drugs. Year: 2019.

In this study, we surveyed the genomic features in Chinese UC patients and investigated the concordance of genetic alterations between circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma and matched tumor tissue. A total of 112 UC patients were enrolled, of which 31 were upper tract UC (UTUC) and 81 were UC of bladder (UCB). Genomic alterations in 92 selected genes were analyzed by targeted next-generation sequencing. In the study cohort, 94.64, 86.61 and 62.50% of patients were identified as having valid somatic, oncogenic and actionable somatic alterations, respectively. The most frequently altered genes included TP53, KMT2D, KDM6A, FAT4, FAT1, CREBBP and ARID1A. The higher prevalence of HRAS (22.0% vs 3.7%) and KMT2D (59.26% vs 34.57%) was identified in UTUC than in UCB. Comparisons of somatic alterations of UCB and UTUC between the study cohort and western cohorts revealed significant differences in mutant prevalence. Notably, 28.57, 17.86 and 47.32% of the cases harbored alterations in FGFRs, ERBBs and DNA damage repair genes, respectively. Furthermore, 75% of the patients carried non-benign germline variants, but only two (1.79%) were pathogenic. The overall concordance for genomic alterations in ctDNA and matched tumor tissue was 42.97% (0-100%). Notably, 47.25% of alterations detected in ctDNA were not detected in the matched tissue, and 54.14% of which were oncogenic mutations. We found a unique genomic feature of Chinese UC patients. A reasonably good concordance of genomic features between ctDNA and tissue samples were identified. Journal: BMC cancer. Year: 2021. Authors: Yang B, Zhao X, Wan C, Ma X, Niu S.

Abstract: Identifying and understanding the biological events that occur following ultraviolet (UV) exposure are mandatory to elucidate the biological and clinical consequences of sun exposure, and to provide efficient and adequate photoprotection strategies. The main UVinduced biological features (markers related to sunburn, cancer, photoaging immunosuppression, pigmentation), characterized in human skin in vivo, could be reproduced in adapted models of reconstructed skin in vitro, attesting their high relevance in the field of photobiology. In turn, 3D skin models were useful to discover precise biological pathways involved in UV response and were predictive of in vivo situation. Although they did not follow a strict validation process for the determination of protection factors, they enabled to evidence important concepts in photoprotection. Indeed, the use of reconstructed skin model highlighted the importance of broad spectrum sunscreen use to protect essential cellular functions, and biologically proved that SPF value was not predictive of the level of protection in the UVA wavelength domain. New biological approaches, such as transcriptomic or proteomic studies as well as quantitative and qualitative determination of DNA damage, will indisputably increase the added value of such systems for sunscreen efficiency evaluation.

Abstract: Testicular relapse (TR) in adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is uncommon, occurring in only 1-2% of patients with bone marrow relapse. TR in the absence of systemic relapse has been reported previously in 2 adults and 12 children, of which 67% were monocytic variants of AML. This article presents the case of a 29-year-old man with AML that relapsed in his testicle without evidence of bone marrow relapse. This patient and the two previously mentioned adults experienced bone marrow relapse within 2 months and died within 7 months of their TR. TR in adult myelogenous leukemia should be considered a harbinger of systemic relapse and suggests a need for aggressive local and systemic therapy. Journal: Cancer. Year: 1992.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Reprogramming of mitochondrial proline metabolism promotes liver tumorigenesis.. Abstract: Dysregulated cellular energetics has recently been recognized as a hallmark of cancer and garnered attention as a potential targeting strategy for cancer therapeutics. Cancer cells reprogram metabolic activities to meet bio-energetic, biosynthetic and redox requirements needed to sustain indefinite proliferation. In many cases, metabolic reprogramming is the result of complex interactions between genetic alterations in well-known oncogenes and tumor suppressors and epigenetic changes. While the metabolism of the two most abundant nutrients, glucose and glutamine, is reprogrammed in a wide range of cancers, accumulating evidence demonstrates that additional metabolic pathways are also critical for cell survival and growth. Proline metabolism is one such metabolic pathway that promotes tumorigenesis in multiple cancer types, including liver cancer, which is the fourth main cause of cancer mortality in the world. Despite the recent spate of approved treatments, including targeted therapy and combined immunotherapies, there has been no significant gain in clinical benefits in the majority of liver cancer patients. Thus, exploring novel therapeutic strategies and identifying new molecular targets remains a top priority for liver cancer. Two of the enzymes in the proline biosynthetic pathway, pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PYCR1) and Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 18 Family Member A1 (ALDH18A1), are upregulated in liver cancer of both human and animal models, while proline catabolic enzymes, such as proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) are downregulated. Here we review the latest evidence linking proline metabolism to liver and other cancers and potential mechanisms of action for the proline pathway in cancer development. Journal: Amino acids.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cross-regulation between microRNAs and key proteins of signaling pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma.. Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a subtype of primary liver cancer and a major cause of death. Although miRNA plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma, the specific regulatory network remains unclear. Therefore, this paper comprehensively describes the miRNA-related signaling pathways in HCC and the possible interactions among different signaling pathways. The aim is to lay the foundation for the discovery of new molecular targets and multi-target therapy. Based on miRNA, HCC, and signaling pathways, the literature was searched on Web of Science and PubMed. Then, common targets between different signaling pathways were found from KEGG database, and possible cross-regulation mechanisms were further studied. In this review, we elaborated from two aspects, respectively, laying a foundation for studying the regulatory mechanism and potential targets of miRNA in HCC. Non-coding RNAs have become notable molecules in cancer research in recent years, and many types of targeted drugs have emerged. From the outset, molecular targets and signal pathways are interlinked, which suggests that signal pathways and regulatory networks should be concerned in basic research, which also provides a strong direction for future mechanism research.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Factors associated with recurrence and survival length following relapse in patients with neuroblastoma.. Abstract: Despite therapeutic advances, survival following relapse for neuroblastoma patients remains poor. We investigated clinical and biological factors associated with length of progression-free and overall survival following relapse in UK neuroblastoma patients. All cases of relapsed neuroblastoma, diagnosed during 1990-2010, were identified from four Paediatric Oncology principal treatment centres. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to calculate post-relapse overall survival (PROS), post-relapse progression-free survival (PRPFS) between relapse and further progression, and to investigate influencing factors. One hundred eighty-nine cases were identified from case notes, 159 (84.0%) high risk and 17 (9.0%), unresectable, MYCN non-amplified (non-MNA) intermediate risk (IR). For high-risk patients diagnosed >2000, median PROS was 8.4 months (interquartile range (IQR)=3.0-17.4) and median PRPFS was 4.7 months (IQR=2.1-7.1). For IR, unresectable non-MNA patients, median PROS was 11.8 months (IQR 9.0-51.6) and 5-year PROS was 24% (95% CI 7-45%). MYCN amplified (MNA) disease and bone marrow metastases at diagnosis were independently associated with worse PROS for high-risk cases. Eighty percent of high-risk relapses occurred within 2 years of diagnosis compared with 50% of unresectable non-MNA IR disease. Patients with relapsed HR neuroblastomas should be treatment stratified according to MYCN status and PRPFS should be the primary endpoint in early phase clinical trials. The failure to salvage the majority of IR neuroblastoma is concerning, supporting investigation of intensification of upfront treatment regimens in this group to determine whether their use would diminish likelihood of relapse.

Abstract: Epigenetic mechanisms work in an orchestrated fashion to control gene expression in both homeostasis and diseases. Among small noncoding RNAs, piRNAs seem to meet the necessary requirements to be included in this epigenetic network due to their role in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. piRNAs and PIWI proteins might play important roles in cancer occurrence, prognosis and treatment as reported previously. Nevertheless, the potential clinical relevance of these molecules has yet been elucidated. A brief overview of piRNA biogenesis and their potential roles as part of an epigenetic network that is possibly involved in cancer is provided. Moreover, potential strategies based on the use of piRNAs and PIWI proteins as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as for cancer therapeutics are discussed. Journal: Epigenomics. Year: 2015.

Abstract: Mutations in the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-targeted ligand binding domain of PML-RAR\u03b1 (PR\u03b1/LBD+) have been implicated in the passive selection of ATRA-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia clones leading to disease relapse. Among 45 relapse patients from the ATRA/chemotherapy arm of intergroup protocol C9710, 18 patients harbored PR\u03b1/LBD+ (40%), 7 of whom (39%) relapsed Off-ATRA selection pressure, suggesting a possible active role of PR\u03b1/LBD+. Of 41 relapse patients coanalyzed, 15 (37%) had FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication mutations (FLT3-ITD+), which were differentially associated with PR\u03b1/LBD+ depending on ATRA treatment status at relapse: positively, On-ATRA; negatively, Off-ATRA. Thirteen of 21 patients (62%) had additional chromosome abnormalities (ACAs); all coanalyzed PR\u03b1/LBD mutant patients who relapsed off-ATRA (n = 5) had associated ACA. After relapse Off-ATRA, ACA and FLT3-ITD+ were negatively associated and were oppositely associated with presenting white blood count and PML-RAR\u03b1 type: ACA, low, L-isoform; FLT3-ITD+, high, S-isoform. These exploratory results suggest that differing PR\u03b1/LBD+ activities may interact with FLT3-ITD+ or ACA, that FLT3-ITD+ and ACA are associated with different intrinsic disease progression pathways manifest at relapse Off-ATRA, and that these different pathways may be short-circuited by ATRA-selectable defects at relapse On-ATRA. ACA and certain PR\u03b1/LBD+ were also associated with reduced postrelapse survival. Journal: Blood. Year: 2012. Authors: Gallagher RE, Moser BK, Racevskis J, Poir\u00e9 X, Bloomfield CD.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Prediction of drug-target interaction by integrating diverse heterogeneous information source with multiple kernel learning and clustering methods.. Abstract: Identification of potential drug-target interaction pairs is very important for pharmaceutical innovation and drug discovery. Numerous machine learning-based and network-based algorithms have been developed for predicting drug-target interactions. However, large-scale pharmacological, genomic and chemical datum emerged recently provide new opportunity for further heightening the accuracy of drug-target interactions prediction. In this work, based on the assumption that similar drugs tend to interact with similar proteins and vice versa, we developed a novel computational method (namely MKLC-BiRW) to predict new drug-target interactions. MKLC-BiRW integrates diverse drug-related and target-related heterogeneous information source by using the multiple kernel learning and clustering methods to generate the drug and target similarity matrices, in which the low similarity elements are set to zero to build the drug and target similarity correction networks. By incorporating these drug and target similarity correction networks with known drug-target interaction bipartite graph, MKLC-BiRW constructs the heterogeneous network on which Bi-random walk algorithm is adopted to infer the potential drug-target interactions. Compared with other existing state-of-the-art methods, MKLC-BiRW achieves the best performance in terms of AUC and AUPR. MKLC-BiRW can effectively predict the potential drug-target interactions.

Abstract: An overview of therapeutic oncology biosimilars, the U.S. biosimilars regulatory pathway, and the clinical development of selected biosimilar products is provided, including discussion of considerations in adopting biosimilars into oncology practice. Biosimilars are biologic agents that are highly similar to and have no clinically meaningful differences from an approved reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. There is a large market for cancer biologics, and approval of biosimilars has the potential to increase access to care and reduce costs. An abbreviated regulatory pathway for the development and approval of biosimilars defines a stepwise approach to demonstrating biosimilarity and conducting clinical comparative trials to confirm equivalent pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity to the reference product. Three therapeutic biologics (bevacizumab, trastuzumab, and rituximab) have been used extensively in the treatment of a variety of cancers and are targets for biosimilar product development. Preclinical and clinical experience with 2 recently approved biosimilars to bevacizumab and trastuzumab is reviewed. Challenges faced by pharmacy and therapeutics committees when considering oncology biosimilars for formulary inclusion are discussed. Increased adoption of biosimilars could potentially lower treatment costs and improve access to biologics for patients with cancer. Key considerations in formulary review of biosimilars include the quality and quantity of data from comparative clinical trials, economic factors, manufacturer reliability, and challenges associated with incorporating biosimilars into practice.

Abstract: MicroRNAs(miRNAs)are small(18-25 nucleotides)noncoding RNA molecules that bind to partially complementary mRNA sequences, resulting in target degradation or translation inhibition. A single miRNA can influence the expression of hundreds of target genes, and miRNAs have been implicated as key molecules in various diseases, including cancer. Many studies have shown that the miRNAs play an important role in cancer cells and tumor microenvironment and may be biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targets for various cancers. Recently, relationships between miRNAs and immunocheckpoint molecules have been focused on as new tumor progression associated mechanisms. As for biomarkers, cell-free miRNAs detected in body fluids(circulating miRNAs)have attached the attention of researchers due to their potential as tumor-specific and non-invasive biomarkers. In terms of strategies to use miRNAs as therapeutic targets, developments of tissue specific delivery systems, including lipid nanoparticles or exosome vectors, are progressing. Here we will review the mechanisms and clinical uses of miRNAs in cancer. Journal: Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy. Year: 2017. Authors: Nambara S, Mimori K.

Abstract: Over the last 20 years, complete cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) dramatically increased the survival of patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases (CRPM). However, despite better knowledge of the disease, around 70% of patients relapse after CRS with HIPEC. This study was designed to analyse the pattern of recurrence and the outcomes of different treatment modalities. Patients relapsing after CRS plus HIPEC for CRPM were selected from a prospective database. The impact of iterative curative-intent treatments was analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariate Cox regression models. Between April 1993 and December 2014, 190 of 274 (69%) patients previously treated by CRS plus HIPEC developed relapse, as an isolated peritoneal recurrence (31%), isolated distant recurrence (35%), or multisite recurrence (34%). The curative-intent treatment rate was 48% for isolated peritoneal recurrences, 49% for isolated distant recurrences and 22% for multisite recurrences (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). From the diagnosis of relapse, 3- and 5-year overall survival were 77% and 46% after curative-intent treatment and 14% and 4.7% after non-curative treatment, with median survival of 59.7 and 18.3 months (log-rank p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), respectively. Regression analysis identified the initial extent of CRPM (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.25; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), iterative curative-intent treatment (HR: 0.22; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001)\u00a0and disease-free interval (HR: 1.77; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) as independent predictors of prolonged survival. Iterative curative-intent treatment can be performed in up to 40% of patients with relapse after CRS and HIPEC for CRPM, and is associated with prolonged survival in selected patients.

Abstract: Cancer has become one of the leading causes of increased mortality. The currently employed diagnostic and therapeutic modality offers only minimal specificity towards cancerous cells and affects normal healthy cells. Targeted drug delivery systems have shown an improved efficiency in the diagnosis and treatment of various cancers, as the targeted molecules specifically reach the tumor cells without exerting any undesirable effects on the normal healthy cells. Recent findings have shown that disruption of blood vasculature and lymphatics is efficient in treating various cancers. As these vessels supply nutrient and oxygen, remove wastes and help in the metastasis; therapeutic agents targeting them will be highly useful. Of the various ligands used for targeting blood vasculature and lymphatics, peptides possess great advantage over other molecules. This review article is aimed at focusing the recent findings and developments on the peptides as targeting ligands for the improved anti-angiogenesis therapy. Journal: Current cancer drug targets.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrated genomic analysis identifies clinically relevant subtypes of renal clear cell carcinoma.. Abstract: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) account for over 80% of renal malignancies. The most common type of RCC can be classified into three subtypes including clear cell, papillary and chromophobe. ccRCC (the Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma) is the most frequent form and shows variations in genetics and behavior. To improve accuracy and personalized care and increase the cure rate of cancer, molecular typing for individuals is necessary. We adopted the genome, transcriptome and methylation HMK450 data of ccRCC in The Cancer Genome Atlas Network in this research. Consensus Clustering algorithm was used to cluster the expression data and three subtypes were found. To further validate our results, we analyzed an independent data set and arrived at a consistent conclusion. Next, we characterized the subtype by unifying genomic and clinical dimensions of ccRCC molecular stratification. We also implemented GSEA between the malignant subtype and the other subtypes to explore latent pathway varieties and WGCNA to discover intratumoral gene interaction network. Moreover, the epigenetic state changes between subgroups on methylation data are discovered and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to delve the relation between specific genes and prognosis. We found a subtype of poor prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, which is abnormally upregulated in focal adhesions and cytoskeleton related pathways, and the expression of core genes in the pathways are negatively correlated with patient outcomes. Our work of classification schema could provide an applicable framework of molecular typing to ccRCC patients which has implications to influence treatment decisions, judge biological mechanisms involved in ccRCC tumor progression, and potential future drug discovery.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cancer Stem Cells-Origins and Biomarkers: Perspectives for Targeted Personalized Therapies.. Abstract: The use of biomarkers in diagnosis, therapy and prognosis has gained increasing interest over the last decades. In particular, the analysis of biomarkers in cancer patients within the pre- and post-therapeutic period is required to identify several types of cells, which carry a risk for a disease progression and subsequent post-therapeutic relapse. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells that can drive tumor initiation and can cause relapses. At the time point of tumor initiation, CSCs originate from either differentiated cells or adult tissue resident stem cells. Due to their importance, several biomarkers that characterize CSCs have been identified and correlated to diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. However, CSCs have been shown to display a high plasticity, which changes their phenotypic and functional appearance. Such changes are induced by chemo- and radiotherapeutics as well as senescent tumor cells, which cause alterations in the tumor microenvironment. Induction of senescence causes tumor shrinkage by modulating an anti-tumorigenic environment in which tumor cells undergo growth arrest and immune cells are attracted. Besides these positive effects after therapy, senescence can also have negative effects displayed post-therapeutically. These unfavorable effects can directly promote cancer stemness by increasing CSC plasticity phenotypes, by activating stemness pathways in non-CSCs, as well as by promoting senescence escape and subsequent activation of stemness pathways. At the end, all these effects can lead to tumor relapse and metastasis. This review provides an overview of the most frequently used CSC markers and their implementation as biomarkers by focussing on deadliest solid (lung, stomach, liver, breast and colorectal cancers) and hematological (acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia) cancers. Furthermore, it gives examples on how the CSC markers might be influenced by therapeutics, such as chemo- and radiotherapy, and the tumor microenvironment. It points out, that it is crucial to identify and monitor residual CSCs, senescent tumor cells, and the pro-tumorigenic senescence-associated secretory phenotype in a therapy follow-up using specific biomarkers. As a future perspective, a targeted immune-mediated strategy using chimeric antigen receptor based approaches for the removal of remaining chemotherapy-resistant cells as well as CSCs in a personalized therapeutic approach are discussed.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Mutational landscape of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia at diagnosis and relapse.. Abstract: Despite the high probability of cure of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), mechanisms of relapse are still largely unclear. Mutational profiling at diagnosis and/or relapse may help to identify APL patients needing frequent molecular monitoring and early treatment intervention. Using an NGS approach including a 31 myeloid gene-panel, we tested BM samples of 44 APLs at the time of diagnosis, and of 31 at relapse. Mutations in PML and RARA genes were studied using a customized-NGS-RNA panel. Patients relapsing after ATRA-chemotherapy rarely had additional mutations (P =\u2009.009). In patients relapsing after ATRA/ATO, the PML gene was a preferential mutation target. We then evaluated the predictive value of mutations at APL diagnosis. A median of two mutations was detectable in 9/11 patients who later relapsed, vs one mutation in 21/33 patients who remained in CCR (P =\u2009.0032). This corresponded to a significantly lower risk of relapse in patients with one or less mutations (HR 0.046; 95% CI 0.011-0.197; P <\u2009.0001). NGS-analysis at the time of APL diagnosis may inform treatment decisions, including alternative treatments for cases with an unfavorable mutation profile. Journal: American journal of hematology.

Mutations of the kinase itself or the pathway regulated by kinases leads to the progression of diseases such as Alzheimer's, viral infections, and cancers. Cancer chemotherapy has made significant leaps in recent years. The utilization of chemotherapeutic agents for treating cancers has become difficult due to their unpredictable nature and their toxicity toward the host cells. Therefore, targeted therapy as a therapeutic option against cancer-specific cells and toward the signaling pathways is a valuable avenue of research. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus that is responsible for causing the COVID pandemic. Kinase family provides a valuable source of biological targets against cancers and for recent COVID infections. Kinases such as tyrosine kinases, Rho kinase, Bruton tyrosine kinase, ABL kinases, and NAK kinases play an important role in the modulation of signaling pathways involved in both cancers and viral infections such as COVID. These kinase inhibitors consist of multiple protein targets such as the viral replication machinery and specific molecules targeting signaling pathways for cancer. Thus, kinase inhibitors can be used for their anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic activity along with cytokine suppression in cases of COVID. The main goal of this review is to focus on the pharmacology of kinase inhibitors for cancer and COVID, as well as ideas for future development. Journal: Archives of microbiology. Year: 2023.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a standard treatment for breast cancer (BC) to shrink tumors and facilitate surgery. However, the molecular underpinnings of response to NAC and prognosis have not been well characterized. We enrolled 73 stage II/III BC patients who received NAC followed by surgery. Tumor tissue samples were available from 36 patients at baseline and 38 at the time of surgery. Plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was collected at three time points: before NAC (n\u2009=\u200963), during NAC (n\u2009=\u200942), and after NAC (n\u2009=\u200940). Comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic, and ctDNA analyses were performed to identify biomarkers associated with pathological complete response (pCR) and survival outcomes. Nine baseline mutations, including DNHD1 and PLEC, along with HIPPO pathway alterations, were associated with pCR. Responsive tumors exhibited immune activation and downregulated PI3K-Akt and AGE-RAGE pathways, while non-pCR tumors showed reduced cytokine and immune receptor activity. Undetectable ctDNA during and after NAC was predictive of treatment efficacy and correlated with improved survival. Baseline mutations in USH2A were associated with shorter disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 11.9; 95% confidence interval: 2.8-50.8; P\u2009<\u20090.001), with a consistent trend observed for overall survival. Elevated NHSL1 expression in baseline tumors indicated an initial treatment response but was later associated with tumor relapse and poor overall survival (P\u2009=\u20090.026 and P\u2009=\u20090.023, respectively), findings that were validated in an independent clinical cohort (N\u2009=\u200930) through immunohistochemistry staining. Our comprehensive multi-omics analysis identified promising biomarkers predictive of treatment response and survival in BC patients receiving NAC followed by surgery. These findings underscore the importance of early tumor assessment for improved patient stratification and prognostication. Journal: Breast cancer research : BCR. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of molecularly targeted drugs in cancer for target pathway evaluation.. Abstract: Targeted therapy is a rational and promising strategy for the treatment of advanced cancer. For the development of clinical agents targeting oncogenic signaling pathways, it is important to define the specificity of compounds to the target molecular pathway. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis is an unbiased approach to evaluate the compound mode of action, but it is still unknown whether the analysis could be widely applicable to classify molecularly targeted anticancer agents. We comprehensively obtained and analyzed 129 transcriptomic datasets of cancer cells treated with 83 anticancer drugs or related agents, covering most clinically used, molecularly targeted drugs alongside promising inhibitors of molecular cancer targets. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis revealed that compounds targeting similar target molecules or pathways were clustered together. These results confirmed that the gene signatures of these drugs reflected their modes of action. Of note, inhibitors of oncogenic kinase pathways formed a large unique cluster, showing that these agents affect a shared molecular pathway distinct from classical antitumor agents and other classes of agents. The gene signature analysis further classified kinome-targeting agents depending on their target signaling pathways, and we identified target pathway-selective signature gene sets. The gene expression analysis was also valuable in uncovering unexpected target pathways of some anticancer agents. These results indicate that comprehensive transcriptomic analysis with our database (http://scads.jfcr.or.jp/db/cs/) is a powerful strategy to validate and re-evaluate the target pathways of anticancer compounds.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrating antibody drug conjugates in the management of gynecologic cancers.. Abstract: The clinical development of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) in ovarian cancer began in 2008 with farletuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, and vintafolide, an antigen drug conjugate, both targeting alpha folate receptor. Over the years, this novel class of drugs expanded to agents with a more sophisticated design and structure, targeting tissue factor (TF) in cervical cancer or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in endometrial cancer. Despite the impressive number of patients included in clinical trials investigating different ADCs across gynecological cancers, it was only recently that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approvals to the first ADCs in gynecologic cancer. In September 2021, the FDA approved tisotumab vedotin (TV) in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy. This was followed in November 2022, by the approval of mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV) for adult patients with folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1) positive, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received one to three prior systemic treatment regimens. Currently, the field of ADCs is rapidly expanding and more than 20 ADC formulations are in clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian, cervical and endometrial tumors. This review summarizes key evidence supporting their use and therapeutic indications, including results from late-stage development trials investigating MIRV in ovarian cancer and TV in cervical cancer. We also outline new concepts in the field of ADCs, including promising targets such as NaPi2 and novel drug delivery platforms such as dolaflexin with a scaffold-linker. Finally, we briefly present challenges in the clinical management of ADC toxicities and the emerging role of ADC combination therapies, including chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic and immunotherapeutic agents.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrative genomic analysis of mouse and human hepatocellular carcinoma.. Abstract: Cancer genomics has enabled the exhaustive molecular characterization of tumors and exposed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as among the most complex cancers. This complexity is paralleled by dozens of mouse models that generate histologically similar tumors but have not been systematically validated at the molecular level. Accurate models of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC are essential for biomedical progress; therefore we compared genomic and transcriptomic profiles of four separate mouse models [MUP transgenic, TAK1-knockout, carcinogen-driven diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and Stelic Animal Model (STAM)] with those of 987 HCC patients with distinct etiologies. These four models differed substantially in their mutational load, mutational signatures, affected genes and pathways, and transcriptomes. STAM tumors were most molecularly similar to human HCC, with frequent mutations in <i>Ctnnb1</i>, similar pathway alterations, and high transcriptomic similarity to high-grade, proliferative human tumors with poor prognosis. In contrast, TAK1 tumors better reflected the mutational signature of human HCC and were transcriptionally similar to low-grade human tumors. DEN tumors were least similar to human disease and almost universally carried the <i>Braf</i> V637E mutation, which is rarely found in human HCC. Immune analysis revealed that strain-specific MHC-I genotype can influence the molecular makeup of murine tumors. Thus, different mouse models of HCC recapitulate distinct aspects of HCC biology, and their use should be adapted to specific questions based on the molecular features provided here.

Abstract: The micropapillary (MIP) pattern is a high-grade histological subtype of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with poor prognosis. In this study, surgically resected tumor samples from 101 patients with stage I-III MIP-LUAD (MIP \u226530%) were microdissected to separate MIP components from non-MIP components, all of which underwent RNA and DNA whole-exome sequencing (WES). The genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of MIP and non-MIP components within MIP-enriched tumor tissues demonstrated remarkable similarities, notably marked by high epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alteration frequencies. However, when compared to MIP-na\u00efve LUAD tissues, MIP components showed higher chromosomal instability and revealed 18 enriched alterations, encompassing EGFR mutations, EGFR amplifications, and CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletions, which all linked to upregulation of cell proliferation pathways and downregulation of immune pathways. Shared mutations were observed in 97.8% (91/93) of patients with paired DNA WES data for MIP and non-MIP components within the same tissues, suggesting a common origin. The recurrence-free survival analysis identified MACF1, PCLO, ADGRV1, and Fanconi Anemia pathway mutations as negative indicators. In all, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the molecular characteristics and transformation mechanisms of MIP-LUAD, employing microdissection techniques to investigate the genomic and transcriptomic levels within a substantial cohort, providing insights for precision medicine of this aggressive cancer subtype. \u00a9 2025 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer prognosis has remained poor and no significant improvement has been achieved over the past two decades. A number of genetic alterations are found in pancreatic cancer with a complex genome and proteome that needs further research investigation and discovery. There is an urgent need for innovative research findings that would increase the 5-year survival rate in patients with pancreatic ductal carcinoma, which in fact has seen only small increments over the past two decades. Targeting the tumor and modifying the stroma could help improve therapy responses. Genomic medicine is useful in a fraction of patients currently; however, the newer proteomic approaches are potentially more likely to help the majority of patients in the future. Future treatments of pancreatic cancer will likely be based on the development of novel therapies per genomic and proteomic identifications of cellular/immunological processes and molecular pathways as therapeutic targets. Herein, we systematically review the newer trends in pancreatic cancer treatment with emphasis on the genetic alterations and role of immune therapeutics and targeted therapies.

Abstract: This review examines contemporary strategies for managing brain metastases (BM) from common cancers such as lung, breast, and melanoma. We evaluate the efficacy and applicability of targeted therapies and immunotherapies, exploring their potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and improve patient outcomes. Recent studies have shown that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and ADCs effectively treat BM. These treatments can overcome the challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier and improve therapeutic outcomes. ADCs are promising because they can deliver cytotoxic agents directly to tumor cells, which reduces systemic toxicity and increases drug delivery efficiency to the brain. Personalized medicine is becoming increasingly significant in treatment decisions, with biomarkers playing an essential role. Advances in molecular genetics and drug development have led to more refined treatments, emphasizing the precision medicine framework. The management of BM is evolving, driven by drug efficacy, resistance mechanisms, and the need for personalized medicine. Integrating ADCs into treatment regimens represents a significant advancement in targeting metastatic brain tumors. Despite these advances, BM management still presents considerable challenges, requiring ongoing research and multi-institutional trials to optimize therapeutic strategies. This review outlines the current state and future directions in treating BM, highlighting the critical need for continued innovation and comprehensive clinical evaluations to improve survival rates and quality of life for affected patients.

Abstract: After decades of basic research, immune-based therapeutics for the treatment of cancer are showing evidence of efficacy in clinical trials; several immunotherapeutics already incorporated into standard treatment regimens. Intensive research is underway to improve the efficacy of immunotherapeutics and to expand the application of immunotherapy to a wider array of cancers. The therapeutic options that comprise immunotherapy for cancer are vast and span monoclonal antibodies, tumor vaccines, adoptive cellular therapies, as well as therapies aimed at reversing immunosuppression and enhancing immune reactivity globally and/or locally within the tumor microenvironment. In pediatric cancer, monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated efficacy in hematologic malignancies, and neuroblastoma and bispecific antibodies that activate resident T cells, as well as adoptive cell therapy, have shown recent exciting results for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood. This review discusses the basic principles of tumor immunology driving clinical development of new immunotherapies, describes immunotherapeutics with demonstrated efficacy and several currently in clinical trials, and highlight agents that seem to be most promising for the treatment of pediatric cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular landscape of distinct follicular lymphoma histologic grades: insights from genomic and transcriptome analyses.. Abstract: The 2022 World Health Organization Classification of Haematolymphoid tumours classifies follicular lymphoma grades 1-2 (FL1-2) and grade 3A (FL3A) as classic follicular lymphoma (cFL) and reclassifies grade 3B (FL3B) as follicular large B-cell lymphoma (FLBL), without addressing cases of patients with concurrent FL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\u00a0(FL/DLBCL). However, genetic information on FL histologic grading remains limited, and the latest classification lacks sufficient evidence to resolve whether these subgroups represent single or multiple distinct biological entities. This study analyzed clinical data from 831 patients, whole-exome sequencing (WES) from 149 patients, and transcriptome sequencing from 63 patients to explore differences among FL1-2, FL3A, FL3B, and FL/DLBCL. Clinical analyses revealed two distinct groups: an indolent group (FL1-2 and FL3A) with favorable prognosis and an aggressive group (FL3B and FL/DLBCL) characterized by poor prognosis. Genomics revealed that FL1-2 and FL3A share a common genetic background, whereas FL3B and FL/DLBCL lack mutations in epigenetic regulators CREBBP and KMT2D but exhibit additional copy number variations (CNVs), such as 1p36.32 losses and 3p21.1 gains, which are linked to poor prognosis. Transcriptomics revealed that with increasing histologic grade, immune-related pathway activity decreases, while the activity of metabolic and cell cycle pathways increases, which may be associated with the upregulation of MYC, IRF4, and BATF expression. Together, these findings define FL3B and FL/DLBCL as biologically and clinically distinct B-cell lymphomas, differing from traditional FL. FL1-2 and FL3A differ in their tumor microenvironments rather than genetic profiles. Journal: Leukemia. Year: 2025. Authors: Sun C, Li W, Yu J, Zhang T, Gong W.

Of particular note is the development and approval of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies that involve the use of a patient's own immune system to treat cancers that have proven resistant to other approaches. Keeping abreast of treatment changes and practice guidelines is a challenge for all healthcare professionals, and the pressure of doing so becomes most acute with innovations in cancer therapeutics that have the potential to extend or save lives. Though uncommon, step changes like CAR T-cell therapy pose a challenge, often requiring completely new ways of thinking about efficacy evidence, basic science, ethics and service delivery. At a time when patients are able and empowered to readily access information about novel and exploratory treatments, healthcare professionals need to feel informed enough to help patients with life-changing or life-limiting cancers who approach them for advice. This article gives an overview of the basic principles of CAR T-cell therapy including how it is delivered, who is eligible to receive it in the UK, and a brief outline of current evidence of its efficacy and safety. The information is intended to provide healthcare professionals with an introduction to CAR T-cell therapy to help them advise potentially eligible patients or those already undergoing treatment about what to expect.

Abstract: RNA therapeutics have emerged as potential treatments for genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and cancer. RNA delivery to target cells for efficient therapeutic applications remains challenging due to instability and poor uptake. Polymeric nanoparticulate delivery systems offer stability, protection, and controlled release. These systems shield RNA from degradation, enabling efficient uptake and extended circulation. Various polymeric nanoparticle platforms have been explored, including lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, and polymer-drug conjugates. This review outlines recent breakthroughs of recent advances, design principles, characterization techniques, and performance evaluation of these delivery systems. It highlights their potential in translating preclinical studies into clinical applications. Additionally, the review discusses the application of polymeric nanoparticles in ophthalmic drug delivery, particularly for medications that dissolve poorly in water, and the progress made in siRNA-based therapies for viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. SiRNA holds great promise for precision medicine and therapeutic intervention, with the ability to target specific genes and modulate disease-associated pathways. The versatility and potency of siRNA-based drugs offer a broader scope for therapeutic intervention compared to traditional biological drugs. As research in RNA therapeutics continues to advance, these technologies hold tremendous potential to revolutionize the treatment of various diseases and improve patient outcomes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Predicting clinical outcomes of cancer patients with a p53 deficiency gene signature.. Abstract: The tumor suppressor p53, encoded by the TP53 gene, is mutated or nullified in nearly 50% of human cancers. It has long been debated whether TP53 mutations can be utilized as a biomarker to predict clinical outcomes of cancer patients. In this study, we applied computational methods to calculate p53 deficiency scores (PDSs) that reflect the inactivation of the p53 pathway, instead of TP53 mutation status. Compared to TP53 mutation status, the p53 deficiency gene signature is a powerful predictor of overall survival and drug sensitivity in a variety of cancer types and treatments. Interestingly, the PDSs predicted clinical outcomes more accurately than drug sensitivity in cell lines, suggesting that tumor heterogeneity and/or tumor microenvironment may play an important role in predicting clinical outcomes using p53 deficiency gene signatures.

Proteasome inhibitors have emerged as frontline treatment of relapsed and refractory MM however, resistance to these drugs occur through poorly defined mechanisms. Numerous studies have identified different acquired resistance models such as \u03b25 proteasome subunit mutations and stabilization of tumor suppressors and apoptotic proteins. In addition, recent findings have identified a progenitor organization in MM whereby early progenitor tumor cells show resistance to proteasome inhibitor therapy and cause progressive disease with maturation arrest. This editorial highlights the potential causes of MM relapse in the context of these tumor progenitor cells and the role these cells play in treatment failure.

Abstract: Iodine-resistant cancers account for the vast majority of thyroid related mortality and, until recently, there were limited therapeutic options. However, over the last decade our understanding of the molecular foundation of thyroid function and carcinogenesis has driven the development of many novel therapeutics. These include FDA approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors and small molecular inhibitors of VEGFR, BRAF, MEK, NTRK and RET, which collectively have significantly changed the prognostic outlook for this patient population. Some therapeutics can re-sensitize de-differentiated cancers to iodine, allowing for radioactive iodine treatment and improved disease control. Remarkably, there is now an FDA approved treatment for BRAF-mutated patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer, previously considered invariably and rapidly fatal. The treatment landscape for iodine-resistant thyroid cancer is changing rapidly with many new targets, therapeutics, clinical trials, and approved treatments. We provide an up-to-date review of novel therapeutic options in the treatment of iodine-resistant thyroid cancer. Journal: Frontiers in endocrinology. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTP) superfamily is a key enzyme involved in the regulation of growth-related cell signaling cascades, such as the RAS/MAPK pathway, that directly affect cancer cell growth and metastasis. Several studies have indicated that the drug resistance observed in several late-stage tumors might also be affected by the levels of PTP in the cell. Hence, these phosphatases have been in the limelight for the past few decades as potential drug targets and several promising drug candidates have been developed, even though none of these drugs have reached the market yet. In this review, we explore the potential of PTP as a viable anti-cancer drug target by studying PTPs, their regulation of several key cancer cell signaling pathways, and how their levels affect various types of cancer. Furthermore, we present the current scenario of PTP as a molecular target and the various challenges faced in the development of PTP-targeting anti-cancer drugs.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: BRAF Targeting Across Solid Tumors: Molecular Aspects and Clinical Applications.. Abstract: BRAF mutations are critical drivers in cancers such as melanoma, colorectal cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer. The most common mutation, <i>BRAF V600E</i>, is a key therapeutic target. Targeted treatments with BRAF and MEK inhibitors have significantly improved progression-free and overall survival in melanoma patients. However, in cancers like metastatic colorectal cancer, BRAF mutations are associated with poor outcomes due to aggressive disease behavior and resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Despite progress, resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors remains a major challenge, often driven by secondary mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, activation of alternative pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks)/protein kinase B (AKT), or changes in the tumor microenvironment. These challenges have motivated ongoing research into combining BRAF inhibitors with immunotherapies to enhance and prolong treatment effectiveness. Future research must also account for the role of the cancer's tissue of origin, as the biological context significantly influences response to targeted therapies, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of tumor biology, micro-environment, and genetics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular alterations and targeted therapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.. Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a malignancy characterized by a poor prognosis and high mortality rate. Genetic mutations and altered molecular pathways serve as targets in precise therapy. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), these aberrant alterations can be identified and used to develop strategies that will selectively kill cancerous cells in patients with PDAC. The realization of targeted therapies in patients with PDAC may be summarized by three approaches. First, because oncogenes play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, inhibition of dysregulated oncogenes is a promising method (Table 3). Numerous researchers are developing strategies to target oncogenes, such as KRAS, NRG1, and NTRK and related molecules, although most of the results are unsatisfactory. Accordingly, emerging strategies are being developed to target these oncogenes, including simultaneously inhibiting multiple molecules or pathways, modification of mutant residues by small molecules, and RNA interference. Second, researchers have attempted to reactivate inactivated tumour suppressors or modulate related molecules. TP53, CDKN2A and SMAD4 are three major tumour suppressors involved in PDAC. Advances have been achieved in clinical and preclinical trials of therapies targeting these three genes, and further investigations are warranted. The TGF-\u03b2-SMAD4 signalling pathway plays a dual role in PDAC tumorigenesis and participates in mediating tumour-stroma crosstalk and modulating the tumour microenvironment (TME); thus, molecular subtyping of pancreatic cancer according to the SMAD4 mutation status may be a promising precision oncology technique. Finally, genes such as KDM6A and BRCA have vital roles in maintaining the structural stability and physiological functions of normal chromosomes and are deficient in some patients with PDAC, thus serving as potential targets for correcting these deficiencies and precisely killing these aberrant tumour cells. Recent clinical trials, such as the POLO (Pancreas Cancer Olaparib Ongoing) trial, have reported encouraging outcomes. In addition to genetic event-guided treatment, immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T), antibody-drug conjugates, and immune checkpoint inhibitors also exhibit the potential to target tumours precisely, although the clinical value of immunotherapies as treatments for PDAC is still limited. In this review, we focus on recent preclinical and clinical advances in therapies targeting aberrant genes and pathways and predict the future trend of precision oncology for PDAC.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting the Sphingolipid Rheostat in Gliomas.. Abstract: Gliomas are highly aggressive cancer types that are in urgent need of novel drugs and targeted therapies. Treatment protocols have not improved in over a decade, and glioma patient survival remains among the worst of all cancer types. As a result, cancer metabolism research has served as an innovative approach to identifying novel glioma targets and improving our understanding of brain tumors. Recent research has uncovered a unique metabolic vulnerability in the sphingolipid pathways of gliomas that possess the IDH1 mutation. Sphingolipids are a family of lipid signaling molecules that play a variety of second messenger functions in cellular regulation. The two primary metabolites, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide, maintain a rheostat balance and play opposing roles in cell survival and proliferation. Altering the rheostat such that the pro-apoptotic signaling of the ceramides outweighs the pro-survival S1P signaling in glioma cells diminishes the hallmarks of cancer and enhances tumor cell death. Throughout this review, we discuss the sphingolipid pathway and identify the enzymes that can be most effectively targeted to alter the sphingolipid rheostat and enhance apoptosis in gliomas. We discuss each pathway's steps based on their site of occurrence in the organelles and postulate novel targets that can effectively exploit this vulnerability.

Abstract: A relevant challenge for the improvement of clear cell renal cell carcinoma management could derive from the identification of novel molecular biomarkers that could greatly improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment choice of these neoplasms. In this study, we investigate whether quantitative parameters obtained from computed tomography texture analysis may correlate with the expression of selected oncogenic microRNAs. In a retrospective single-center study, multiphasic computed tomography examination (with arterial, portal, and urographic phases) was performed on 20 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and computed tomography texture analysis parameters such as entropy, kurtosis, skewness, mean, and standard deviation of pixel distribution were measured using multiple filter settings. These quantitative data were correlated with the expression of selected microRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-210-3p, miR-185-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-145-5p). Both the evaluations (microRNAs and computed tomography texture analysis) were performed on matched tumor and normal corticomedullar tissues of the same patients cohort. In this pilot study, we evidenced that computed tomography texture analysis has robust parameters (eg, entropy, mean, standard deviation) to distinguish normal from pathological tissues. Moreover, a higher coefficient of determination between entropy and miR-21-5p expression was evidenced in tumor versus normal tissue. Interestingly, entropy and miR-21-5p show promising correlation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma opening to a radiogenomic strategy to improve clear cell renal cell carcinoma management. In this pilot study, a promising correlation between microRNAs and computed tomography texture analysis has been found in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. A clear cell renal cell carcinoma can benefit from noninvasive evaluation of texture parameters in adjunction to biopsy results. In particular, a promising correlation between entropy and miR-21-5p was found. Journal: Technology in cancer research & treatment. Year: 2019.

Abstract: Over the past decade, non-coding RNA-based therapeutics have proven as a great potential for the development of targeted therapies for cancer and other diseases. The discovery of the critical function of microRNAs (miRNAs) has generated great excitement in developing miRNA-based therapies. The dysregulation of miRNAs contributes to the pathogenesis of various human diseases and cancers by modulating genes that are involved in critical cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis, drug resistance, and tumorigenesis. miRNA (miRNA mimic, anti-miRNA/antagomir) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) can inhibit the expression of any cancer-related genes/mRNAs with high specificity through RNA interference (RNAi), thus representing a remarkable therapeutic tool for targeted therapies and precision medicine. siRNA and miRNA-based therapies have entered clinical trials and recently three novel siRNA-based therapeutics were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), indicating the beginning of a new era of targeted therapeutics. The successful clinical applications of miRNA and siRNA therapeutics rely on safe and effective nanodelivery strategies for targeting tumor cells or tumor microenvironment. For this purpose, promising nanodelivery/nanoparticle-based approaches have been developed using a variety of molecules for systemic administration and improved tumor targeted delivery with reduced side effects. In this review, we present an overview of RNAi-based therapeutics, the major pharmaceutical challenges, and the perspectives for the development of promising delivery systems for clinical translation. We also highlight the passive and active tumor targeting nanodelivery strategies and primarily focus on the current applications of nanoparticle-based delivery formulations for tumor targeted RNAi molecules and their recent advances in clinical trials in human cancers.

Abstract: Understanding the role of circulating proteins in prostate cancer risk can reveal key biological pathways and identify novel targets for cancer prevention. We investigated the association of 2002 genetically predicted circulating protein levels with risk of prostate cancer overall, and of aggressive and early onset disease, using cis-pQTL Mendelian randomisation (MR) and colocalisation. Findings for proteins with support from both MR, after correction for multiple-testing, and colocalisation were replicated using two independent cancer GWAS, one of European and one of African ancestry. Proteins with evidence of prostate-specific tissue expression were additionally investigated using spatial transcriptomic data in prostate tumour tissue to assess their role in tumour aggressiveness. Finally, we mapped risk proteins to drug and ongoing clinical trials targets. We identified 20 proteins genetically linked to prostate cancer risk (14 for overall [8 specific], 7 for aggressive [3 specific], and 8 for early onset disease [2 specific]), of which the majority replicated where data were available. Among these were proteins associated with aggressive disease, such as PPA2 [Odds Ratio (OR) per 1 SD increment\u00a0=\u00a02.13, 95% CI: 1.54-2.93], PYY [OR\u00a0=\u00a01.87, 95% CI: 1.43-2.44] and PRSS3 [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.80, 95% CI: 0.73-0.89], and those associated with early onset disease, including EHPB1 [OR\u00a0=\u00a02.89, 95% CI: 1.99-4.21], POGLUT3 [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.76, 95% CI: 0.67-0.86] and TPM3 [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.64]. We confirmed an inverse association of MSMB with prostate cancer overall [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.81, 95% CI: 0.80-0.82], and also found an inverse association with both aggressive [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.84, 95% CI: 0.82-0.86] and early onset disease [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.71, 95% CI: 0.68-0.74]. Using spatial transcriptomics data, we identified MSMB as the genome-wide top-most predictive gene to distinguish benign regions from high grade cancer regions that comparatively had five-fold lower MSMB expression. Additionally, ten proteins that were associated with prostate cancer risk also mapped to existing therapeutic interventions. Our findings emphasise the importance of proteomics for improving our understanding of prostate cancer aetiology and of opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions. Additionally, we demonstrate the added benefit of in-depth functional analyses to triangulate the role of risk proteins in the clinical aggressiveness of prostate tumours. Using these integrated methods, we identify a subset of risk proteins associated with aggressive and early onset disease as priorities for investigation for the future prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.

Abstract: Studying the molecular heterogeneity of cancer is essential for achieving personalized therapy. At the same time, understanding the biological processes that drive cancer development can lead to the identification of valuable therapeutic targets. Therefore, achieving accurate and interpretable clinical predictions requires paramount attention to thoroughly characterizing patients at both the molecular and biological pathway levels. Here, we present GraphPath, a biological knowledge-driven graph neural network with multi-head self-attention mechanism that implements the pathway-pathway interaction network. We train GraphPath to classify the cancer status of patients with prostate cancer based on their multi-omics profiling. Experiment results show that our method outperforms P-NET and other baseline methods. Besides, two external cohorts are used to validate that the model can be generalized to unseen samples with adequate predictive performance. We reduce the dimensionality of latent pathway embeddings and visualize corresponding classes to further demonstrate the optimal performance of the model. Additionally, since GraphPath's predictions are interpretable, we identify target cancer-associated pathways that significantly contribute to the model's predictions. Such a robust and interpretable model has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of cancer's biological mechanisms and accelerate the development of targeted therapies. https://github.com/amazingma/GraphPath.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Comprehensive Detection of Pseudogenes Transcribed by Readthrough.. Abstract: Transcription termination is a critical stage for the production of legitimate mRNAs, and consequently functional proteins. However, the transcription machinery can ignore the stop signs and continue elongating beyond gene boundaries, invading downstream neighboring genes. Such phenomenon, designated transcription readthrough, can trigger the expression of pseudogenes usually silenced or lacking the proper regulatory signals. Due to the sequence similarity to parental genes, readthrough transcribed pseudogenes can regulate relevant protein-coding genes and impact biological functions. Here, we describe a computational pipeline that employs already existent bioinformatic tools to detect readthrough transcribed pseudogenes from expression profiles. We also unveil that combining strand-specific transcriptome data and epigenetic profiles can enhance and corroborate the results. By applying such approach to renal cancer biopsies, we show that pseudogenes can be readthrough transcribed as part of unspliced transcripts or processed RNA chimeras. Overall, our pipeline allows us to scrutinize transcriptome profiles to detect a diversity of readthrough events leading to expression of pseudogenes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Novel Holistic Approaches for Overcoming Therapy Resistance in Pancreatic and Colon Cancers.. Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, such as of the colon and pancreas, are highly resistant to both standard and targeted therapeutics. Therapy-resistant and heterogeneous GI cancers harbor highly complex signaling networks (the resistome) that resist apoptotic programming. Commonly used gemcitabine or platinum-based regimens fail to induce meaningful (i.e. disease-reversing) perturbations in the resistome, resulting in high rates of treatment failure. The GI cancer resistance networks are, in part, due to interactions between parallel signaling and aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) that collectively promote the development and survival of drug-resistant cancer stem cells with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics. The lack of understanding of the resistance networks associated with this subpopulation of cells as well as reductionist, single protein-/pathway-targeted approaches have made 'effective drug design' a difficult task. We propose that the successful design of novel therapeutic regimens to target drug-resistant GI tumors is only possible if network-based drug avenues and agents, in particular 'natural agents' with no known toxicity, are correctly identified. Natural agents (dietary agents or their synthetic derivatives) can individually alter miRNA profiles, suppress EMT pathways and eliminate cancer stem-like cells that derive from pancreatic cancer and colon cancer, by partially targeting multiple yet meaningful networks within the GI cancer resistome. However, the efficacy of these agents as combinations (e.g. consumed in the diet) against this resistome has never been studied. This short review article provides an overview of the different challenges involved in the understanding of the GI resistome, and how novel computational biology can help in the design of effective therapies to overcome resistance.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Prostate Cancer's Silent Partners: Fibroblasts and Their Influence on Glutamine Metabolism Manipulation.. Abstract: Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)s in the tumour microenvironment (TME) modulate the extracellular matrix, interact with cancer cells, and facilitate communication with infiltrating leukocytes, significantly contributing to cancer progression and therapeutic response. In prostate cancer (PCa), CAFs promote malignancy through metabolic rewiring, cancer stem cell regulation, and therapy resistance. Pre-clinical studies indicate that targeting amino acid metabolism, particularly glutamine (Gln) metabolism, reduces cancer proliferation and stemness. However, most studies lack the context of CAF-cancer interaction, focusing on monocultures. This study assesses the influence of CAFs on PCa growth by manipulating Gln metabolism using colour-labelled PCa cell lines (red) and fibroblast (green) in a co-culture system to evaluate CAFs' effects on PCa cell proliferation and clonogenic potential. CAFs increased the proliferation of hormone-sensitive LNCaP cells, whereas the castration-resistant C4-2 cells were unaffected. However, clonogenic growth increased in both cell lines. Gln deprivation and GLS1 inhibition experiments revealed that the increased growth rate of LNCAP cells was associated with increased dependence on Gln, which was confirmed by proteomic analyses. Tissue analysis of PCa patients revealed elevated GLS1 levels in both the PCa epithelium and stroma, suggesting that GLS1 is a therapeutic target. Moreover, the median overall survival analysis of GLS1 expression in the PCa epithelium and stroma identified a \"high-risk\" patient group that may benefit from GLS1-targeted therapies. Therefore, GLS1 targeting appears promising in castration-resistant PCa patients with high GLS1 epithelium and low GLS1 stromal expression. Journal: International journal of molecular sciences.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: PLD1 is a key player in cancer stemness and chemoresistance: Therapeutic targeting of cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways.. Abstract: The development of chemoresistance is a major challenge in the treatment of several types of cancers in clinical settings. Stemness and chemoresistance are the chief causes of poor clinical outcomes. In this context, we hypothesized that understanding the signaling pathways responsible for chemoresistance in cancers is crucial for the development of novel targeted therapies to overcome drug resistance. Among the aberrantly activated pathways, the PI3K-Akt/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is clinically implicated in malignancies such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Aberrant dysregulation of phospholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in several malignancies, and oncogenic activation of this pathway facilitates tumor proliferation, stemness, and chemoresistance. Crosstalk involving the PLD and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways promotes the progression of CRC and GBM and reduces the sensitivity of cancer cells to standard therapies. Notably, both pathways are tightly regulated and connected at multiple levels by upstream and downstream effectors. Thus, gaining deeper insights into the interactions between these pathways would help researchers discover unique therapeutic targets for the management of drug-resistant cancers. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms by which PLD signaling stimulates stemness and chemoresistance in CRC and GBM. Thus, the current review aims to address the importance of PLD as a central player coordinating cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways and proposes the possibility of targeting these pathways to improve cancer therapy and overcome drug resistance.

Abstract: The clinical heterogeneity of early-stage endometrial cancer (EC) is worthy of further study to identify high-quality prognostic markers and their potential role in aggressive tumor behavior. Mutation of TP53 was considered as an important primary triage in modified molecular typing for EC, it still cannot precisely predict the prognosis of EC. After proteomic analysis of cancer and para-cancerous tissues from 24 early-stage endometrioid EC patients with different survival outcomes, 13 differentially expressed proteins were screen out while 2 proteins enriched in p53 signaling pathway were further identified by single-cell transcriptome (scRNA-seq). Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor type-1 receptor-associated protein (TRAP1) and calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein family member 3 (CAMSAP3) were found to be significantly downregulated in the specific cell cluster. Expectedly, the signature genes of TRAP1<sup>low</sup>/CAMSAP3<sup>low</sup> cluster included classical oncogenes. Moreover, close cellular interactions were observed between myeloid cells and the TRAP1<sup>low</sup>/CAMSAP3<sup>low</sup> cluster after systematically elucidating their relationship with tumor microenvironment (TME). The expression of TRAP1 and CAMSAP3 was verified by immunohistochemistry. Thus, a novel prediction model combining TRAP1, CAMSAP3 and TP53 was construct by multi-omics. Compared with the area under the curve, it demonstrated a significantly improvemrnt in the diagnostic efficacy in EC patients from TCGA bank. In conclusion, this work improved the current knowledge regarding the prognosis of early-stage EC through proteomics and scRNA-seq. These findings may lead to improvements in precise risk stratification of early-stage EC patients. Journal: Molecular cancer. Year: 2024. Authors: Mao X, Tang X, Ye J, Xu S, Wang Y.

Abstract: Most women with advanced ovarian cancer will relapse and subsequently develop platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. The benefit of treatment is currently based on objective response rates, which are a crude measure of benefit. It would be clinically meaningful if we were better able to measure the benefit of palliative therapy and, in particular, ascertain whether cancer-related symptoms improve with treatment and how this impacts on quality of life. This paper reviews the management of patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer and highlights the gaps in our knowledge and shortcomings with the current approaches to measure the benefit of treatment. The ultimate objective is to describe and encourage recruitment to the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup study that has recently opened. This study will recruit a large number of patients from around the world in an effort to develop more robust instruments to measure the benefit of chemotherapy and to understand the impact of chemotherapy on symptom control and quality of life. In addition, this study will give us an insight into how all patients are managed rather than a select minority who are treated in clinical trials.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: 5-Azacytidine prevents relapse and produces long-term complete remissions in leukemia xenografts treated with Moxetumomab pasudotox.. Abstract: Moxetumomab pasudotox (Moxe) is a chimeric protein composed of an anti-CD22 Fv fused to a portion of <i>Pseudomonas</i> exotoxin A and kills CD22-expressing leukemia cells. It is very active in hairy-cell leukemia, but many children with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) either respond transiently or are initially resistant. Resistance to Moxe in cultured cells is due to low expression of diphthamide genes (DPH), but only two of six ALL blast samples from resistant patients had low DPH expression. To develop a more clinically relevant model of resistance, we treated NSG mice bearing KOPN-8 or Reh cells with Moxe. More than 99.9% of the cancer cells were killed by Moxe, but relapse occurred from discrete bone marrow sites. The resistant cells would no longer grow in cell culture and showed major chromosomal changes and changes in phenotype with greatly decreased CD22. RNA deep sequencing of resistant KOPN-8 blasts revealed global changes in gene expression, indicating dedifferentiation toward less-mature B cell precursors, and showed an up-regulation of myeloid genes. When Moxe was combined with 5-azacytidine, resistance was prevented and survival increased to over 5 months in the KOPN-8 model and greatly improved in the Reh model. We conclude that Moxe resistance in mice is due to a new mechanism that could not be observed using cultured cells and is prevented by treatment with 5-azacytidine.

Abstract: The aim of the study is to better understand the mechanism of relapse and acquired clinical resistance to arsenic trioxide (ATO) and/or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Thirty relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients were followed. Fifteen patients experienced two or more relapses; nine patients had clinical resistance to ATO-based therapy. The frequency and clinical significance of promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) mutational status using Sanger sequencing were evaluated. Overall, eight different types of mutations in the RARA region (V218D, R272Q, T278A, T291I, N299D, R294W, A300G, and L220_F228delinsP) were identified in 11 patients. Eight missense mutations (L211P, C213R, S214L, A216V, L217F, D219H, S221G, and D241G) were found in the PML portion of PML-RARA in 14 patients, with A216V as the predominant mutation. Eight patients were found to harbor both PML and RARA mutations over the course of the disease. The PML-region mutations were associated with response to ATO-based therapy (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), number of relapses (P\u2009=\u20090.001), and early relapse (P\u2009=\u20090.013). Notably, one case sampled at nine different time points showed alternating clonal dominance over the course of treatment. This study demonstrated frequent mutations of PML-RARA and supported a clonal selection model in relation to APL relapse and ATO resistance. Journal: Annals of hematology. Year: 2015.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Small-molecule inhibitors of WNT signalling in cancer therapy and their links to autophagy and apoptosis.. Abstract: Cancer represents an intricate and heterogeneous ailment that evolves from a multitude of epigenetic and genetic variations that disrupt normal cellular function. The WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway is essential in maintaining the balance between cell renewal and differentiation in various tissues. Abnormal activation of this pathway can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and initiate cancer across a variety of tissues such as the colon, skin, liver, and ovary. It enhances characteristics that lead to cancer progression, including angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Processes like autophagy and apoptosis which regulate cell death and play a crucial role in maintaining cellular equilibrium are also intimately linked with WNT/ \u03b2-catenin pathway. Thus, targeting WNT pathway has become a key strategy in developing antitumor therapies. Employing small molecule inhibitors has emerged as a targeted therapy to improve the clinical outcome compared to conventional cancer treatments. Many strategies using small molecule inhibitors for modulating the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway, such as hindering WNT ligands' secretion or interaction, disrupting receptor complex, and blocking the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin have been investigated. These interventions have shown promise in both preclinical and clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway's role in cancer, emphasizing its regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. Our goal is to highlight the potential of specific small molecule inhibitors targeting this pathway, fostering the development of novel, tailored cancer treatments.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Breast Heterogeneity: Obstacles to Developing Universal Biomarkers of Breast Cancer Initiation and Progression.. Abstract: Predicting outcomes and response to therapy through biomarkers is a major challenge in cancer research. In previous studies, we suggested that inappropriate \"normal\" tissue samples used for comparison with tumors, inter-individual heterogeneity in gene expression, and genetic ancestry all influence biomarker expression in tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate these factors in breast cancer using breast tissues from healthy women and normal tissue adjacent to tumor (NAT) with matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) as a candidate biomarker. RNA sequencing was performed on primary luminal progenitor cells from healthy breast, NATs, and tumors to identify transcriptomes enriched in NATs and breast cancer. Expression of select genes was validated via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of RNA and via immunohistochemistry of a tissue microarray of normal, NAT, and tumor samples of different genetic ancestry. Twenty-six genes were significantly overexpressed in NATs and tumors compared with healthy controls at messenger RNA level and formed a para-inflammatory network. MMP7 had the greatest expression in tumor cells, with upregulation confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Tumor-enriched but not NAT-enriched expression of MMP7 compared with healthy controls was reproduced at protein levels. When stratified by genetic ancestry, tumor-specific increase of MMP7 reached statistical significance in women of European ancestry. Transcriptome differences across healthy, NAT, and tumor tissue in breast cancer demonstrate an active para-inflammatory network in NATs and indicate unsuitability of NATs as \"normal controls\" in biomarker discovery. The discordance between transcriptomic and proteomic MMP7 expression in NATs and the influence of genetic ancestry on its protein expression highlight the complexity in developing universally acceptable biomarkers of breast cancer and the importance of genetic ancestry in biomarker development.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Sigma1 Pharmacology in the Context of Cancer.. Abstract: Sigma1 (also known as sigma-1 receptor, Sig1R, \u03c31 receptor) is a unique pharmacologically regulated integral membrane chaperone or scaffolding protein. The majority of publications on the subject have focused on the neuropharmacology of Sigma1. However, a number of publications have also suggested a role for Sigma1 in cancer. Although there is currently no clinically used anti-cancer drug that targets Sigma1, a growing body of evidence supports the potential of Sigma1 ligands as therapeutic agents to treat cancer. In preclinical models, compounds with affinity for Sigma1 have been reported to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and survival, cell adhesion and migration, tumor growth, to alleviate cancer-associated pain, and to have immunomodulatory properties. This review will highlight that although the literature supports a role for Sigma1 in cancer, several fundamental questions regarding drug mechanism of action and the physiological relevance of aberrant SIGMAR1 transcript and Sigma1 protein expression in certain cancers remain unanswered or only partially answered. However, emerging lines of evidence suggest that Sigma1 is a component of the cancer cell support machinery, that it facilitates protein interaction networks, that it allosterically modulates the activity of its associated proteins, and that Sigma1 is a selectively multifunctional drug target.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting base excision repair in precision oncology.. Abstract: Targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) is a key strategy in cancer therapy, leveraging tumour-specific weaknesses in DNA repair pathways to enhance treatment efficacy. Traditional treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, use a broad, damage-inducing approach, whereas precision oncology aims to tailor therapies to specific genetic mutations or vulnerabilities. The clinical success of PARP inhibitors has renewed the interest in targeting DNA repair as a therapeutic strategy. Expanding the precision oncology toolbox by targeting the base excision repair (BER) pathway presents a promising avenue for cancer therapy, particularly in tumours that rely heavily on this pathway due to deficiencies in other DNA repair mechanisms. This review discusses how targeting BER could improve treatment outcomes, particularly in DDR-defective cancers. With ongoing advancements in biomarker discovery and drug development, BER-targeted therapies hold significant potential for refining precision oncology approaches. Journal: DNA repair. Year: 2025.

First and second-line therapies include purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs) and rituximab, but until recently, limited alternative options were available for patients with two or more relapses. The aim of this study is to describe our real-life experience with HCL patients in third and fourth-line therapies. Data from 49 HCL patients with two or more relapses, including 16 patients with three or more relapses, were collected from the French retrospective HCL cohort covering the period from 1980 until 2011. They were analyzed to assess hematological response, relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) after third (L3) and fourth line (L4). The median age at diagnosis was 53\u2009years. PNAs were the most frequently used treatments. As L3 therapy, 29 patients received PNAs (66%) and 15 (34%) other treatments (rituximab [11%] or interferon [7%] alone or in combination [16%]). The distribution of L4 treatments was similar. The overall hematological response rate (OHRR) after L3 was 97% (complete hematological response 86%) with a 40% five-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), a median RFS of 104\u2009months, and a median OS of 235\u2009months. After L4, the OHRR was 94% with a two-year CIR of fourth relapse of 27%. Eleven secondary cancers (5-year cumulative incidence of 12%) were diagnosed in 10 patients. Patients with \u22652 relapses experience frequent further relapses, with increasingly shorter time to next treatment as the number of treatment lines increases. Furthermore, treatment strategies are associated with substantial toxicities. All these points lead to the need for novel treatments. Journal: Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.). Year: 2022.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. High-risk locally advanced or recurrent/metastatic cervical cancers have a poor prognosis with routine treatments. The objective of this study is to analyze the data available in the literature on therapies and molecules currently in use to improve the prognosis of recurrent cervical cancer. An extensive literature search was conducted by authors to identify relevant trials on various databases. Articles in English published until September 2023 that investigate different pharmacotherapy strategies for the treatment of recurrent cervical cancer, were included. Results of various pharmacological regimens including different combinations of chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, DNA damage repair inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates were analyzed. In recent years, there have been significant improvements in the outcomes of recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer. However, these improvements do not address the unmet need in terms of oncological outcomes. The introduction of immunotherapy and targeted therapies showed advantages in cervical cancer patients. New therapies and combination strategies must be implemented. Centralization of care and enrollment in clinical trials are of paramount importance. Primary and secondary prevention remains the fundamental goal to reduce the burden of cervical cancer. Journal: Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Genomic alterations underlie a pan-cancer metabolic shift associated with tumour hypoxia.. Abstract: Altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer. However, the role of genomic changes in metabolic genes driving the tumour metabolic shift remains to be elucidated. Here, we have investigated the genomic and transcriptomic changes underlying this shift across ten different cancer types. A systematic pan-cancer analysis of 6538 tumour/normal samples covering ten major cancer types identified a core metabolic signature of 44 genes that exhibit high frequency somatic copy number gains/amplifications (>20\u00a0% cases) associated with increased mRNA expression (\u03c1\u2009>\u20090.3, q\u2009<\u200910(-3)). Prognostic classifiers using these genes were confirmed in independent datasets for breast and kidney cancers. Interestingly, this signature is strongly associated with hypoxia, with nine out of ten cancer types showing increased expression and five out of ten cancer types showing increased gain/amplification of these genes in hypoxic tumours (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01). Further validation in breast and colorectal cancer cell lines highlighted squalene epoxidase, an oxygen-requiring enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, as a driver of dysregulated metabolism and a key player in maintaining cell survival under hypoxia. This study reveals somatic genomic alterations underlying a pan-cancer metabolic shift and suggests genomic adaptation of these genes as a survival mechanism in hypoxic tumours.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Robust identification of common genomic biomarkers from multiple gene expression profiles for the prognosis, diagnosis, and therapies of pancreatic cancer.. Abstract: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death globally. So, identification of potential molecular signatures is required for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapies of PC. In this study, we detected 71 common differentially expressed genes (cDEGs) between PC and control samples from four microarray gene-expression datasets (GSE15471, GSE16515, GSE71989, and GSE22780) by using robust statistical and machine learning approaches, since microarray gene-expression datasets are often contaminated by outliers due to several steps involved in the data generating processes. Then we detected 8 cDEGs (ADAM10, COL1A2, FN1, P4HB, ITGB1, ITGB5, ANXA2, and MYOF) as the PC-causing key genes (KGs) by the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. We validated the expression patterns of KGs between case and control samples by box plot analysis with the TCGA and GTEx databases. The proposed KGs showed high prognostic power with the random forest (RF) based prediction model and Kaplan-Meier-based survival probability curve. The KGs regulatory network analysis detected few transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators for KGs. The cDEGs-set enrichment analysis revealed some crucial PC-causing molecular functions, biological processes, cellular components, and pathways that are associated with KGs. Finally, we suggested KGs-guided five repurposable drug molecules (Linsitinib, CX5461, Irinotecan, Timosaponin AIII, and Olaparib) and a new molecule (NVP-BHG712) against PC by molecular docking. The stability of the top three protein-ligand complexes was confirmed by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies. The cross-validation and some literature reviews also supported our findings. Therefore, the finding of this study might be useful resources to the researchers and medical doctors for diagnosis, prognosis and therapies of PC by the wet-lab validation.

Abstract: Targeting K-RAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with novel inhibitors has shown promising results with the recent approval of sotorasib in this indication. However, progression to this agent is expected, as it has previously been observed with other inhibitors. Recently, new immune therapeutics, including vectorized compounds with antibodies or modulators of the host immune response, have demonstrated clinical activity. By interrogating massive datasets, including TCGA, we identified genes that code for surface membrane proteins that are selectively expressed in K-RAS mutated NSCLC and that could be used to vectorize novel therapies. Two genes, <i>CLDN10</i> and <i>TMPRSS6</i>, were selected for their clear differentiation. In addition, we discovered immunologic correlates of outcome that were clearly de-regulated in this particular tumor type and we matched them with immune cell populations. In conclusion, our article describes membrane proteins and immunologic correlates that could be used to better select and optimize current therapies. Journal: Frontiers in immunology. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Despite manifold advances in oncology, cancers of the central nervous system remain among the most lethal. Unique features of the brain, including distinct cellular composition, immunological privilege, and physical barriers to therapeutic delivery, likely contribute to the poor prognosis of patients with neuro-oncological disease. Focused ultrasound is an emerging technology that allows transcranial delivery of ultrasound energy to focal brain targets with great precision. A review of the clinical and preclinical focused ultrasound literature was performed to obtain data regarding the current state of the focused ultrasound in context of neuro-oncology. A narrative review was then constructed to provide an overview of current and future applications of this technology. Focused ultrasound can facilitate direct control of tumors by thermal or mechanical ablation, as well as enhance delivery of diverse therapeutics by disruption of the blood-brain barrier without local tissue damage. Indeed, ultrasound-sensitive drug formulations or sonosensitizers may be combined with ultrasound blood-brain barrier disruption to achieve high local drug concentration while limiting systemic exposure to therapeutics. Furthermore, focused ultrasound can induce radiosensitization, immunomodulation, and neuromodulation. Here we review applications of focused ultrasound with a focus on approaches currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of neuro-oncological disease, such as blood-brain barrier disruption for drug delivery and thermal ablation. We also discuss design of clinical trials, selection of patient cohorts, and emerging approaches to improve the efficacy of transcranial ultrasound, such as histotripsy, as well as combinatorial strategies to exploit synergistic biological effects of existing cancer therapies and ultrasound. Focused ultrasound is a promising and actively expanding therapeutic modality for diverse neuro-oncological diseases. Journal: Journal of neuro-oncology. Year: 2022.

Abstract: Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are capable of killing virally infected and/or cancerous cells. Nearly 20 years ago, NK cell-mediated immunotherapy emerged as a safe and effective treatment approach for patients with advanced-stage leukaemia. Subsequently, the field of NK cell-based cancer therapy has grown exponentially and currently constitutes a major area of immunotherapy innovation. In general, the development of NK cell-directed therapies has two main focal points: optimizing the source of therapeutic NK cells for adoptive transfer and enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity and persistence in vivo. A wide variety of sources of therapeutic NK cells are currently being tested clinically, including haploidentical NK cells, umbilical cord blood NK cells, stem cell-derived NK cells, NK cell lines, adaptive NK cells, cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells and chimeric antigen receptor NK cells. A plethora of methods to augment the cytotoxicity and longevity of NK cells are also under clinical investigation, including cytokine-based agents, NK cell-engager molecules and immune-checkpoint inhibitors. In this Review, we highlight the variety of ways in which diverse NK cell products and their auxiliary therapeutics are being leveraged to target human cancers. We also identify future avenues for NK cell therapy research. Journal: Nature reviews. Clinical oncology. Year: 2021. Authors: Myers JA, Miller JS.

Abstract: Metastatic prostate cancers generally rely on androgen receptor (AR) signaling for growth and survival, even following systemic androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). However, recent evidence suggests that some advanced prostate cancers escape ADT by using signaling programs and growth factors that bypass canonical AR ligand-mediated mechanisms. We used an in vitro high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify pathways in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines whose loss-of-function promotes androgen ligand-independent growth. We identified 40 genes where knockdown promoted proliferation of both LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cells in the absence of androgen. Of these, 14 were downregulated in primary and metastatic prostate cancer, including two subunits of the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) holoenzyme complex: PPP2R1A, a structural subunit with known tumor-suppressor properties in several tumor types; and PPP2R2C, a PP2A substrate-binding regulatory subunit that has not been previously identified as a tumor suppressor. We show that loss of PPP2R2C promotes androgen ligand depletion-resistant prostate cancer growth without altering AR expression or canonical AR-regulated gene expression. Furthermore, cell proliferation induced by PPP2R2C loss was not inhibited by the AR antagonist MDV3100, indicating that PPP2R2C loss may promote growth independently of known AR-mediated transcriptional programs. Immunohistochemical analysis of PPP2R2C protein levels in primary prostate tumors determined that low PPP2R2C expression significantly associated with an increased likelihood of cancer recurrence and cancer-specific mortality. These findings provide insights into mechanisms by which prostate cancers resist AR-pathway suppression and support inhibiting PPP2R2C complexes or the growth pathway(s) activated by PPP2R2C as a therapeutic strategy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Identifying cancer relapse using SEER-Medicare data.. Abstract: Tumor registries capture valid information at the time of cancer diagnosis, but often do not conduct longitudinal follow-up evaluations. However, investigators may be interested in questions relating to subsequent relapsed disease. Linking administrative data to registry data, as in the creation of the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) and Medicare data set, can provide the ability to infer the occurrence of relapse in selected situations. The authors created different algorithms to detect relapse of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). A retrospective cohort of patients with AML was identified, and both their billing data and medical records were obtained. The algorithms were then applied to the billing data, the results were compared with medical record review. Eighty-nine patients were identified, of whom 22 were treated for relapsed AML. The sensitivity of the best algorithm for detecting relapse was 86%, and the specificity 99%, with a positive predictive value of 95% and a negative predictive value of 96%. Identification of relapse from SEER-Medicare data using clinical algorithms is feasible for cancers where a majority of patients receive treatment for relapse, without a \"watch and wait\" strategy, and where that treatment is with a modality that can be detected in billing data (ie, intravenous chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or all three). Optimal analytic situations are ones in which the investigator is mostly interested in positive predictive value, less interested in sensitivity, and wants to evaluate outcomes among those patients who receive treatment for their relapsed disease. However, the accuracy of such an approach for cancers other than AML has not yet been established. Journal: Medical care. Year: 2002. Authors: Earle CC, Nattinger AB, Potosky AL, Lang K, Mallick R.

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecular-targeted therapies have dominated recent cancer treatment. However, these treatments face challenges, such as primary and acquired resistance, indicating that not all patients benefit from them. Therefore, the search for new molecular targets is crucial. In addition, immune checkpoint inhibitors have exhibited racial differences in their effectiveness for certain neoplasms. Hence, understanding the genomic landscape of cancers in various racial groups is important. In Japan, health insurance has covered comprehensive genomic profiling since 2019, and the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) has accumulated genetic abnormalities along with clinical data of patients with various cancers. These data are crucial for advancing cancer research and drug development. This review discusses the genetic abnormalities of the major skin malignancies including melanoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), and extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD), and proposes potential treatment strategies by comparing C-CAT data analysis with other genetic studies. The C-CAT data have emphasized unique genetic alterations in tumors of the Japanese population, particularly racial differences in tumor mutational burden in cutaneous melanoma and cSCC, indicating the importance of personalized treatment strategies that consider racial differences.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Immunotherapy in Gastroesophageal Cancers: Current Evidence and Ongoing Trials.. Abstract: Data supporting the use of immunotherapy in the treatment of gastroesophageal cancer continues to evolve. The promising results from adjuvant immunotherapy and trials combining immunotherapy plus chemotherapy in the 1L setting have led to broad US FDA approvals. Among the PD-L1 negative subgroups, the magnitude of benefit is diminished; effective therapy for this population remains an unmet need. A detailed biologic understanding of the PD-L1 negative (and low) population represents a barrier to developing effective combination therapies, although combination angiogenesis inhibitors and immunotherapy look encouraging. Early phase clinical trials, particularly with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib (EPOC 1706), demonstrated a clear signal independent of PD-L1, and a confirmatory phase III trial of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib is planned. Conceptually, it is important to think of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy as targeted therapy, most active in clearly defined biomarker-selected populations. Pre-planned analyses have reliably shown a clear trend toward a greater magnitude of benefit in patients with higher PD-L1 expression, particularly CPS\u2009\u2265\u20095 and\u2009\u2265\u200910. Whether there is a linear relationship at higher cutoffs is not well known, though it likely represents smaller and smaller populations. Although beyond the scope of this clinically oriented review, recognition of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in PD-L1 expression is important and repeat testing from progression samples across lines of therapy should be considered. Questions about additional predictive biomarkers, particularly plasma-derived, remain. Responses by tumor histology and location also differ, and special attention to these factors as well as MSI-H, HER2, and EBV subgroups in future trials is warranted. Questions regarding the incorporation of immunotherapy after progression on 1L immunotherapy plus chemotherapy combinations will arise as these combinations are used more frequently, and this represents a key area of future investigation. Overall, the role of immunotherapy continues to expand in GEA, and we welcome any additional tools for this difficult-to-treat group of cancers. Journal: Current treatment options in oncology.

Abstract: Despite great improvements in the outcome of patients with lymphoma, some may still relapse or present with primary refractory disease. In these situations, allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative option, in particular in the case of relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation. Recently, novel agents such as anti-PD1 and BTK inhibitors have started to challenge the use of allo-HCT for relapsed or refractory lymphoma. During the 2016 annual workshop of the Francophone Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (SFGM-TC), we performed a comprehensive review of the literature published in the last 10 years and established guidelines to clarify the indications and transplant modalities in this setting. This manuscript reports on general considerations regarding allo-HCT for lymphoma and elaborates on the use of alternative donors in this setting. Journal: Bulletin du cancer. Year: 2017.

Abstract: Cancer is a lethal disease that drew the entire world over the past decades. Currently, numerous researches focused on these cancer treatments. Most familiar among them is the targeted therapy; a customized treatment type depends on the cancer drug targets. Further, the selection of targets is a quite sensitive task. The computational approaches are lagging in this field. This paper is intended to propose an optimized multi-functional score-based co-clustering with MapReduce (MR-CoC<sub>opt</sub>) approach for drug target module mining with optimal functional score set selection. This approach uses biological functional measures for co-clustering, MapReduce framework for handling redundant modules and complex protein interaction network (PIN), and non-swarm intelligence algorithm-bladderworts suction for optimal functional score set selection. It extracts the cancer-specific drug target modules in protein interaction networks. The protein complex coverage of the results is compared with the existing approach. The biological significance of the results is analyzed for the presence of cancer drug targets and drug target characteristics. From these results, novel cancer drug target modules are suggested for the targeted therapy and the active pharmaceutical drugs for these modules are also highlighted.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Ex-vivo drug screening of surgically resected glioma stem cells to replace murine avatars and provide personalise cancer therapy for glioblastoma patients.. Abstract: With diminishing returns and high clinical failure rates from traditional preclinical and animal-based drug discovery strategies, more emphasis is being placed on alternative drug discovery platforms. <i>Ex vivo</i> approaches represent a departure from both more traditional preclinical animal-based models and clinical-based strategies and aim to address intra-tumoural and inter-patient variability at an earlier stage of drug discovery. Additionally, these approaches could also offer precise treatment stratification for patients within a week of tumour resection in order to direct tailored therapy. One tumour group that could significantly benefit from such <i>ex vivo</i> approaches are high-grade gliomas, which exhibit extensive heterogeneity, cellular plasticity and therapy-resistant glioma stem cell (GSC) niches. Historic use of murine-based preclinical models for these tumours has largely failed to generate new therapies, resulting in relatively stagnant and unacceptable survival rates of around 12-15 months post-diagnosis over the last 50 years. The near universal use of DNA damaging chemoradiotherapy after surgical resection within standard-of-care (SoC) therapy regimens provides an opportunity to improve current treatments if we can identify efficient drug combinations in preclinical models that better reflect the complex inter-/intra-tumour heterogeneity, GSC plasticity and inherent DNA damage resistance mechanisms. We have therefore developed and optimised a high-throughput <i>ex vivo</i> drug screening platform; GliExP, which maintains GSC populations using immediately dissociated fresh surgical tissue. As a proof-of-concept for GliExP, we have optimised SoC therapy responses and screened 30+ small molecule therapeutics and preclinical compounds against tumours from 18 different patients, including multi-region spatial heterogeneity sampling from several individual tumours. Our data therefore provides a strong basis to build upon GliExP to incorporate combination-based oncology therapeutics in tandem with SoC therapies as an important preclinical alternative to murine models (reduction and replacement) to triage experimental therapeutics for clinical translation and deliver rapid identification of effective treatment strategies for individual gliomas.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: SALL4, the missing link between stem cells, development and cancer.. Abstract: There is a growing body of evidence supporting that cancer cells share many similarities with embryonic stem cells (ESCs). For example, aggressive cancers and ESCs share a common gene expression signature that includes hundreds of genes. Since ESC genes are not present in most adult tissues, they could be ideal candidate targets for cancer-specific diagnosis and treatment. This is an exciting cancer-targeting model. The major hurdle to test this model is to identify the key factors/pathway(s) within ESCs that are responsible for the cancer phenotype. SALL4 is one of few genes that can establish this link. The first publication of SALL4 is on its mutation in a human inherited disorder with multiple developmental defects. Since then, over 300 papers have been published on various aspects of this gene in stem cells, development, and cancers. This review aims to summarize our current knowledge of SALL4, including a SALL4-based approach to classify and target cancers. Many questions about this important gene still remain unanswered, specifically, on how this gene regulates cell fates at a molecular level. Understanding SALL4's molecular functions will allow development of specific targeted approaches in the future. Journal: Gene. Year: 2016. Authors: Tatetsu H, Kong NR, Chong G, Amabile G, Tenen DG.

Abstract: Genome-scale studies focusing on molecular profiling of cancers across tissue types have revealed a plethora of aberrations across the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic scales. The significant molecular heterogeneity across individual tumors even within the same tissue context complicates decoding the key etiologic mechanisms of this disease. Furthermore, it is increasingly likely that biologic mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of cancer involve multiple molecular entities interacting across functional scales. This has motivated the development of computational approaches that integrate molecular measurements with prior biological knowledge in increasingly intricate ways to enable the discovery of driver genomic aberrations across cancers. Here, we review diverse methodological approaches that have powered significant advances in our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of cancer at the cohort and at the individual tumor scales. We outline the key advances and challenges in the computational discovery of cancer mechanisms while motivating the development of systems biology approaches to comprehensively decode the biologic drivers of this complex disease.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: MicroRNAs as therapeutic targets in chemoresistance.. Abstract: Despite substantial progress in understanding the cancer signaling network, effective therapies remain scarce due to insufficient disruption of oncogenic pathways, drug resistance and drug-induced toxicity. New and more creative approaches are therefore required for the treatment of cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by sequence-selective targeting of mRNAs, leading to a translational repression or mRNA degradation. Experimental evidence demonstrates that dysregulation of specific miRNAs leads to drug resistance in different cancers and correction of these miRNAs using miRNA mimics or antagomiRs can normalize the gene regulatory network and signaling pathways and sensitize cancerous cells to chemotherapy. Therefore, miRNA-based gene therapy provides an attractive anti-tumor approach for integrated cancer therapy. Here, we will discuss the involvement of microRNAs in chemotherapy resistance and focus on recent advancements in the development and delivery of miRNA-based cancer therapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The Link of mRNA and rRNA Transcription by PUF60/FIR through TFIIH/P62 as a Novel Therapeutic Target for Cancer.. Abstract: The interaction between mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription in cancer remains unclear. RNAP I and II possess a common N-terminal tail (NTT), RNA polymerase subunit RPB6, which interacts with P62 of transcription factor (TF) IIH, and is a common target for the link between mRNA and rRNA transcription. The mRNAs and rRNAs affected by FUBP1-interacting repressor (FIR) were assessed via RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis. An FIR, a c-myc transcriptional repressor, and its splicing form FIR\u0394exon2 were examined to interact with P62. Protein interaction was investigated via isothermal titration calorimetry measurements. FIR was found to contain a highly conserved region homologous to RPB6 that interacts with P62. FIR\u0394exon2 competed with FIR for P62 binding and coactivated transcription of mRNAs and rRNAs. Low-molecular-weight chemical compounds that bind to FIR and FIR\u0394exon2 were screened for cancer treatment. A low-molecular-weight chemical, BK697, which interacts with FIR\u0394exon2, inhibited tumor cell growth with rRNA suppression. In this study, a novel coactivation pathway for cancer-related mRNA and rRNA transcription through TFIIH/P62 by FIR\u0394exon2 was proposed. Direct evidence in X-ray crystallography is required in further studies to show the conformational difference between FIR and FIR\u0394exon2 that affects the P62-RBP6 interaction.

Abstract: Intratumor heterogeneity is a common characteristic across diverse cancer types and presents challenges to current standards of treatment. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing and imaging technologies provide opportunities to identify and characterize these aspects of heterogeneity. Notably, transcriptomic profiling at a single-cell resolution enables quantitative measurements of the molecular activity that underlies the phenotypic diversity of cells within a tumor. Such high-dimensional data require computational analysis to extract relevant biological insights about the cell types and states that drive cancer development, pathogenesis, and clinical outcomes. In this review, we highlight emerging themes in the computational analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data and their applications to cancer research. We focus on downstream analytical challenges relevant to cancer research, including how to computationally perform unified analysis across many patients and disease states, distinguish neoplastic from nonneoplastic cells, infer communication with the tumor microenvironment, and delineate tumoral and microenvironmental evolution with trajectory and RNA velocity analysis. We include discussions of challenges and opportunities for future computational methodological advancements necessary to realize the translational potential of single-cell transcriptomic profiling in cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: VDAC1-Based Peptides as Potential Modulators of VDAC1 Interactions with Its Partners and as a Therapeutic for Cancer, NASH, and Diabetes.. Abstract: This review presents current knowledge related to the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) as a multi-functional mitochondrial protein that acts in regulating both cell life and death. The location of VDAC1 at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) allows control of metabolic cross-talk between the mitochondria and the rest of the cell, and also enables its interaction with proteins that are involved in metabolic, cell death, and survival pathways. VDAC1's interactions with over 150 proteins can mediate and regulate the integration of mitochondrial functions with cellular activities. To target these protein-protein interactions, VDAC1-derived peptides have been developed. This review focuses specifically on cell-penetrating VDAC1-based peptides that were developed and used as a \"decoy\" to compete with VDAC1 for its VDAC1-interacting proteins. These peptides interfere with VDAC1 interactions, for example, with metabolism-associated proteins such as hexokinase (HK), or with anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. These and other VDAC1-interacting proteins are highly expressed in many cancers. The VDAC1-based peptides in cells in culture selectively affect cancerous, but not non-cancerous cells, inducing cell death in a variety of cancers, regardless of the cancer origin or genetics. They inhibit cell energy production, eliminate cancer stem cells, and act very rapidly and at low micro-molar concentrations. The activity of these peptides has been validated in several mouse cancer models of glioblastoma, lung, and breast cancers. Their anti-cancer activity involves a multi-pronged attack targeting the hallmarks of cancer. They were also found to be effective in treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes mellitus. Thus, VDAC1-based peptides, by targeting VDAC1-interacting proteins, offer an affordable and innovative new conceptual therapeutic paradigm that can potentially overcome heterogeneity, chemoresistance, and invasive metastatic formation.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults. This study aimed to identify significant prognostic biomarkers related to GBM. We collected 3 GBM and 3 healthy human brain samples for transcriptome and proteomic sequencing analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between GBM and control samples were identified using the edge R package in R. Functional enrichment analyses, prediction of long noncoding RNA target genes, and protein-protein interaction network analyses were performed. Subsequently, transcriptomic and proteomic association analyses, validation using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and survival and prognostic analyses were conducted. Then the hub genes directly related to GBM were screened. Finally, the expression of key genes was verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Totally, 1140 transcripts and 503 proteins were significantly up- or down-regulated. A total of 25 genes were upregulated and 62 were downregulated at both the transcriptome and proteome levels. Results from TCGA database showed that 84 of these 87 genes matched with transcriptome sequencing results. A Cox regression analysis suggested that Fibronectin 1(<i>FN1</i>) was a prognostic risk factor. The qPCR results showed that <i>FN1</i> was significantly upregulated in GBM samples. <i>FN1</i> may play a role in GBM progression through ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. <i>FN1</i> may be considered as a prognostic biomarkers related to GBM.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by genetic aberrations that also govern the prognosis of patients and guide risk-adapted and targeted therapy. Genetic aberrations in AML are structurally diverse and currently detected by different diagnostic assays. This study sought to establish whole transcriptome RNA sequencing as single, comprehensive, and flexible platform for AML diagnostics. We developed HAMLET (Human AML Expedited Transcriptomics) as bioinformatics pipeline for simultaneous detection of fusion genes, small variants, tandem duplications, and gene expression with all information assembled in an annotated, user-friendly output file. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing was performed on 100 AML cases and HAMLET results were validated by reference assays and targeted resequencing. The data showed that HAMLET accurately detected all fusion genes and overexpression of EVI1 irrespective of 3q26 aberrations. In addition, small variants in 13 genes that are often mutated in AML were called with 99.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and tandem duplications in FLT3 and KMT2A were detected by a novel algorithm based on soft-clipped reads with 100% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity. In conclusion, HAMLET has the potential to provide accurate comprehensive diagnostic information relevant for AML classification, risk assessment and targeted therapy on a single technology platform.

Abstract: The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway plays a key role in the systemic inflammatory response in many cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). This study evaluated the addition of ruxolitinib, a potent JAK1/2 inhibitor, to regorafenib in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic CRC. In this two-part, multicenter, phase 2 study, eligible adult patients had metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2; received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (if no contraindication); and if KRAS wild-type (and no contraindication), an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy; and progressed following the last administration of approved therapy. Patients who received previous treatment with regorafenib, had an established cardiac or gastrointestinal disease, or had an active infection requiring treatment were excluded. The study was conducted in 95 sites in North America, European Union, Asia Pacific, and Israel. After an open-label, safety run-in phase (part 1; ruxolitinib 20\u00a0mg twice daily [BID] plus regorafenib 160\u00a0mg once daily [QD]), the double-blind, randomized phase (part 2) was conducted wherein patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ruxolitinib 15\u00a0mg BID plus regorafenib 160\u00a0mg QD [ruxolitinib group] or placebo plus regorafenib 160\u00a0mg QD [placebo group]. Part 2 included substudy 1 (patients with high systemic inflammation, ie, C-reactive protein [CRP] >10\u00a0mg/L) and substudy 2 (patients with low systemic inflammation, ie, CRP \u226410\u00a0mg/L); the primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The study was terminated early; substudy 1 was terminated for futility at interim analysis and substudy 2 was terminated per sponsor decision. Ruxolitinib 20\u00a0mg BID was well tolerated in the safety run-in (n\u00a0=\u00a011). Overall, 396 patients were randomized (substudy 1: n\u00a0=\u00a0175 [ruxolitinib group, n\u00a0=\u00a087; placebo group, n\u00a0=\u00a088]; substudy 2: n\u00a0=\u00a0221 [ruxolitinib group, n\u00a0=\u00a0110; placebo group, n\u00a0=\u00a0111]). There was no significant difference in OS or progression-free survival (PFS) between treatments in substudy 1 (OS: hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a01.040 [95% confidence interval: 0.725-1.492]; PFS: HR\u00a0=\u00a01.004 [0.724-1.391]) and substudy 2 (OS: HR\u00a0=\u00a00.767 [0.478-1.231]; PFS: HR\u00a0=\u00a00.787 [0.576-1.074]). The most common hematologic adverse event was anemia. No new safety signals with ruxolitinib were identified. Although addition of ruxolitinib to regorafenib did not show increased safety concerns in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic CRC, this combination did not improve OS/PFS vs. regorafenib plus placebo.

Abstract: Therapies targeting HER2 have improved clinical outcomes in HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, and are emerging as potential treatments for HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer. MyPathway evaluates the activity of targeted therapies in non-indicated tumour types with potentially predictive molecular alterations. We aimed to assess the activity of pertuzumab and trastuzumab in patients with HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer. MyPathway is an ongoing, phase 2a, multiple basket study. Patients in this subset analysis were aged 18 years or older and had treatment-refractory, histologically confirmed HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer with measurable or evaluable disease and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 2 or less, enrolled from 25 hospitals or clinics in 16 states of the USA. Patients received pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg every 3 weeks, intravenously) and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, intravenously). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response based on investigator-reported tumour responses. Analyses were done per protocol. This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02091141. Between Oct 20, 2014, and June 22, 2017, 57 patients with HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer were enrolled in the MyPathway study and deemed eligible for inclusionin this cohort analysis. Among these 57 evaluable patients, as of Aug 1, 2017, one (2%) patient had a complete response and 17 (30%) had partial responses; thus overall 18 of 57 patients achieved an objective response (32%, 95% CI 20-45). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea (19 [33%] of 57 patients), fatigue (18 [32%] patients), and nausea (17 [30%] patients). Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were recorded in 21 (37%) of 57 patients, most commonly hypokalaemia and abdominal pain (each three [5%] patients). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in ten (18%) patients and two (4%) of these adverse events (ie, chills and infusion-related reaction) were considered treatment related. There were no treatment-related deaths. Dual HER2-targeted therapy with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab is well tolerated and could represent a therapeutic opportunity for patients with heavily pretreated, HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer.

Initially, use of these therapies required biomarker detection in a specific tumor type. Recently, regulatory agencies have approved highly active biomarker-based, tumor-agnostic therapies, which are crucial for the unmet needs of patients with rare cancer, including children with cancer, because an infrequent biomarker in an already rare cancer represents a prohibitive clinical trial accrual barrier. There are also now several 'ag(e)nostic' precision oncology therapies - agnostic to tumor type and also approved for all ages. In this opinion, we provide historical context for the precision oncology field and contend that, moving forward, ag(e)nostic precision oncology approvals should be the norm for this class of therapeutics rather than an exception to the rule.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Locking the gates of immortality: targeting alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathways.. Abstract: Telomere maintenance is essential for the unlimited proliferation of cancer cells. While most cancers reactivate telomerase to preserve telomeres, approximately 10-15% utilize the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a telomerase-independent mechanism driven by homologous recombination. ALT is primarily observed in sarcomas and neuroepithelial tumors and it is characterized by hallmarks such as heterogeneous telomere lengths, the presence of ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), extrachromosomal telomeric repeats (ECTRs), and elevated replication stress. This review has a threefold aim: (1) to examine the mechanisms of ALT activation, (2) to highlight existing therapeutic interventions targeting ALT components and telosomic complexes, and, (3) to pinpoint potential molecular targets for novel anticancer treatments. Therapeutic strategies focus on disrupting APBs, stabilizing G-quadruplex structures, and inhibiting replication stress proteins such as FANCM and SMARCAL1. Emerging evidence highlights the role of shelterin proteins like TRF1 and TRF2, chromatin remodeling factors such as ATRX and DAXX, and the dysregulated cGAS-STING pathway in facilitating ALT activity. Moreover, the inhibitory role of RAP1-SUN1 protein interactions in telomere recombination provides a novel therapeutic avenue. Recent advances have elucidated the intricate balance of replication stress, DNA damage response, and recombination in ALT regulation. These insights can help overcome challenges posed by ALT\u2009+\u2009cancers, including their ability to transition from telomerase-dependent states. Targeting ALT-specific vulnerabilities offers a promising direction for developing innovative therapies that exploit the unique biology of ALT-driven tumors.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Therapeutics targeting the metastatic breast cancer bone microenvironment.. Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) patient prognosis has improved over the past 2 decades with a 99% 5-year survival rate for localized BC, yet metastatic breast cancer (mBC) continues to cause high mortality with a 5-year survival rate of 29%. Approximately 70% of BC metastases occur in the bone, with estrogen receptor (ER) positive BC exhibiting a particular affinity to bone. Once BC metastasizes to the bone, curative treatments are not available, thus therapeutic approaches are focused on palliative care and prevention of skeletal related events while attempting to slow metastatic progression. Recent advances in molecularly targeted agents have enhanced the repertoire of options for mBC patients, but immunotherapies have not yet been fully translated to ER+ tumors. Thus mBC patients have yet to fully benefit from novel therapies, which is currently obstructing patient survival. The unique tumor microenvironment (TME) of mBC in bone offers an array of targets for therapeutic development. The mBC TME in bone presents a predominantly osteolytic or destructive bone pathology, where bone mineral loss is driven by increased resorption of bone by osteoclasts. We discuss therapeutics targeting the mBC cells, bone cells, immune cells, and other stromal cells in the bone TME, including treatments that are currently used in the clinic, under development, and are potential new avenues for therapy. Therapeutic advancements targeting the TME of mBC in bone could be applied to other bone-resident cancers, including myeloma and metastatic prostate cancer bone lesions. These precision oncology approaches to mBC treatment will improve the quality of life and clinical outcomes of patients with mBC bone lesions. Journal: Pharmacology & therapeutics. Year: 2022.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Prognostic biomarkers for prediction of recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma: current status and future prospects.. Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide, with region specific etiologies. Despite improvements made in the diagnosis of HCC, the prognosis of HCC patients remains poor due to the high recurrence rate of HCC. There is an urgent need for development of prognostic biomarkers to predict the risk of recurrence in HCC patients after \"curative\" treatment. Such stratification may aid in patient management and development of personalized medicine for HCC treatment. Omics based studies facilitate the study of global changes in biomolecules in a disease in a high throughput manner, and hence are well poised to understand the complex changes which led to HCC recurrence. The quantitative nature of data obtained from omics based studies allow for development of prognostic biomarkers based on changes in gene, protein and metabolite expression. In this review, we surveyed the application of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics in the study of HCC recurrence. We summarised the data in the literature from these three fields of studies that claimed to be prognostic for HCC recurrence. We critiqued on the limitations of each area of research and the challenges faced in translating the research results for clinical application in predicting HCC recurrence.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cancer stem cells: relevance to clinical transplantation.. Abstract: Despite blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) being arguably the most active modality against hematologic malignancies, relapses remain the major reason for failure. Many cancers have now been shown to harbor cells that are phenotypically and biologically similar to normal cells with self-renewal capacity; these so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs) typically constitute only a small fraction of the total tumor burden, but are hypothesized to be responsible for relapse after conventional-dose therapy. Here, we review whether CSCs may have relevance to BMT. CSCs appear to be relatively resistant to standard anticancer therapies in vitro. The often-dramatic responses induced by chemotherapy in most hematologic malignancies are likely a consequence of their impressive activity against the bulk tumor cells. Although the clinical importance of CSCs remains unproven, new evidence suggests that the limited durability of many of these responses reflect resistant CSCs. It is possible that CSCs are also relatively resistant to both high-dose myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic graft-versus-tumor effects. Data on the ability of most hematologic CSCs to circulate even early in the natural history of a malignancy also raises concerns about contamination of autografts contributing to relapse. Emerging data for the first time suggest CSCs may be responsible for relapse, even after BMT. However, BMT may be a particularly compelling setting to test CSC-targeting strategies because it provides the most effective clinical debulking of hematologic malignancies, and because CSC-targeting strategies may also enhance allogeneic antitumor immunity.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Advances in the treatment of relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia.. Abstract: The presence of the characteristic fusion transcript gene, promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARalpha), provided hematologists with a rationale for the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Multiple studies have established that combination of ATRA and chemotherapy in newly diagnosed patients has increased the cure rate to 70% from 35% in patients treated with chemotherapy alone. However, still about 30% of the patients relapse and are often resistant to ATRA retreatment. Consequently, a number of novel agents that include several differentiation agents and monoclonal antibodies have been studied to provide improved outcomes for patients with APL who have relapsed. In particular, arsenic trioxide has shown great promise for the induction, consolidation, and maintenance of complete remission in relapsed patients with APL. The unique mechanisms of action by which arsenic trioxide exerts its effects are complementary to those of ATRA, potentially allowing for combination therapies with additive or even synergistic results. Within this context autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantations are also considered in second or subsequent relapse, especially after arsenic trioxide-induced complete remission in relapsing patients. Furthermore, molecular monitoring for the PML-RARalpha fusion protein permits prompt intervention for early molecular relapse of APL before clinical relapse, ultimately improving chances of prolonged remission.

At the time of ABMT, 10 were chemosensitive, four were chemoresistant, and 10 were absolutely refractory to platinum. Disease status (no. patients) at transplant: primary refractory disease (six), first relapse (10), second relapse (eight), third relapse (five). Fifteen (52%) received both transplants. Treatment-related mortality was 10%. Best response after ABMT included: two CR, one CR surgically NED, five PR, three PR surgically NED, seven SD, and eight PD. Eight (28%) patients are continuously progression-free a median 60 months (range, 31-93) from first ABMT. Three seminoma patients remain progression-free. Of five long-term NSGCT survivors, four were treated in first relapse with platinum-sensitive disease. Eighteen relapses occurred a median of 4 months after ABMT I (two late relapses at 28 and 44 months). The median PFS and OS for the whole group are 4 and 14 months, respectively. Patients with relapsed/ refractory testicular cancer benefit most from ABMT if they have platinum-sensitive disease in first relapse. Patients who do poorly despite ABMT have a mediastinal primary site, true cisplatin-refractory disease, disease progression prior to ABMT, and/or markedly elevated betaHCG at ABMT. New treatment modalities are needed for the latter group. Journal: Bone marrow transplantation. Year: 2001. Authors: Ayash LJ, Clarke M, Silver SM, Braun T, Uberti J.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Novel systems biology experimental pipeline reveals matairesinol's antimetastatic potential in prostate cancer: an integrated approach of network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and experimental validation.. Abstract: Matairesinol (MAT), a plant lignan renowned for its anticancer properties in hormone-sensitive cancers like breast and prostate cancers, presents a promising yet underexplored avenue in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). To elucidate its specific therapeutic targets and mechanisms, our study adopted an integrative approach, amalgamating network pharmacology (NP), bioinformatics, GeneMANIA-based functional association (GMFA), and experimental validation. By mining online databases, we identified 27 common targets of mPC and MAT, constructing a MAT-mPC protein-protein interaction network via STRING and pinpointing 11 hub targets such as EGFR, AKT1, ERBB2, MET, IGF1, CASP3, HSP90AA1, HIF1A, MMP2, HGF, and MMP9 with CytoHuba. Utilizing DAVID, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis highlighted metastasis-related processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, positive regulation of cell migration, and key Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including cancer, prostate cancer, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK signaling, while the web resources such as UALCAN and GEPIA2 affirmed the clinical significance of the top 11 hub targets in mPC patient survival analysis and gene expression patterns. Our innovative GMFA enrichment method further enriched network pharmacology findings. Molecular docking analyses demonstrated substantial interactions between MAT and 11 hub targets. Simulation studies confirmed the stable interactions of MAT with selected targets. Experimental validation in PC3 cells, employing quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR and various cell-based assays, corroborated MAT's antimetastatic effects on mPC. Thus, this exhaustive NP analysis, complemented by GMFA, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental validations, underscores MAT's multifaceted role in targeting mPC through diverse therapeutic avenues. Nevertheless, comprehensive in vitro validation is imperative to solidify these findings. Journal: Briefings in bioinformatics. Year: 2024. Authors: Rajadnya R, Sharma N, Mahajan A, Ulhe A, Patil R.

Abstract: The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) erlotinib improves survival of lung cancer as second- or third-line therapy. However, after an initial response, most patients will recur, particularly within the central nervous system. The present study reports the case of a 27-yr-old nonsmoking male presenting with a metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR exon 19 deletion, associated with sensitivity to EGFR-TKI. Gefitinib, followed by chemotherapy and finally erlotinib resulted in prolonged disease control, until multiple liver metastases were detected. After stopping EGFR-TKI, brain metastases with carcinomatous meningitis were diagnosed. A secondary T790M mutation, associated with resistance to EGFR-TKI, was found on the liver biopsy but not in the cerebrospinal fluid. Erlotinib was reintroduced and allowed a quick neurological improvement, even though the extra-cranial disease remained resistant to erlotinib. The present report underscores the interest of molecular monitoring in lung cancer. Persistent cerebral tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitivity should be considered in patients presenting with an early central nervous system relapse after stopping epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, even with a T790M-resistant mutation in noncerebral metastases. Questions remain concerning the selection of sub-clones during epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, which could differ according to metastatic sites, especially in the central nervous system.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Interactive enhancer hubs (iHUBs) mediate transcriptional reprogramming and adaptive resistance in pancreatic cancer.. Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) displays a remarkable propensity towards therapy resistance. However, molecular epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms enabling this are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to identify novel mechanistic approaches to overcome or prevent resistance in PDAC. We used in vitro and in vivo models of resistant PDAC and integrated epigenomic, transcriptomic, nascent RNA and chromatin topology data. We identified a JunD-driven subgroup of enhancers, called interactive hubs (iHUBs), which mediate transcriptional reprogramming and chemoresistance in PDAC. iHUBs display characteristics typical for active enhancers (H3K27ac enrichment) in both therapy sensitive and resistant states but exhibit increased interactions and production of enhancer RNA (eRNA) in the resistant state. Notably, deletion of individual iHUBs was sufficient to decrease transcription of target genes and sensitise resistant cells to chemotherapy. Overlapping motif analysis and transcriptional profiling identified the activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor JunD as a master transcription factor of these enhancers. JunD depletion decreased iHUB interaction frequency and transcription of target genes. Moreover, targeting either eRNA production or signaling pathways upstream of iHUB activation using clinically tested small molecule inhibitors decreased eRNA production and interaction frequency, and restored chemotherapy responsiveness in vitro and in vivo. Representative iHUB target genes were found to be more expressed in patients with poor response to chemotherapy compared with responsive patients. Our findings identify an important role for a subgroup of highly connected enhancers (iHUBs) in regulating chemotherapy response and demonstrate targetability in sensitisation to chemotherapy.

Abstract: There are increasing studies aimed to reveal genomic hallmarks predictive of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment response, which generated a large number of data and provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify response-related features and evaluate their robustness across cohorts. However, those valuable data sets are not easily accessible to the research community. To take full advantage of existing large-scale immuno-genomic profiles, we developed Immu-Mela (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/database/Immu-Mela/), a multidimensional immuno-genomic portal that provides interactive exploration of associations between ICB responsiveness and multi-omics features in melanoma, including genetic, transcriptomics, immune cells, and single-cell populations. Immu-Mela also enables integrative analysis of any two genomic features. We demonstrated the value of Immu-Mela by identifying known and novel genomic features associated with ICB response. In addition, Immu-Mela allows users to upload their data sets (unrestricted to any cancer types) and co-analyze with existing data to identify and validate signatures of interest. Immu-Mela reduces barriers between researchers and complex genomic data, facilitating discoveries in cancer immunotherapy. Journal: Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao. Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cell of Origin Influences Pancreatic Cancer Subtype.. Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 9%. An improved understanding of PDAC initiation and progression is paramount for discovering strategies to better detect and combat this disease. Although transcriptomic analyses have uncovered distinct molecular subtypes of human PDAC, the factors that influence subtype development remain unclear. Here, we interrogate the impact of cell of origin and different <i>Trp53</i> alleles on tumor evolution, using a panel of tractable genetically engineered mouse models. Oncogenic KRAS expression, coupled with <i>Trp53</i> deletion or point mutation, drives PDAC from both acinar and ductal cells. Gene-expression analysis reveals further that ductal cell-derived and acinar cell-derived tumor signatures are enriched in basal-like and classical subtypes of human PDAC, respectively. These findings highlight cell of origin as one factor that influences PDAC molecular subtypes and provide insight into the fundamental impact that the very earliest events in carcinogenesis can have on cancer evolution. SIGNIFICANCE: Although human PDAC has been classified into different molecular subtypes, the etiology of these distinct subtypes remains unclear. Using mouse genetics, we reveal that cell of origin is an important determinant of PDAC molecular subtype. Deciphering the biology underlying pancreatic cancer subtypes may reveal meaningful distinctions that could improve clinical intervention.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 521</i>.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Identifying common transcriptome signatures of cancer by interpreting deep learning models.. Abstract: Cancer is a set of diseases characterized by unchecked cell proliferation and invasion of surrounding tissues. The many genes that have been genetically associated with cancer or shown to directly contribute to oncogenesis vary widely between tumor types, but common gene signatures that relate to core cancer pathways have also been identified. It is not clear, however, whether there exist additional sets of genes or transcriptomic features that are less well known in cancer biology but that are also commonly deregulated across several cancer types. Here, we agnostically identify transcriptomic features that are commonly shared between cancer types using 13,461 RNA-seq samples from 19 normal tissue types and 18 solid tumor types to train three feed-forward neural networks, based either on protein-coding gene expression, lncRNA expression, or splice junction use, to distinguish between normal and tumor samples. All three models recognize transcriptome signatures that are consistent across tumors. Analysis of attribution values extracted from our models reveals that genes that are commonly altered in cancer by expression or splicing variations are under strong evolutionary and selective constraints. Importantly, we find that genes composing our cancer transcriptome signatures are not frequently affected by mutations or genomic alterations and that their functions differ widely from the genes genetically associated with cancer. Our results highlighted that deregulation of RNA-processing genes and aberrant splicing are pervasive features on which core cancer pathways might converge across a large array of solid tumor types.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Epigenome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome profiling of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer: Uncovering new molecular markers.. Abstract: It has become increasingly important to identify molecular markers for accurately diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa) stages between localized PCa (LPC) and locally advanced PCa (LAPC). However, there is a lack of profiling both epigenome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome for the same patients with PCa at different stages. This study aims to identify epitranscriptomic biomarkers screened in the peri-prostatic (PP) adipose tissue for predicting LPC and LAPC. We profiled gene expression and DNA methylation of 10 PCa patients' PP adipose tissue (4 LPC and 6 LAPC). Differential analysis was used to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and expressed genes. An integrative analysis of the microarray gene expression profiles and DNA methylation profiles was conducted using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) between each studied gene and the CpG sites in their promoter region. This epitranscriptomic signature was constructed by combining the association and differential analyses. The signature was then refined using the genetic mutation data of >1500 primary PCa and metastasis PCa samples from 4 different studies. We determined genes that were the most significantly affected by mutations. Machine learning models were built to evaluate the classification ability of the identified signature using the gene expression profiles from three external cohorts. From the LASSO-based association analysis, we identified 56 genes presenting significant anti-correlation between the expression level and the methylation level of at least one CpG site in the promoter region (p-value<5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-8</sup>). From the differential analysis, we detected 16,405 downregulated genes and 9485 genes containing at least one hypermethylated CpG site. We identified 30 genes that showed anti-correlation, down-regulation and hyper-methylation simultaneously. Using genetic mutation data, we determined that 6 of the 30 genes showed significant differences (adjusted p-value<0.05) in mutation frequencies between the primary PCa and metastasis PCa samples. The identified 30 genes performed well in distinguishing PCa patients with metastasis from PCa patient without metastasis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)\u00a0=\u00a00.81). The gene signature also performed well in distinguishing PCa patients with high risk of progression from PCa patients with low risk of progression (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.88). We established an integrative framework to identify differentially expressed genes with an aberrant methylation pattern on PP adipose tissue that may represent novel candidate molecular markers for distinguishing between LPC and LAPC.

Abstract: T cells genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have proven - and impressive - therapeutic activity in patients with certain subtypes of B cell leukaemia or lymphoma, with promising efficacy also demonstrated in patients with multiple myeloma. Nevertheless, various barriers restrict the efficacy and/or prevent the widespread use of CAR T cell therapies in these patients as well as in those with other cancers, particularly solid tumours. Key challenges relating to CAR T cells include severe toxicities, restricted trafficking to, infiltration into and activation within tumours, suboptimal persistence in vivo, antigen escape and heterogeneity, and manufacturing issues. The evolution of CAR designs beyond the conventional structures will be necessary to address these limitations and to expand the use of CAR T cells to a wider range of malignancies. Investigators are addressing the current obstacles with a wide range of engineering strategies in order to improve the safety, efficacy and applicability of this therapeutic modality. In this Review, we discuss the innovative designs of novel CAR T cell products that are being developed to increase and expand the clinical benefits of these treatments in patients with diverse cancers.

Abstract: The treatment of patients with advanced gynecologic malignancies remains challenging. Advancements in genomics have led to recognition and development of individualized therapeutic targets. This article reviews the current trends in precision medicine for treatment of gynecologic cancers. With the identification of the molecular aberrations inherent to gynecologic malignancies, we have discovered targetable mutations. Specific to ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers, potential therapeutic targets that have been identified and shown to have benefit include: hormonal therapies, anti-angiogenic agents, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), and immunotherapy. The adoption of targeted therapeutics for the treatment of gynecologic cancers has been gradual, but we have started to see the rapid employment of novel targeted agents into clinical trial development, leading to new treatment approvals. However, there are challenges to the universal precision medicine implementation, and future studies need to identify, discover, and validate robust biomarkers with strong prognostic/predictive capabilities.

Abstract: Chemo-refractory NHL has a very poor outcome; the addiction of RIT to salvage regiment pre ASCT had recently demonstrated promising results.We performed a retrospective sequential study to determine the feasibility of standard Zevalin with BEAM in high-risk relapse/refractory NHL. A matched cohort analysis with a group treated with standard BEAM without Zevalin was performed as secondary endpoint. Between October 2006 and January 2013, 37 NHL patients at high risk for progression or early (<\u20091\u00a0year) or multiple relapses were treated with Z-BEAM and ASCT after R-DHAP or R-ICE as salvage therapy. Clinical characteristics were 19 refractory and 18 early or multiple relapse; 16 patients received 1, and 21 had 2 or more previous rituximab-containing chemotherapy. At the end of treatment, response was CR 22 (59%), PR 10 (27%), PD 4 (11%), and toxic death (TD) 1 (3%). With a median follow up of 61\u00a0months, 3-year PFS was 61% and OS 61%. Fifteen patients died, 12 of lymphoma. Comparison with 21 treated with BEAM alone showed a numerical higher 3-yr PFS rate in favor of Z-BEAM but not statistically significant (57 vs 48%). With the limitation of the small sample subgroup analysis, a significant benefit was observed in relapsed patients for PFS (78% Z-BEAM vs 22% BEAM p\u2009=\u20090.016) and OS (83% Z-BEAM vs 22% BEAM p\u2009=\u20090.001). In relapsed/refractory high-risk NHL, Z-BEAM+ASCT is able to achieve a good ORR. Three-year PFS is promising for early relapsed patients but is not satisfactory for those with refractory disease.

Abstract: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade for the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC (n\u2009=\u200928) and NSCLC (n\u2009=\u2009177) patients who received treatment at Hunan Cancer Hospital between June 1, 2019, and July 1, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. Progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment responses were compared among patients who received combination therapy of anlotinib plus PD-1 inhibitor, or monotherapy of either chemotherapy or PD-1 inhibitor. Independent prognostic factors were identified by Cox regression analysis. Patients with relapsed SCLC who received anlotinib plus PD-1 inhibitor as a\u2009\u2265 second-line therapy (n\u2009=\u200914) had a significantly longer PFS than those who received PD-1 inhibitor alone (n\u2009=\u200914, 5.0 vs. 3.0\u00a0months; P\u2009=\u20090.005). For patients with previously untreated wild-type NSCLC, the combination therapy in the first-line setting (n\u2009=\u20096) provided a marginally longer PFS than mono-chemotherapy (n\u2009=\u20096, 8.0 vs. 3.0\u00a0months; P\u2009=\u20090.075). For patients with relapsed NSCLC, the combination therapy in the\u2009 \u2265\u2009second-line setting (n\u2009=\u200962) resulted in significantly higher objective response rate (19.3 vs. 5.0 vs. 2.4%; P\u2009=\u20090.013) and longer PFS (8.0 vs. 2.0 vs. 2.0\u00a0months; P\u2009<0.001) as compared to monotherapy of either chemotherapy (n\u2009=\u200941) or PD-1 inhibitor (n\u2009=\u200962). Anlotinib and PD-1 blockade combination therapy was an independent predictive factor of longer PFS (P\u2009<0.001). The combination of anlotinib and PD-1 inhibitor has promising efficacy and manageable toxicity as a second- or later-line treatment of relapsed NSCLC and possibly for relapsed SCLC.

Numerous efforts have been devoted to studying the mechanisms of glioma genesis and identifying biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. To help further investigations, we present a comprehensive database named GliomaDB. GliomaDB includes 21,086 samples from 4303 patients and integrates genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, clinical, and gene-drug association data regarding glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and low-grade glioma (LGG) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and PharmGKB. GliomaDB offers a user-friendly interface for two main types of functionalities. The first comprises queries of (i) somatic mutations, (ii) gene expression, (iii) microRNA (miRNA) expression, and (iv) DNA methylation. In addition, queries can be executed at the gene, region, and base level. Second, GliomaDB allows users to perform survival analysis, coexpression network visualization, multi-omics data visualization, and targeted drug recommendations based on personalized variations. GliomaDB bridges the gap between glioma genomics big data and the delivery of integrated information for end users, thus enabling both researchers and clinicians to effectively use publicly available data and empowering the progression of precision medicine in glioma.

Abstract: Multiple large-scale genomic profiling efforts have been undertaken in osteosarcoma to define the genomic drivers of tumorigenesis, therapeutic response, and disease recurrence. The spatial and temporal intratumor heterogeneity could also play a role in promoting tumor growth and treatment resistance. We conducted longitudinal whole-genome sequencing of 37 tumor samples from 8 patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. Each patient had at least one sample from a primary site and a metastatic or relapse site. Subclonal copy-number alterations were identified in all patients except one. In 5 patients, subclones from the primary tumor emerged and dominated at subsequent relapses. MYC gain/amplification was enriched in the treatment-resistant clones in 6 of 7 patients with multiple clones. Amplifications in other potential driver genes, such as CCNE1, RAD21, VEGFA, and IGF1R, were also observed in the resistant copy-number clones. A chromosomal duplication timing analysis revealed that complex genomic rearrangements typically occurred prior to diagnosis, supporting a macroevolutionary model of evolution, where a large number of genomic aberrations are acquired over a short period of time followed by clonal selection, as opposed to ongoing evolution. A mutational signature analysis of recurrent tumors revealed that homologous repair deficiency (HRD)-related SBS3 increases at each time point in patients with recurrent disease, suggesting that HRD continues to be an active mutagenic process after diagnosis. Overall, by examining the clonal relationships between temporally and spatially separated samples from patients with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma, this study sheds light on the intratumor heterogeneity and potential drivers of treatment resistance in this disease. The chemoresistant population in recurrent osteosarcoma is subclonal at diagnosis, emerges at the time of primary resection due to selective pressure from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and is characterized by unique oncogenic amplifications.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The critical protein interactions and structures that elicit growth deregulation in cancer and viral replication.. Abstract: One of the greatest challenges in biomedicine is to define the critical targets and network interactions that are subverted to elicit growth deregulation in human cells. Understanding and developing rational treatments for cancer requires a definition of the key molecular targets and how they interact to elicit the complex growth deregulation phenotype. Viral proteins provide discerning and powerful probes to understand both how cells work and how they can be manipulated using a minimal number of components. The small DNA viruses have evolved to target inherent weaknesses in cellular protein interaction networks to hijack the cellular DNA and protein replication machinery. In the battle to escape the inevitability of senescence and programmed cell death, cancers have converged on similar mechanisms, through the acquisition and selection of somatic mutations that drive unchecked cellular replication in tumors. Understanding the dynamic mechanisms through which a minimal number of viral proteins promote host cells to undergo unscheduled and pathological replication is a powerful strategy to identify critical targets that are also disrupted in cancer. Viruses can therefore be used as tools to probe the system-wide protein-protein interactions and structures that drive growth deregulation in human cells. Ultimately this can provide a path for developing system context-dependent therapeutics. This review will describe ongoing experimental approaches using viruses to study pathways deregulated in cancer, with a particular focus on viral cellular protein-protein interactions and structures.

Abstract: Favorable histology (FH) Wilms tumor (WT) is one of the most curable of all human cancers, yet a small minority of patients fail treatment. The underlying biological pathways that lead to therapy resistance are unknown. We report a case of initially unresectable, FH WT which revealed limited necrosis and persistent blastemal predominant histology following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Despite intensification of therapy and whole abdominal radiation, the patient relapsed and succumbed to her disease. In an effort to discover candidate drivers of drug resistance, whole exome sequencing and copy number analysis were performed on samples from all 3 tumor specimens. Sequencing results revealed outgrowth of clones with a dramatically different genetic landscape including dominant mutations that could explain therapy evasion, some of which have not been previously reported in WT. Our results implicate <i>PPM1D</i>, previously shown to be associated with drug resistance in other tumors, as the major driver of treatment failure.

Abstract: Given the inherent resistance to apoptosis that characterizes cancer, the targeting of alternative pathways is an attractive strategy to improve anti-tumor therapy. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is basally activated in many cancers, and the subsequent activation of autophagy represent novel cancer treatment targets. While these associated pathways are often protective and promote cell survival, when excessive, ER stress results in autophagic cell death. Therefore, depending on the circumstances, either inhibition or activation of ER stress and autophagy can improve cancer therapy. This review provides an update on how ER stress relates to autophagy, and how these associated pathways can serve dual functions to promote survival or cell death in cancer. Furthermore, it lays out a spectrum of potential pharmacological agents and combinatorial approaches that target these pathways to enhance tumor cell kill.

Abstract: A paradigm shift towards molecular-based, personalized cancer therapeutics has occurred in recent years and a number of targeted drugs have emerged. Various targeted therapies like erlotinib, trastuzumab, and cetuximab have been approved in lung, breast, and colon cancers, respectively. Numerous clinical trials involving targeted drugs in biliary tract cancers are currently in progress, though none have been approved for this disease. Biliary tract cancers are divided into separate entities both anatomically and in terms of pathogenesis but are grouped together in most trials given their rarity. Combination chemotherapy involving cisplatin and gemcitabine is the current standard of care in the metastatic setting. In this review, we will discuss the various molecular pathways implicated in biliary tract cancers and potential therapeutic targets. Journal: Current treatment options in oncology. Year: 2015.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Management of Metastatic Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Beyond CDK4/6 Inhibitors.. Abstract: Since the introduction of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) as the first-line treatment for metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer, there has been a significant expansion in the number of therapeutic options for subsequent lines of therapy. Many new agents are being studied, with potential for future regulatory approval. The increased number of therapeutic options raises questions about the optimal selection and sequencing of therapies for individual patients. These advances represent an important clinical challenge in this rapidly evolving field, given the introduction of new therapies targeting various pathways (alone or in combination) and new therapeutic classes being studied. Recently approved targeted therapies have demonstrated improvements in progression free survival (PFS) for patients whose cancer harbors mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway, ESR1, BRCA1/2, and/or PALB2. Data to support continuation of CDK4/6 inhibition after progression on a prior CDK4/6i remains mixed, though some studies suggest a subset of patients may benefit from this approach. Several agents with unique mechanisms of action have shown promise in data from early phase trials, and have the potential to enter the treatment lexicon in the coming years. Examples include CDK2- and CDK4-selective inhibitors, complete estrogen receptor antagonists (CERANs), proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), and next-generation PI3K pathway inhibitors. In this narrative review, we summarize the current and upcoming treatments for metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer after progression on a CDK4/6i plus ET, with a focus on the following: an overview of first-line regimens of CDK4/6i plus ET and observed mechanisms of resistance; currently approved second-line therapy options; and upcoming options currently under exploration in clinical trials. We focus primarily on new therapy classes that may offer therapeutic options beyond currently available treatments. Journal: Current oncology reports. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Targeting highly proliferating cells is an important issue for many types of aggressive tumors. Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is an essential protein that participates in a variety of processes of DNA metabolism, including DNA replication and repair, chromatin organization and transcription and sister chromatid cohesion. In addition, PCNA is involved in cell survival, and possibly in pathways of energy metabolism, such as glycolysis. Thus, the possibility of targeting this protein for chemotherapy against highly proliferating malignancies is under active investigation. Currently, approaches to treat cells with agents targeting PCNA rely on the use of small molecules or on peptides that either bind to PCNA, or act as a competitor of interacting partners. Here, we describe the status of the art in the development of agents targeting PCNA and discuss their application in different types of tumor cell lines and in animal model systems.

Abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), relying on hundreds of thousands of individuals, have revealed >200 genomic loci linked to metabolic disease (MD). Loss of insulin sensitivity (IS) is a key component of MD and we hypothesized that discovery of a robust IS transcriptome would help reveal the underlying genomic structure of MD. Using 1,012 human skeletal muscle samples, detailed physiology and a tissue-optimized approach for the quantification of coding (>18,000) and non-coding (>15,000) RNA (ncRNA), we identified 332 fasting IS-related genes (CORE-IS). Over 200 had a proven role in the biochemistry of insulin and/or metabolism or were located at GWAS MD loci.\u00a0Over\u00a050% of the CORE-IS genes responded to clinical treatment; 16 quantitatively tracking changes in IS across four independent studies (P = 0.0000053: negatively: AGL, G0S2, KPNA2, PGM2, RND3 and TSPAN9 and positively: ALDH6A1, DHTKD1, ECHDC3, MCCC1, OARD1, PCYT2, PRRX1, SGCG, SLC43A1 and SMIM8). A network of ncRNA positively related to IS and interacted with RNA coding for viral response proteins (P\u00a0< 1 \u00d7 10-48), while reduced amino acid catabolic gene expression occurred without a change in expression of oxidative-phosphorylation genes. We illustrate that combining in-depth physiological phenotyping with robust RNA profiling methods, identifies molecular networks which are highly consistent with the genetics and biochemistry of human metabolic disease.

F-box proteins form SCF (SKP1-Cullin1-F-box protein)-type ubiquitin (E3) ligases to selectively target their substrates for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here, we review F-box proteins associated with cancer development. S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) (also known as FBXL1) is often overexpressed in human cancers, and functions as an oncogenic E3 ligase to degrade tumor suppressor gene products. Moreover, F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBXW7) (also known as Fbw7) is often mutated in human cancers and functions as a tumor suppressive E3 ligase targeting oncogenic proteins for degradation. SKP2 is a potential drug target for cancer therapy and FBXW7 is useful in determining patient diagnosis, prognosis, and drug sensitivity. In this review, we also discuss other F-box proteins involved in cancer-associated cellular processes such as cell cycle control, epigenetic regulation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, apoptosis/survival, drug resistance, and DNA-damage responses.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Machine learning and multi-omics analysis reveal key regulators of proneural-mesenchymal transition in glioblastoma.. Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is classified into subtypes according to the molecular expression profile; the proneural subtype has a relatively good prognosis, and the mesenchymal type is the most aggressive form with the worst prognosis. GBM undergoes proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) during its evolution or in response to changes in the microenvironment or therapeutic interventions. PMT is accompanied by infiltration of non-tumor cells, decreased tumor purity, and immune evasion. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying PMT remain unclear. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using GBM transcriptome datasets, and prognostic analysis was performed to screen for PMT-related genes (PMTRGs). Consensus cluster analysis was followed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses of DEGs to determine the biological functions and pathways regulated by PMTRGs. CIBERSORT, TIMER, MCPCOUNTER, and XCELL algorithms were used to analyze immune cell infiltration patterns. The TIDE algorithm was used to examine immunotherapy scores. The Lasso, Cox, and Step machine learning algorithms were used to construct and screen the optimal risk assessment prognostic model. PMTRG expression patterns in patient tissues and different cell subsets were examined by proteomics and single-cell transcriptome data analysis. Seventeen DEGs and prognostic PMTRGs were identified in proneural and mesenchymal subtypes. PMTRG-related mRNA interactions and protein-protein interaction networks were associated with the immune activity of GBM. Consensus cluster analysis based on PMTRGs divided GBM into three independent subclusters. Functional and pathway analyses showed that PMTRGs were highly expressed in the C1 subcluster, which was associated with GBM mesenchymal isoforms, pathways, and poor prognosis, and showed stronger immune responses. Four immune evaluation algorithms and TIDE analysis showed that the C1 cluster had high levels of immune cell infiltration and immune molecule scores. The prognostic risk assessment model based on PMTRGs can effectively predict the prognosis of GBM patients. Proteomic data from immunohistochemistry and single-cell transcriptome data suggested that PMTRGs are predominantly expressed in monocytes, macrophages, and blood vessels rather than in tumor cells. This study identified 17 key genes associated with PMT in GBM. These PMTRGs are mainly expressed on immune cells and blood vessels in the GBM microenvironment and are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that PMT events mainly arise from the infiltration and activation of immune cells derived from the bone marrow and blood vessels. These findings provide new evidence and targets for the treatment of GBM. Journal: Scientific reports. Year: 2025. Authors: Xu C, Yang J, Xiong H, Cui X, Zhang Y.

Abstract: A prospective study was conducted to assess the efficacy and toxicity of a salvage regimen consisting of CCNU, Melphalan, and VP-16 (CAV) given at 28-day intervals in patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) relapsing after primary therapy or refractory to the alternating MOPP/ABVD regimen. This study included 58 patients (median age: 34 years), with resistant or relapsing HD. Primary therapy had consisted of alternating MOPP/ABVD (81%) or MOPP alone (19%); 38% of patients were relapsing from prior complete remission (CR) while 62% had resistant disease. Extranodal disease was present in 55% and B-symptoms in 72% of patients; one-fifth had bulky disease and/or bone marrow involvement. The CAV was used as first salvage in half of the patients. Complete remission was obtained in 17 patients (29%); unfavorable factors for CR in univariate analysis were the presence of bulky disease and the failure to achieve CR with prior therapy. Nine patients (53% of remitters) have subsequently relapsed with a 10-month median duration of CR. The 3-year overall survival after CAV was 25% with an 18-month median survival; significant differences in survival were found according to the extent of disease, the presence of B-symptoms and the HD status (prior sensitive or resistant disease, first or subsequent relapse). Seven patients are long-term remitters (12%), and one of them has been given high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation at relapse after CAV. The CAV toxicity was mostly hematological; severe pancytopenia occurred in six cases with two cases of fatal infections and one of fatal hemorrhage. CAV therapy was moderately effective as third-line salvage in patients with HD resistant to alternating MOPP/ABVD or previously given two different regimens for relapse; the toxicity was mostly hematological and supportive therapy was needed in one-third of the patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeted therapies and clinical trials in ovarian cancer.. Abstract: Recent advances in molecular profiling have shown that cancers arising from the ovary are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. Within histologies, many mutations in druggable targets are uncommon in frequency but mutations leading to activation of specific signal transduction pathways are common. These results support the notion that different targeted agents should be prioritized for testing between and within ovarian cancer histologies. The subsegmentation of ovarian cancers based on molecular features challenge traditional trial designs. Feasibility of accrual and need for data on biological and clinical consequence or target inhibition are leading to trial designs that lump or split patient populations by histology, pathway, gene, and/or mutation. This review summarizes potential therapeutic targets identified from recent molecular profiling studies of ovarian cancers and trial designs to evaluate targeted agents in rare cancer settings.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Emerging importance of HER3 in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.. Abstract: HER3 is a member of the HER/ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, together with EGFR (HER1), HER2 and HER4. Despite having only weak intrinsic kinase activity, HER3 can contribute to oncogenic signalling via ligand-induced heterodimerization with other HER family members. Evidence indicates that HER3 is altered or aberrantly expressed across a variety of tumour types and can be associated with poor clinical outcomes. Whereas anticancer agents targeting EGFR and HER2 have been approved for decades, no drug targeting HER3 had been approved until very recently. Initial targeting of HER3 with monoclonal antibodies as single agents or in combination with other therapeutics produced disappointing clinical results. Subsequently, efforts have been made to target HER3 with novel agents such as antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies, with promising efficacy observed in several trials encompassing various tumour types. In December 2024, the HER3\u2009\u00d7\u2009HER2 bispecific antibody zenocutuzumab was granted FDA Accelerated Approval for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancers or pancreatic cancers harbouring fusions involving NRG1, the gene encoding the high-affinity HER3 ligand neuregulin 1. In this Review, we provide an essential guide to HER3 signalling and oncogenesis, HER3 expression in cancer and its prognostic implications, oncogenic HER3 somatic mutations as well as rare NRG1 fusions that might depend on HER3 signalling, and the roles of HER3 in resistance to cancer therapies. We also highlight efforts to target HER3 with diverse therapeutic strategies and the potential interplay between HER3 and the antitumour immune response. Journal: Nature reviews. Clinical oncology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: RNA Activation-A Novel Approach to Therapeutically Upregulate Gene Transcription.. Abstract: RNA activation (RNAa) is a mechanism whereby RNA oligos complementary to genomic sequences around the promoter region of genes increase the transcription output of their target gene. Small activating RNA (saRNA) mediate RNAa through interaction with protein co-factors to facilitate RNA polymerase II activity and nucleosome remodeling. As saRNA are small, versatile and safe, they represent a new class of therapeutics that can rescue the downregulation of critical genes in disease settings. This review highlights our current understanding of saRNA biology and describes various examples of how saRNA are successfully used to treat various oncological, neurological and monogenic diseases. MTL-CEBPA, a first-in-class compound that reverses CEBPA downregulation in oncogenic processes using CEBPA-51 saRNA has entered clinical trial for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Preclinical models demonstrate that MTL-CEBPA reverses the immunosuppressive effects of myeloid cells and allows for the synergistic enhancement of other anticancer drugs. Encouraging results led to the initiation of a clinical trial combining MTL-CEBPA with a PD-1 inhibitor for treatment of solid tumors. Journal: Molecules (Basel, Switzerland). Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: MicroRNAs as Therapeutic Targets and Colorectal Cancer Therapeutics.. Abstract: The diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) have improved greatly over recent years; however, CRC is still one of the most common cancers and a major cause of cancer death worldwide. Several recently developed drugs and treatment strategies are currently in clinical trials; however, there is still a compelling need for novel, highly efficacious therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs consisting of 20-25 nucleotides that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs. miRNAs are known to regulate cancer pathways and to be expressed aberrantly in cancer. Since their initial discovery, a large number of miRNAs have been identified as oncogenes, whereas others function as tumor suppressors. Furthermore, signaling pathways that are important in CRC (e.g. the WNT, MAPK, TGF-\u03b2, TP53 and PI3K pathways) are regulated by miRNAs. A single miRNA can simultaneously regulate several target genes and pathways, indicating the therapeutic potential of miRNAs in CRC. However, significant obstacles remain to be overcome, such as an efficient miRNA delivery system, and the assessment of safety and side effects. Thus, miRNA therapy is still developing and possesses great potential for the treatment of CRC. In this chapter, we focus on miRNAs related to CRC and summarize previous studies that emphasize the therapeutic aspects of miRNAs in CRC. Journal: Advances in experimental medicine and biology.

Abstract: Molecular profiling guides precision treatment of breast cancer; however, Asian patients are underrepresented in publicly available large-scale studies. We established a comprehensive multiomics cohort of 773 Chinese patients with breast cancer and systematically analyzed their genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, radiomic and digital pathology characteristics. Here we show that compared to breast cancers in white individuals, Asian individuals had more targetable AKT1 mutations. Integrated analysis revealed a higher proportion of HER2-enriched subtype and correspondingly more frequent ERBB2 amplification and higher HER2 protein abundance in the Chinese HR<sup>+</sup>HER2<sup>+</sup> cohort, stressing anti-HER2 therapy for these individuals. Furthermore, comprehensive metabolomic and proteomic analyses revealed ferroptosis as a potential therapeutic target for basal-like tumors. The integration of clinical, transcriptomic, metabolomic, radiomic and pathological features allowed for efficient stratification of patients into groups with varying recurrence risks. Our study provides a public resource and new insights into the biology and ancestry specificity of breast cancer in the Asian population, offering potential for further precision treatment approaches.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Emergence of TNIK inhibitors in cancer therapeutics.. Abstract: The outcome of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer remains unsatisfactory. To improve patient prognosis, it will be necessary to identify new drug targets based on molecules that are essential for colorectal carcinogenesis, and to develop therapeutics that target such molecules. The great majority of colorectal cancers (>90%) have mutations in at least one Wnt signaling pathway gene. Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling is a major force driving colorectal carcinogenesis. Several therapeutics targeting Wnt pathway molecules, including porcupine, frizzled receptors and tankyrases, have been developed, but none of them have yet been incorporated into clinical practice. Wnt signaling is most frequently activated by loss of function of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene. Restoration of APC gene function does not seem to be a realistic therapeutic approach, and, therefore, only Wnt signaling molecules downstream of the APC gene product can be considered as targets for pharmacological intervention. Traf2 and Nck-interacting protein kinase (TNIK) was identified as a regulatory component of the \u03b2-catenin and T-cell factor-4 (TCF-4) transcriptional complex. Several small-molecule compounds targeting this protein kinase have been shown to have anti-tumor effects against various cancers. An anthelmintic agent, mebendazole, was recently identified as a selective inhibitor of TNIK and is under clinical evaluation. TNIK regulates Wnt signaling in the most downstream part of the pathway, and its pharmacological inhibition seems to be a promising therapeutic approach. We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by developing a small-molecule TNIK inhibitor, NCB-0846. Journal: Cancer science. Year: 2017. Authors: Yamada T, Masuda M.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Optimizing target selection and development strategy in cancer treatment: the next wave.. Abstract: Successful cancer treatments of the future are being developed with a focus on the molecular targets underlying the pathophysiology of neoplasia. Prominent targets which have emerged are those which are mutated in the course of a cancer's development, and mediate activation or release from suppression of pathways mediating proliferation or apoptosis. These arguably are \"pathogenic\" targets. However, equally important are targets which can be defined on the basis of \"large scale\" analysis techniques of gene or protein expression in tumors which define targets expressed as a result of a tumor's differentiation state or tissue of origin (\"ontogenic\" targets); targets mediating drug uptake or metabolism (\"pharmacologic\" targets), and \"microenvironmental\" targets mediating the alteration of tumor stromal elements. Irrespective of the nature of the molecular target which is the focus of new therapeutic efforts, target definition in susceptible tumors or patients ideally would be part of the development plan. In addition, an understanding of the therapeutic index which might be achieved in host vs tumor tissues using a surrogate or actual marker of drug effect ideally would be available from animal models and inform the development strategy in humans.

Abstract: Active surveillance after orchiectomy is the preferred management in clinical stage I (CSI) germ-cell tumours (GCT) associated with a 15 to 30% relapse rate. In the IGCCCG Update database, we compared the outcomes of gonadal disseminated GCT relapsing from initial CSI to outcomes of patients with de novo metastatic GCT. A total of 1014 seminoma (Sem) [298 (29.4%) relapsed from CSI, 716 (70.6%) de novo] and 3103 non-seminoma (NSem) [626 (20.2%) relapsed from CSI, 2477 (79.8%) de novo] were identified. Among Sem, no statistically significant differences in PFS and OS were found between patients relapsing from CSI and de novo metastatic disease [5-year progression-free survival (5y-PFS) 87.6% versus 88.5%; 5-year overall survival (5y-OS) 93.2% versus 96.1%). Among NSem, PFS and OS were higher overall in relapsing CSI patients (5y-PFS 84.6% versus 80.0%; 5y-OS 93.3% versus 88.7%), but there were no differences within the same IGCCCG prognostic groups (HR\u2009=\u20090.89; 95% CI: 0.70-1.12). Relapses in the intermediate or poor prognostic groups occurred in 11/298 (4%) Sem and 112/626 (18%) NSem. Relapsing CSI GCT patients expect similar survival compared to de novo metastatic patients of the same ICCCCG prognostic group. Intermediate and poor prognosis relapses from initial CSI expose patients to unnecessary toxicity from more intensive treatments. Journal: British journal of cancer. Year: 2023.

Abstract: Understanding dysregulated genes and pathways in cancer is critical for precision oncology. Integrating mass spectrometry-based proteomic data with transcriptomic data presents unique opportunities for systematic analyses of dysregulated genes and pathways in pan-cancer. Here, we compiled a comprehensive set of datasets, encompassing proteomic data from 2404 samples and transcriptomic data from 7752 samples across 13 cancer types. Comparisons between normal or adjacent normal tissues and tumor tissues identified several dysregulated pathways including mRNA splicing, interferon pathway, fatty acid metabolism, and complement coagulation cascade in pan-cancer. Additionally, pan-cancer upregulated and downregulated genes (PCUGs and PCDGs) were also identified. Notably, RRM2 and ADH1B, two genes which belong to PCUGs and PCDGs, respectively, were identified as robust pan-cancer diagnostic biomarkers. TNM stage-based comparisons revealed dysregulated genes and biological pathways involved in cancer progression, among which the dysregulation of complement coagulation cascade and epithelial-mesenchymal transition are frequent in multiple types of cancers. A group of pan-cancer continuously upregulated and downregulated proteins in different tumor stages (PCCUPs and PCCDPs) were identified. We further constructed prognostic risk stratification models for corresponding cancer types based on dysregulated genes, which effectively predict the prognosis for patients with these cancers. Drug prediction based on PCUGs and PCDGs as well as PCCUPs and PCCDPs revealed that small molecule inhibitors targeting CDK, HDAC, MEK, JAK, PI3K, and others might be effective treatments for pan-cancer, thereby supporting drug repurposing. We also developed web tools for cancer diagnosis, pathologic stage assessment, and risk evaluation. Overall, this study highlights the power of combining proteomic and transcriptomic data to identify valuable diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as drug targets and treatments for cancer.

Abstract: While many patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-mediated disease (MOG-AD) will have a monophasic course, 30-80% of patients will relapse after the initial attack. It is not known which factors predict relapse. Here we describe our clinical experience with MOG-AD and evaluate for factors that correlate with relapsing disease. This was a retrospective, multi-institutional study of 54 patients with MOG-AD, including 17 children and 37 adults. Mann-Whitney U and Fischer's Exact tests were used for comparisons and logistic regression for correlations. Incident attack phenotype included acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (15%), unilateral optic neuritis (ON; 39%), bilateral ON (24%), transverse myelitis (TM; 11%) and ON with TM (11%). Pediatric patients were more likely than adults to present with ADEM (p\u00a0=\u00a0.009) and less likely to present with unilateral ON (p\u00a0=\u00a0.04). 31 patients (57%) had a relapsing disease course, with time to first relapse of 8.2 months and median annualized relapse rate of 0.97 months. In 40% of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a022) the first relapse occurred following the withdrawal of treatment for the incident attack. 5 patients converted to seronegative at follow up, 2 of whom later relapsed. Logistic regression revealed no significant relationship between age, gender, race, presentation phenotype, antibody titer, or cerebrospinal fluid results with risk of relapse. For patients who started disease modifying therapy (DMT) prior to the first relapse (n\u00a0=\u00a011), 64% remained monophasic. 50% (n\u00a0=\u00a015) of patients on DMT continued to have disease activity, requiring treatment adjustment. It is difficult to predict which patients with MOG-AD will relapse. Research is needed to determine the optimal timing and choice of treatment. Journal: Multiple sclerosis and related disorders.

Abstract: Although the zebrafish has many attributes of a promising cancer model, one outstanding question is how similar zebrafish and human tumors are at the molecular level. To date, supporting data from histology and 'gene-to-gene' comparisons with human data offer limited insights. Using comparative microarray analyses, we found striking molecular similarities between zebrafish and human liver neoplasia. Our data indicate that zebrafish liver tumors possess the general molecular hallmarks of human liver cancer and some of the molecular similarities extend to the progression of liver tumors. The molecular conservation between fish and human liver tumors underscored the strong association and fundamental importance of these genes in liver neoplasia as well as their clinical potentials as diagnostic markers and/or therapeutic targets. In addition, our comparative oncogenomic work provides a general framework for comparing and validating microarray data of zebrafish model with human cancer, thus adding confidence of using the zebrafish to model human cancers.

Abstract: Surveillance of clinical stage I (CSI) testicular germ cell tumors (GCT) is hampered by low sensitivity and specificity of current biomarkers for detecting relapses. This study evaluated if serum levels of microRNA371a-3p (M371 test) can: (i) Accurately detect relapses, (ii) detect relapses earlier than conventional technology, and (iii) if elevated postoperative M371 levels may predict relapse. In a multicentric setting, 258 patients with testicular CSI GCT were prospectively followed by surveillance for a median time of 18 months with serial measurements of serum M371 levels, in addition to standard diagnostic techniques. Diagnostic characteristics of M371 for detecting relapses were calculated using ROC curve analysis. Thirty-nine patients recurred (15.1%), all with elevated M371 levels; eight without relapse had elevations, too. The test revealed the following characteristics: area under the ROC curve of 0.993, sensitivity 100%, specificity 96.3%, positive predictive value 83%, negative predictive value 100%. Earlier relapse detection with the test was found in 28%, with non-significant median time gain to diagnosis. Postoperative M371 levels did not predict future relapse. The sensitivity and specificity of the M371 test for detecting relapses in CSI GCTs are much superior to those of conventional diagnostics. However, post-orchiectomy M371 levels are not predictive of relapse, and there is no significant earlier relapse detection with the test. In all, there is clear evidence for the utility of the M371 test for relapse detection suggesting it may soon be ready for implementation into routine follow-up schedules for patients with testicular GCT.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common subtype of primary liver cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. To gain more insights into the transcriptomic landscape and molecular mechanism of HCC, we performed TMT-labelled tandem mass spectrometry (n\u2009=\u20094) and whole-transcriptome sequencing (n\u2009=\u20093) based on HCC tumour (T) and adjacent normal (N) tissues from seven HCC patients. To comprehensively evaluate the gene-regulatory circuits in HCC, differential expression and enrichment analyses were performed on the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), genes (DEGs), miRNAs (555), lncRNAs (29) and circRNAs (895). A total of 977 proteins and 243 genes were found to be differentially expressed in HCC tumours compared with adjacent normal tissues. HCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were used to validate the results. Combined with the results above, 56 DEP-DEGs with common changes in relative quantity were identified. Functional pathway analysis showed that the DEP-DEGs were mainly enriched in the spliceosome and various metabolic processes. Bioinformatics analysis showed that hsa-miR-1266-5p, hsa-miR-128-1-5p, hsa-miR-139-5p, hsa-miR-34b-3p and hsa-miR-570-3p were involved in the regulation of the hub genes mentioned above. The crucial coexpression (lncRNA-mRNA, circRNA-mRNA) and competing endogenous RNA interaction axes showed the possible functions of the lncRNAs and circRNAs. We explored potential cancer biomarkers by combining proteomic and transcriptomic studies. Our study provides a valuable resource for understanding regulatory mechanisms at the RNA level and may ultimately further assist in the development of diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets for HCC.

Abstract: Glioma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor among adults, among which glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits the highest malignancy. Despite current standard chemoradiation, glioma is still invariably fatal. A further insight into the molecular background of glioma is required to improve patient outcomes. Previous studies evaluated molecular genetic differences through comparing different grades of glioma. Here, we integrated DNA methylation, RNA sequencing and protein expression data sets of WHO grade II to IV gliomas, to screen for dysregulated genes in subtypes during malignant progression of glioma. We propose a list of universal genes (UG) as novel glioma biomarkers: 977 up-regulated genes and 114 down-regulated genes, who involved in cell cycle, Wnt receptor signaling pathway and fatty acid metabolic process. Poorer survival was associated significantly with the high expression of 977 up-regulated genes and low expression of 114 down-regulated in UG (P <0.001). To our knowledge, this was the first study that focused on subtypes to detect dysregulated genes that could contribute to malignant progression. Furthermore, the differentially expressed genes profile may lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for glioma patients.

Abstract: To report our experience with the use of fidaxomicin (FDX), an oral macrocyclic antibiotic, in cancer patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). A single-center retrospective case series was conducted at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patients with CDI treated with FDX from May 2011 to January 2013 were identified via the pharmacy database. Clinical response and recurrence after FDX initiation were evaluated. Twenty-two patients were included, most of whom were male (55%) with a mean age of 58 years (range: 20-83 yrs). The most common underlying malignancies were nine patients with lymphoma (41%), seven with leukemia (32%), and six with solid tumors (27%). Indications for FDX included recurrent CDI in 16 patients (72%) and failure of both metronidazole and oral vancomycin in 6 patients (28%). Nineteen patients (86%) were on concomitant antimicrobials during CDI treatment. Clinical response to FDX was 91%, and overall sustained clinical response was 82%. FDX was well tolerated with no major adverse events that were FDX related or discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events. In cancer patients, FDX is effective treatment for the first episode of CDI after failure of standard therapies and treatment of recurrent CDI. This was interesting given the large number of high-risk patients who continued to receive concomitant antimicrobial therapy, which is common in this immunocompromised patient population.

Abstract: Deciphering the variations in the protein interactome is required to reach a systems-level understanding of tumorigenesis. To accomplish this task, we have considered the clinical and transcriptome data on >6000 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas for 12 different cancers. Utilizing the gene expression levels as a proxy, we have identified the differential protein-protein interactions in each cancer type and presented a differential view of human protein interactome among the cancers. We clearly demonstrate that a certain fraction of proteins differentially interacts in the cancers, but there was no general protein interactome profile that applied to all cancers. The analysis also provided the characterization of differentially interacting proteins (DIPs) representing significant changes in their interaction patterns during tumorigenesis. In addition, DIP-centered protein modules with high diagnostic and prognostic performances were generated, which might potentially be valuable in not only understanding tumorigenesis, but also developing effective diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The EphA2 and cancer connection: potential for immune-based interventions.. Abstract: The Eph (erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular) receptors form the largest known subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. These receptors interact with membrane-bound ephrin ligands via direct cell-cell interactions resulting in bi-directional activation of signal pathways. Importantly, the Eph receptors play critical roles in embryonic tissue organization and homeostasis, and in the maintenance of adult processes such as long-term potentiation, angiogenesis, and stem cell differentiation. The Eph receptors also display properties of both tumor promoters and suppressors depending on the cellular context. Characterization of EphA2 receptor in regard to EphA2 dysregulation has revealed associations with various pathological processes, especially cancer. The analysis of various tumor types generally identify EphA2 receptor as overexpressed and/or mutated, and for certain types of cancers EphA2 is linked with poor prognosis and decreased patient survival. Thus, here we highlight the role of EphA2 in malignant tissues that are specific to cancer; these include glioblastoma multiforme, prostate cancer, ovarian and uterine cancers, gastric carcinoma, melanoma, and breast cancer. Due to its large extracellular domain, therapeutic targeting of EphA2 with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which may function as inhibitors of ligand activation or as molecular agonists, has been an oft-attempted strategy. Therefore, we review the most current mAb-based therapies against EphA2 expressing cancers currently in pre-clinical and/or clinical stages. Finally, we discuss the latest peptides and cyclical-peptides that function as selective agonists for EphA2 receptor. Journal: Molecular biology reports. Year: 2020. Authors: London M, Gallo E.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Spatial Heterogeneity and Evolutionary Dynamics Modulate Time to Recurrence in Continuous and Adaptive Cancer Therapies.. Abstract: Treatment of advanced cancers has benefited from new agents that supplement or bypass conventional therapies. However, even effective therapies fail as cancer cells deploy a wide range of resistance strategies. We propose that evolutionary dynamics ultimately determine survival and proliferation of resistant cells. Therefore, evolutionary strategies should be used with conventional therapies to delay or prevent resistance. Using an agent-based framework to model spatial competition among sensitive and resistant populations, we applied antiproliferative drug treatments to varying ratios of sensitive and resistant cells. We compared a continuous maximum-tolerated dose schedule with an adaptive schedule aimed at tumor control via competition between sensitive and resistant cells. Continuous treatment cured mostly sensitive tumors, but with any resistant cells, recurrence was inevitable. We identified two adaptive strategies that control heterogeneous tumors: dose modulation controls most tumors with less drug, while a more vacation-oriented schedule can control more invasive tumors. These findings offer potential modifications to treatment regimens that may improve outcomes and reduce resistance and recurrence.<b>Significance:</b> By using drug dose modulation or treatment vacations, adaptive therapy strategies control the emergence of tumor drug resistance by spatially suppressing less fit resistant populations in favor of treatment sensitive ones. <i>Cancer Res; 78(8); 2127-39. \u00a92018 AACR</i>.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Drug-Target Interaction Network Analysis of Gene-Phenotype Connectivity Maintained by Genistein.. Abstract: Genistein is a type of isoflavone, which has been widely described as an antitumor agent in many cancers. The present study aimed to provide information on the mechanisms of genistein's activity and thus enable a wider range of targeted therapies in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cancer. We searched the DrugBank database for direct targets of genistein, which were then analyzed through the STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) database to predict their secondary protein targets. Thirteen primary protein targets of genistein and 209 secondary protein targets-associated genes were identified. The data were integrated into the network of protein targets-associated genes and visualized with the Cytoscape software. We further carried out GO (Gene Ontology) analysis and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome) pathway analysis using DAVID (database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery) tool. The top 14 KEGG pathways were further assessed, and 19 overlapping genes derived from pathways of hepatitis B and cancer were discovered. The overlapping targets were further mapped in the online tool UALCAN to evaluate the survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. We found that the overexpression of Grb2 (growth factor receptor-binding protein 2) (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) was linked to poor overall survival for liver HCC patients, followed by AKT1 (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.0015) and PIK3CA (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.0088). The present study analyzes the drug-target-disease network and may prove to be a useful tool in gene-phenotype connectivity for genistein in HBV-related liver cancer. Our data also pave the way for further research on Grb2 during the development of chronic HBV infection in liver cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrative genomic and bioinformatic prioritization of drug repurposing candidates for prostate cancer.. Abstract: Prostate cancer remains a prevalent global health challenge, with limited treatment options for advanced stages. There is a critical need to identify effective therapies through systematic integration of genomic and biological data. We analyzed 10,911 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 554 genes from genome- and phenome-wide association studies to identify biological risk genes for prostate cancer. Bioinformatic analysis was used to map these genes to key pathways and potential drug targets. Drug repurposing opportunities were assessed through Connectivity Map (CMap) transcriptomic signature analysis in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, with additional molecular docking studies to evaluate drug-target interactions. We identified 77 prostate cancer-associated genes. Drug repurposing analysis revealed 59 drugs targeting 13 genes, including 11 approved for prostate cancer and 22 in clinical or preclinical development. Notably, 26 candidate drugs had not been previously linked to prostate cancer. CMap analysis prioritized five candidates: estradiol-benzoate and estradiol-cypionate (targeting ESR2), which showed the highest CMap scores, danazol and oxymetholone (targeting AR), and selumetinib (targeting MAP2K1/MEK), each demonstrating potential to modulate key pathways in prostate cancer. Molecular docking analysis further supported these findings, revealing that estradiol-benzoate and estradiol-cypionate have strong predicted binding affinities for ESR2, while selumetinib robustly interacts with MAP2K1. Conversely, danazol and oxymetholone displayed weaker predicted binding, suggesting a more limited capacity for direct protein engagement. Integrating genomics, bioinformatics, and molecular docking provides an effective strategy for identifying and prioritizing drug repurposing candidates in prostate cancer. Estradiol-benzoate, estradiol-cypionate, and selumetinib emerge as promising candidates, meriting further preclinical and clinical evaluation for advanced prostate cancer therapy.

Abstract: The scope of nanotechnology has been extended to almost every sphere of our daily life. As a result of this, nanocarriers like Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are gaining considerable attention for their use in various therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The objective of the current article is to review various important features of CNTs that make them as efficient carriers for anticancer drug delivery in cancer therapeutics. In this review article, different works of literature are reported on various prospective applications of CNTs in the targeting of multiple kinds of cancerous cells of different organs via; the loading of various anticancer agents. Actually, CNTs are the 3rd allotropic type of the carbon-fullerenes that are a part of the cylindrical tubular architecture. CNTs possess some excellent physicochemical characteristics and unique structural features that provide an effective platform to deliver anticancer drugs to target specific sites for achieving a high level of therapeutic effectiveness even in cancer therapeutics. For better results, CNTs are functionalized and modified with different classes of therapeutically bioactive molecules via; the formation of stable covalent bonding or by the use of supramolecular assemblies based on the noncovalent interaction(s). In recent years, the applications of CNTs for the delivery of various kinds of anticancer drugs and targeting of tumor sites have been reported by various research groups. CNTs represent an emerging nanocarrier material for the delivery and targeting of numerous anticancer drugs in cancer therapeutics. Journal: Current drug delivery. Year: 2020.

Abstract: The global alliance for genomics and healthcare facilities provides innovative solutions to expedite research and clinical practices for complex and incurable health conditions. Precision oncology is an emerging field explicitly tailored to facilitate cancer diagnosis, prevention, and treatment based on patients' genetic profiles. Advancements in \"omics\" techniques, next-generation sequencing, artificial intelligence, and clinical trial designs provide a platform for assessing the efficacy and safety of combination therapies and diagnostic procedures. Data were collected from PubMed and Google Scholar using keywords \"Precision medicine,\" \"precision medicine and cancer,\" \"anticancer agents in precision medicine,\" and reviewed comprehensively. Personalized therapeutics, including immunotherapy and cancer vaccines, serve as a groundbreaking solution for cancer treatment. Herein, we take a measurable view of precision therapies and novel diagnostic approaches targeting cancer treatment. The contemporary applications of precision medicine have also been described, along with various hurdles identified in the successful establishment of precision therapeutics. This review highlights the key breakthroughs related to immunotherapies, targeted anticancer agents, and target interventions related to cancer signaling mechanisms. The success story of this field in context to drug resistance, safety, patient survival, and improving quality of life is yet to be elucidated.

Abstract: About one fourth of patients with Hodgkin's disease relapse after therapy. The mechanisms that lead to resistance to treatment in these patients are poorly understood. The authors describe the differential protein expression of p53, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and p21 at initial presentation and relapse, and discuss their role in disease progression and resistance to therapy. Thirty-four patients with Hodgkin's disease who had relapsed after standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens were assessed for the expression of p53 protein, PCNA, and p21 protein (waf/cip 1). In 14 of these cases, sequential biopsies performed both at presentation and at relapse were available for the study. Seventy-five percent of the cases were positive for the p53 protein. Tumors at relapse had higher p53 and PCNA scores than those at initial presentation. In the paired samples, a significant increase was noted in the number of p53 and PCNA-positive cells and in the intensity of staining with p53 antibody. Six of seven paired samples tested for p21 showed an increased p21 expression at relapse. These results suggest that, at relapse, Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells and their variants positive for p53, PCNA, and p21 are increased in number and individually have an increased expression of p53, PCNA, and p21 proteins. These findings suggest that therapy failure and relapse may, at least in part, be associated with altered p53, p21, and PCNA pathways. HUM PATHOL 28:549-555.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: An insight into the risk factors of brain tumors and their therapeutic interventions.. Abstract: Brain tumors are an abnormal growth of cells in the brain, also known as multifactorial groups of neoplasm. Incidence rates of brain tumors increase rapidly, and it has become a leading cause of tumor related deaths globally. Several factors have potential risks for intracranial neoplasm. To date, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified the ionizing radiation and the N-nitroso compounds as established carcinogens and probable carcinogens respectively. Diagnosis of brain tumors is based on histopathology and suitable imaging techniques. Labeled amino acids and fluorodeoxyglucose with or without contrast-enhanced MRI are used for the evaluation of tumor traces. T2-weighted MRI is an advanced diagnostic implementation, used for the detection of low-grade gliomas. Treatment decisions are based on tumor size, location, type, patient's age and health status. Conventional therapeutic approaches for tumor treatment are surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. While the novel strategies may include targeted therapy, electric field treatments and vaccine therapy. Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors is an attractive tumor mitigation strategy for advanced-stage cancers; in the future, it may prove to be a useful targeted therapy. The blood-brain barrier poses a major hurdle in the transport of therapeutics towards brain tissues. Moreover, nanomedicine has gained a vital role in cancer therapy. Nano drug delivery system such as liposomal drug delivery has been widely used in the cancer treatment. Liposome encapsulated drugs have improved therapeutic efficacy than free drugs. Numerous treatment therapies for brain tumors are in advanced clinical research. Journal: Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie. Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Influence of multidrug resistance and drug transport proteins on chemotherapy drug metabolism.. Abstract: Chemotherapy involving the use of anticancer drugs remains an important strategy in the overall management of patients with metastatic cancer. Acquisition of multidrug resistance remains a major impediment to successful chemotherapy. Drug transporters in cell membranes and intracellular drug metabolizing enzymes contribute to the resistance phenotype and determine the pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs in the body. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate the transport of endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics including cytotoxic drugs out of cells. Solute carrier (SLC) transporters mediate the influx of cytotoxic drugs into cells. This review focuses on the substrate interaction of these transporters, on their biology and what role they play together with drug metabolizing enzymes in eliminating therapeutic drugs from cells. The majority of anticancer drugs are substrates for the ABC transporter and SLC transporter families. Together, these proteins have the ability to control the influx and the efflux of structurally unrelated chemotherapeutic drugs, thereby modulating the intracellular drug concentration. These interactions have important clinical implications for chemotherapy because ultimately they determine therapeutic efficacy, disease progression/relapse and the success or failure of patient treatment.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: NGAL as a Potential Target in Tumor Microenvironment.. Abstract: The signaling network between cancer and stromal cells plays a crucial role in tumor microenvironment. The fate of tumor progression mainly depends on the huge amount of information that these cell populations exchange from the onset of neoplastic transformation. Interfering with such signaling has been producing exciting results in cancer therapy: just think of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 antibodies that, acting as immune checkpoint inhibitors, interrupt the inhibitory signaling exerted by cancer cells on immune cells or the CAR-T technology that fosters the reactivation of anti-tumoral immunity in a restricted group of leukemias and lymphomas. Nevertheless, many types of cancers, in particular solid tumors, are still refractory to these treatments, so the identification of novel molecular targets in tumor secretome would benefit from implementation of current anti-cancer therapeutical strategies. Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) is a secreted protein abundantly expressed in the secretome of various human tumors. It represents a promising target for the multiple roles that are played inside cancer and stromal cells, and also overall in their cross-talk. The review focuses on the different roles of NGAL in tumor microenvironment and in cancer senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), highlighting the most crucial functions that could be eventually targetable in cancer therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Signalomics for molecular tumor boards and precision oncology of breast and gynecological cancers.. Abstract: Precision oncology led to the establishment and widespread application of molecular tumor boards (MTBs)-multidisciplinary units combining molecular and clinical assessment of individual cancer cases for swift selection of personalized treatments. Whole-exome or gene panel sequencing, combined with transcriptomic, immunohistochemical, and other molecular analyses, often permits dissection of molecular drivers of a tumor and identification of its potential targetable vulnerabilities, instructing clinical oncologists on sometimes unconventional treatment options. However, cancer drivers are often unleashed mutation-independently, especially in breast and gynecological cancers, and deleterious mutations are not always pathogenic. To complement the MTB arsenal, we chart here the molecular toolset we call Signalomics that permits fast and robust assessment of a panel of oncogenic signaling pathways in fresh tumor samples. Using transcriptional reporters introduced in primary tumor cells, this approach identifies the pathways overactivated in a given tumor and validates their sensitivity to targeted therapies, providing actionable insights for personalized treatment strategies. Integration of Signalomics into MTB workflows bridges the gap between molecular profiling and functional pathway analysis, refining clinical treatment decisions and advancing precision oncology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The interval between courses of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue: therapeutic hypotheses.. Abstract: The interval between courses of chemotherapy have classically been kept to a minimum in order to maximize dose intensity. Certain clinical observations suggest that longer intervals, particularly in the high-dose setting, may be more effective. This is based in part on the evidence that resistance is reversible over time and that the interval should be sufficient to allow for such a reversal. Clinical evidence for such reversibility include the following. In metastatic breast cancer, double or double high-dose stem cell rescue (HD-SCR) studies involving a minimal interval, have not, at least as yet, been shown to be superior to single HD-SCR. In Hodgkin's disease, response after relapse correlates directly with duration of time to relapse. In a comparative study of metastatic breast cancer, early HD-SCR preceded by daunorubicin induction was inferior to delayed HD-SCR. The latter was not preceded by induction chemotherapy. In a comparative study of childhood ALL, patients randomized to delayed (4 month interval) intensification had a significantly superior survival as compared to patients randomized to immediate (1 month interval) intensification. Taken together, these clinical observations indicate that resistance is reversible and that optimization of the interval must take this into account. Cytokinetic modeling of those clinical studies also found that delayed HD-SCR could result in a superior effect. Cytokinetic models of minimal residual tumor which were also examined included the Skipper exponential model, the Norton-Simon model which emphasizes the Gompertzian effect, the clonal evolution model, and the Retsky-Demisheli model which derives from a bimodal relapse pattern above. Biological and clinical data have resulted in a clinical protocol in the CALGB wherein patients with metastatic breast cancer are randomly allocated to (1) a single HD-SCR arm; (2) a double HD-SCR with a 5-week interval; and (3) a double HD-SCR arm with a 16 week interval.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a common cancer and could result in a substantial mortality. The study aimed to screen gene signatures associated with the development and metastasis of breast cancer and explore their regulation mechanisms. Three datasets of GSE10797, GSE8977 and GSE3744 were downloaded from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database, containing 55 breast cancer samples and 27 normal samples. After data preprocessing using limma software and RMA (robust multi-array average) algorithm, DEGs (differentially expressed genes) between breast tumor and normal tissues in three individual experiments were identified using MADAM package. Function and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. Transcription factors and TAGs (tumor associated genes) among the DEGs were recognized and the PPI (protein-protein-interaction) network for the DEGs was constructed using Cytoscape software. The mRNA expression was analyzed via real-time quantitative PCR and protein expression was measured by western blotting. Totally, 100 DEGs were identified, including 33 up-regulated genes and 67 down-regulated genes. Among them, up-regulated DEGs such as CD80 was enriched in toll-like receptor (TLR) interaction pathway and the TAG, ISG15 was related to RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, while CXCL10 was involved in both of the two pathways. Whereas, the down-regulated DEG, CXCL12 was significantly associated with axon guidance pathway. Additionally, these DEGs were also pivotal nodes in the PPI network with high degrees. Besides, CXCL10 and CD80 were both interacted with IFNG. The mRNA expression of ISG15 was obviously enhanced in human breast cancer cells MCF-7, while no significant difference of CXCL10 mRNA level was found between MCF10A and MCF-7 cells. Moreover, the proteins expression levels of CD80 and ISG15 were significantly increased in MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells than in normal MCF10A cells. CD80 might be responsible for the breast cancer's progression and metastasis via regulating innate immune system. In addition, ISG15 is identified as a crucial gene signature associated with breast cancer development and metastasis via RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Vertical pathway targeting in cancer therapy.. Abstract: Malignant cells arise from particular mutations in genes controlling cell proliferation, invasion, and survival. Older antineoplastic drugs were designed to target vital cellular processes, such as DNA maintenance and repair and cell division. As a result, these drugs can affect all proliferating cells and are associated with unavoidable toxicities. Recent discoveries in cancer research have identified \"driver\" mutations in some types of cancer, and efforts have been undertaken to develop drugs targeting these oncogenes. In most cases, due to escape mechanisms and adaptive responses, single oncogene targeting is insufficient to induce prolonged responses in solid tumors. Drug combinations are therefore used to enhance the growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of the targeted therapies. Depending on the position of additional targets within the signaling network, drug combinations may target either different signaling pathways (parallel targeting) or the same pathway at several fragile nodes (vertical targeting). In this review, we discuss strategies of multitarget inhibition with a focus on vertical signaling pathway targeting. Journal: Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.). Year: 2012.

Abstract: One hundred and twenty-three breakthrough bacteraemias (BB) were defined during a 5-year period in a National Cancer Centre, among 9986 admissions and a total of 979 bacteraemic episodes analysed. Of 123 bacteraemias in 103 patients, 77 were polymicrobial and 116 of the 323 organisms isolated were resistant to currently administered antimicrobial agents. Sixty-seven of the bacteraemic episodes were catheter-associated, as confirmed by the isolation of the same organisms from both blood and catheter tip. The strains isolated most frequently were coagulase-negative staphylococci (30.5%), corynebacteria (10%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%) and viridans streptococci (8.5%). Gram-positive aerobes accounted for two-thirds of all micro-organisms isolated during breakthrough bacteraemic and fungaemic episodes. Polymicrobial episodes were associated more frequently with vascular catheters and neutropenia, and had a less favourable outcome than monomicrobial infections. Relapse was associated more frequently with catheter-related episodes, but the overall mortality rate was similar and independent of catheter insertion. Breakthrough bacteraemic and fungaemic episodes were associated more frequently with acute leukaemia. Catheter removal, as an independent variable, and modification of antimicrobial therapy were essential for better outcome. Journal: Journal of medical microbiology. Year: 1997.

Abstract: Anti-angiogenic agents elicit considerable immune modulatory effects within the tumor microenvironment, underscoring the rationale for synergistic clinical development of VEGF and immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Early phase studies involving Asian patients demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor efficacies. We report the results of the REGOMUNE phase II study, in which Caucasian patients were administered regorafenib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with avelumab, a PD-L1-targeting monoclonal antibody. This therapeutic regimen resulted in deep and durable responses in 19% of patients, with the median duration of response not yet reached. Notwithstanding, a significant proportion of AGC patients exhibited no therapeutic advantage, prompting investigations into mechanisms of inherent resistance. Comprehensive biomarker profiling elucidated that non-responders predominantly exhibited an augmented presence of M2 macrophages within the tumor microenvironment and a marked overexpression of S100A10 by neoplastic cells, a protein previously implicated in macrophage chemotaxis. Additionally, peripheral biomarker assessments identified elevated levels of cytokines, including CSF-1, IL-4, IL-8, and TWEAK, correlating with adverse clinical outcomes, thereby accentuating the role of macrophage infiltration in mediating resistance. These insights furnish an invaluable foundation for elucidating, and potentially circumventing, resistance mechanisms in current AGC therapeutic paradigms, emphasizing the integral role of tumor microenvironmental dynamics and immune modulation.

Abstract: RNA therapeutics (RNATx) aim to treat diseases, including cancer, by targeting or employing RNA molecules for therapeutic purposes. Amongst the most promising targets are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which regulate oncogenic molecular networks in a cell type-restricted manner. lncRNAs are distinct from protein-coding genes in important ways that increase their therapeutic potential yet also present hurdles to conventional clinical development. Advances in genome editing, oligonucleotide chemistry, multi-omics and RNA engineering are paving the way for efficient and cost-effective lncRNA-focused drug discovery pipelines. In this Review, we present the emerging field of lncRNA therapeutics for oncology, with emphasis on the unique strengths and challenges of lncRNAs within the broader RNATx framework.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Network Pharmacology: Exploring the Resources and Methodologies.. Abstract: Multi-target and combinatorial therapies have been focused for the past several decades. These approaches achieved considerable therapeutic efficacy by modulating the activities of the targets in complex diseases such as HIV-1 infection, cancer and diabetes disease. Most of the diseases cannot be treated efficiently in terms of single gene target, because it involves the cessation of the coordinated function of distinct gene groups. Most of the cellular components work efficiently by interacting with other cellular components and all these interactions together represent interactome. This interconnectivity shows that a defect in a single gene may not be restricted to the gene product itself, but may spread along the network. So, drug development must be based on the network-based perspective of disease mechanisms. Many systematic diseases like neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and cardiovascular cannot be treated efficiently by the single gene target strategy because these diseases involve the complex biological machinery. In clinical trials, many mono-therapies have been found to be less effective. In mono-therapies, the long term treatment, for the systematic diseases make the diseases able to acquired resistance because of the disease nature of the natural evolution of feedback loop and pathway redundancy. Multi-target drugs might be more efficient. Multi-target therapeutics might be less vulnerable because of the inability of the biological system to resist multiple actions. In this study, we will overview the recent advances in the development of methodologies for the identification of drug target interaction and its application in the poly-pharmacology profile of the drug.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: IOBR: Multi-Omics Immuno-Oncology Biological Research to Decode Tumor Microenvironment and Signatures.. Abstract: Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have triggered the rapid accumulation of publicly available multi-omics datasets. The application of integrated omics to explore robust signatures for clinical translation is increasingly emphasized, and this is attributed to the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockades in diverse malignancies. However, effective tools for comprehensively interpreting multi-omics data are still warranted to provide increased granularity into the intrinsic mechanism of oncogenesis and immunotherapeutic sensitivity. Therefore, we developed a computational tool for effective Immuno-Oncology Biological Research (IOBR), providing a comprehensive investigation of the estimation of reported or user-built signatures, TME deconvolution, and signature construction based on multi-omics data. Notably, IOBR offers batch analyses of these signatures and their correlations with clinical phenotypes, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) profiling, genomic characteristics, and signatures generated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in different cancer settings. Additionally, IOBR integrates multiple existing microenvironmental deconvolution methodologies and signature construction tools for convenient comparison and selection. Collectively, IOBR is a user-friendly tool for leveraging multi-omics data to facilitate immuno-oncology exploration and to unveil tumor-immune interactions and accelerating precision immunotherapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Efficacy of the BEACOPP regimen in refractory and relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.. Abstract: The BEACOPP regimen is a consolidated first-line treatment regimen for advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), while few data are available on the efficacy of this regimen in advanced disease. About 50% of patients with HL relapsed after or refractory to first-line therapy achieve a durable response after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Patients relapsing after a PBSCT (performed as second line therapy) have a very poor prognosis. We evaluated the efficacy of BEACOPP in two settings: patients refractory or in relapse after first-line therapy (Group A) and patients relapsing after a PBSCT (Group B). Twenty-three patients with HL, admitted between February 2003 and April 2007, were retrospectively studied: 10 patients in Group A and 13 in Group B. Group A: Nine complete remissions (CR) and one partial remission (PR) were achieved following BEACOPP treatment. After a median follow-up of 32 months, one patient has died due to secondary leukemia, while the other eight are alive, five (50%) in second CR, three in third CR after PBSCT and one with disease. Group B: Eight of the 13 patients (62%) obtained a CR, one patient a PR, two were refractory and two have died of toxicity. To date, eight patients (62%) are alive, four (31%) still in CR. All patients experienced hematologic toxicity (WHO 3-4) with two deaths due to septic shock. These results show that BEACOPP is an effective regimen for both refractory/relapsed patients with HL after first-line treatment (Group A) and for patients relapsing after a PBSCT (Group B) with a 3-year probability of overall survival, progression-free survival, and cumulative incidence of relapse of 90, 50, and 33.3% in Group A, and 61, 31, and 37.5% in Group B, respectively.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The breast cancer antigen 5T4 interacts with Rab11, and is a target and regulator of Rab11 mediated trafficking.. Abstract: 5T4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with limited expression in normal adult tissues and expression in some solid tumours. It is unclear whether 5T4 is preferentially expressed by stem or differentiated cell types. Modes of 5T4 regulation are unknown despite its ongoing development as a cancer immunotherapy target. Our aims were to clarify the differentiation status of 5T4 expressing cells in breast cancer and to understand the mechanism underlying 5T4 membrane presentation. We analysed 5T4 expression in breast cancer cell populations by flow cytometery and found that 5T4 is highly expressed on differentiated cells, where it localizes to focal adhesions. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified interactions between 5T4 and the membrane trafficking proteins Rab11, Rab18 and ARF6. Mechanistically we found that Rab11 and Rab18 have oppositional roles in controlling expression and surface presentation of 5T4. 5T4 depletion stabilizes Rab11 protein expression with a consequent stimulation transferrin surface labelling, indicating that 5T4 represses endocytic activity. Successful immunotherapeutic targeting of 5T4 requires surface presentation and different immunotherapy strategies require surface presentation versus endocytosis. While breast cancer cells with high 5T4 surface expression and rapid cell surface turnover would be susceptible to antibody-drug conjugates that rely on intracellular release, 5T4 positive cells with lower expression or lower turnover may still be responsive to T-cell mediated approaches. We find that endocytosis of 5T4 is strongly Rab11 dependent and as such Rab11 activity could affect the success or failure of 5T4-targetted immunotherapy, particularly for antibody-drug conjugate approaches. In fact, 5T4 itself represses Rab11 expression. This newly uncovered relationship between Rab11 and 5T4 suggests that breast tumours with high 5T4 expression may not have efficient endocytic uptake of 5T4-targetted immunotherapeutics. This should be considered when selecting amongst the different types of immunotherapies. Journal: The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology. Year: 2018.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Genome-wide analysis of immune system genes by expressed sequence Tag profiling.. Abstract: Profiling studies of mRNA and microRNA, particularly microarray-based studies, have been extensively used to create compendia of genes that are preferentially expressed in the immune system. In some instances, functional studies have been subsequently pursued. Recent efforts such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements have demonstrated the benefit of coupling RNA sequencing analysis with information from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for transcriptomic analysis. However, the full characterization and identification of transcripts that function as modulators of human immune responses remains incomplete. In this study, we demonstrate that an integrated analysis of human ESTs provides a robust platform to identify the immune transcriptome. Beyond recovering a reference set of immune-enriched genes and providing large-scale cross-validation of previous microarray studies, we discovered hundreds of novel genes preferentially expressed in the immune system, including noncoding RNAs. As a result, we have established the Immunogene database, representing an integrated EST road map of gene expression in human immune cells, which can be used to further investigate the function of coding and noncoding genes in the immune system. Using this approach, we have uncovered a unique metabolic gene signature of human macrophages and identified PRDM15 as a novel overexpressed gene in human lymphomas. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of EST profiling as a basis for further deconstruction of physiologic and pathologic immune processes. Journal: Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950).

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Advancements in lung cancer: molecular insights, innovative therapies, and future prospects.. Abstract: Still among the most common and deadly cancers worldwide, lung cancer causes major morbidity and death. Thanks to late-stage diagnosis, tumor heterogeneity, and resistance to traditional treatments, the prognosis for lung cancer patients is still poor even with developments in medical research. The disease is driven by a sophisticated interaction of environmental elements, genetic alterations, and lifestyle choices like smoking, air pollution, and occupational toxins. Key driver mutations like KRAS, EGFR, ALK, and TP53-which affect tumor development and response to therapy-have been found by advances in molecular oncology. Imaging techniques (CT, MRI, PET-CT), molecular diagnostics, and biopsy-based procedures increasing early detection and categorization have fundamentally changed diagnostic methodologies. Depending on tumor stage and molecular profile, treatment modalities including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have varied degrees of success. Still major problems, though, include systematic toxicity and treatment resistance. By improving therapeutic targeting and reducing unwanted effects, emerging drug delivery methods such liposomal formulations, nanoparticle-based carriers, and inhalable medicines present interesting substitutes. Moreover, customized medicine is being opened by gene therapy and RNA-based therapeutics like siRNA treatments and CRISpen/Cas9 gene editing. Integration of artificial intelligence (AI), exosome-based drug carriers, and 3D bioprinting to improve therapeutic accuracy will be the main topics of future study. Emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary approaches to increase survival rates and patient outcomes, this review investigates the etiology, molecular pathways, present therapy options, and developing discoveries in lung cancer research.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Salvage therapy in Hodgkin's lymphoma.. Abstract: Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a commonly cured malignancy. Unfortunately, patients who are refractory to or relapse after first-line treatment pose a significant therapeutic challenge. There is evidence that these patients are best treated with an approach involving salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDCT/ASCT). This approach may result in cure, with better results in patients with low-risk relapse. In patients with high-risk relapse and refractory disease, HDCT/ASCT is rarely curative. More aggressive transplant approaches have shown promising results in this group and are currently under active investigation. For those relapsing after HDCT/ASCT, there exists a range of therapeutic options, including further salvage chemotherapy, reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation, monoclonal antibody therapy, and novel agents. All patients in this category should be considered for enrollment in clinical trials. This review discusses the evidence behind the current practice in patients with relapsed or refractory HL. Specifically, the efficacy of various salvage chemotherapy regimens, the risk factors influencing outcome with HDCT/ASCT, and the results with alternative transplant approaches, monoclonal antibody therapies, and novel agents are addressed. We conclude by providing our approach to these patients, with the hope that this will serve as a framework for the practicing oncologist. Journal: The oncologist. Year: 2009.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Overcoming cold tumors: a combination strategy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.. Abstract: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) therapy has advanced significantly in treating malignant tumors, though most 'cold' tumors show no response. This resistance mainly arises from the varied immune evasion mechanisms. Hence, understanding the transformation from 'cold' to 'hot' tumors is essential in developing effective cancer treatments. Furthermore, tumor immune profiling is critical, requiring a range of diagnostic techniques and biomarkers for evaluation. The success of immunotherapy relies on T cells' ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. In 'cold' tumors, the absence of T cell infiltration leads to the ineffectiveness of ICI therapy. Addressing these challenges, especially the impairment in T cell activation and homing, is crucial to enhance ICI therapy's efficacy. Concurrently, strategies to convert 'cold' tumors into 'hot' ones, including boosting T cell infiltration and adoptive therapies such as T cell-recruiting bispecific antibodies and Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells, are under extensive exploration. Thus, identifying key factors that impact tumor T cell infiltration is vital for creating effective treatments targeting 'cold' tumors. Journal: Frontiers in immunology. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Metastatic relapse after treatment is the leading cause of cancer mortality, and known resistance mechanisms are missing for most treatments administered to patients. To bridge this gap, we analyze a pan-cancer cohort (META-PRISM) of 1,031 refractory metastatic tumors profiled via whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing. META-PRISM tumors, particularly prostate, bladder, and pancreatic types, displayed the most transformed genomes compared with primary untreated tumors. Standard-of-care resistance biomarkers were identified only in lung and colon cancers-9.6% of META-PRISM tumors, indicating that too few resistance mechanisms have received clinical validation. In contrast, we verified the enrichment of multiple investigational and hypothetical resistance mechanisms in treated compared with nontreated patients, thereby confirming their putative role in treatment resistance. Additionally, we demonstrated that molecular markers improve 6-month survival prediction, particularly in patients with advanced breast cancer. Our analysis establishes the utility of the META-PRISM cohort for investigating resistance mechanisms and performing predictive analyses in cancer. This study highlights the paucity of standard-of-care markers that explain treatment resistance and the promise of investigational and hypothetical markers awaiting further validation. It also demonstrates the utility of molecular profiling in advanced-stage cancers, particularly breast cancer, to improve the survival prediction and assess eligibility to phase I clinical trials.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Therapeutic targeting of the mitochondrial one-carbon pathway: perspectives, pitfalls, and potential.. Abstract: Most of the drugs currently prescribed for cancer treatment are riddled with substantial side effects. In order to develop more effective and specific strategies to treat cancer, it is of importance to understand the biology of drug targets, particularly the newly emerging ones. A comprehensive evaluation of these targets will benefit drug development with increased likelihood for success in clinical trials. The folate-mediated one-carbon (1C) metabolism pathway has drawn renewed attention as it is often hyperactivated in cancer and inhibition of this pathway displays promise in developing anticancer treatment with fewer side effects. Here, we systematically review individual enzymes in the 1C pathway and their compartmentalization to mitochondria and cytosol. Based on these insight, we conclude that (1) except the known 1C targets (DHFR, GART, and TYMS), MTHFD2 emerges as good drug target, especially for treating hematopoietic cancers such as CLL, AML, and T-cell lymphoma; (2) SHMT2 and MTHFD1L are potential drug targets; and (3) MTHFD2L and ALDH1L2 should not be considered as drug targets. We highlight MTHFD2 as an excellent therapeutic target and SHMT2 as a complementary target based on structural/biochemical considerations and up-to-date inhibitor development, which underscores the perspectives of their therapeutic potential.

Abstract: Renal cell cancer is among the most common forms of cancer in humans, with around 35,000 deaths attributed to kidney carcinoma in the European Union in 2012 alone. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) represents the most common form of kidney cancer and the most lethal of all genitourinary cancers. Here, we apply omics technologies to archival core biopsies to investigate the biology underlying ccRCC. Knowledge of these underlying processes should be useful for the discovery and/or confirmation of novel therapeutic approaches and ccRCC biomarker development. From partial or full nephrectomies of 11 patients, paired core biopsies of ccRCC-affected tissue and adjacent (\"peritumorous\") nontumor tissue were both sampled and subjected to proteomics analyses. We combined proteomics results with our published mRNA sequencing data from the same patients and with published miRNA sequencing data from an overlapping patient cohort from our institution. Statistical analysis and pathway analysis were performed with JMP Genomics and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), respectively. Proteomics analysis confirmed the involvement of metabolism and oxidative stress-related pathways in ccRCC, whereas the most affected pathways in the mRNA sequencing data were related to the immune system. Unlike proteomics or mRNA sequencing alone, a combinatorial cross-omics pathway analysis approach captured a broad spectrum of biological processes underlying ccRCC, such as mitochondrial damage, repression of apoptosis, and immune system pathways. Sirtuins, immunoproteasome genes, and CD74 are proposed as potential targets for the treatment of ccRCC. Journal: American journal of physiology. Renal physiology. Year: 2019.

Abstract: The biological programs of vertebrates exhibit a remarkable degree of functional degeneracy, adaptive compensation and robustness, to preserve homeostasis and generate reproducible phenotypic outputs irrespective of variations in signal strength, noise and quality. Cancers are difficult to treat not only because they are so mechanistically diverse but also because they adapt or evolve in response to any pharmacological elective pressure we impose upon them. Hence, an ideal cancer drug target would exert a function both necessary for cancer cell survival and functionally non-redundant, rendering it impossible for tumor cells to compensate for, or evolve independence from, the inhibitory effect of any drug aimed at that target. In this review, we discuss the unique, non-degenerate and highly pleiotropic role played by Myc in coordinating, engaging and maintaining the diverse intracellular and extracellular programs required for cell proliferation in vivo. These properties make Myc a compelling candidate cancer drug target, at least in principle: an assertion recently reinforced by new in vivo genetic data. Journal: Oncotarget. Year: 2011.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Where do we stand in the treatment of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia?. Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common and one of the most treatable cancers in children. Although the majority of children with ALL are now cured, 10%-20% of patients are predicted to relapse and outcomes with salvage therapy have been disappointing, with approximately only one-third of children surviving long-term after disease recurrence. Several prognostic factors have been identified, with timing of recurrence relative to diagnosis and site of relapse emerging as the most important variables. Despite heterogeneity in the elements of salvage therapy that are delivered in trials conducted internationally, outcomes have been remarkably similar and have remained static. Because most intensive salvage regimens have reached the limit of tolerability, current strategies are focusing on identifying new agents tailored to the unique biology of relapsed disease and identifying methods to develop these agents efficiently for clinical use. Recently, high-resolution genomic analyses of matched pairs of diagnostic and relapse bone marrow samples are emerging as a promising tool for identifying pathways that impart chemoresistance.

Abstract: Intratumoral heterogeneity is a well-documented feature of human cancers and is associated with outcome and treatment resistance. However, a heterogeneous tumor transcriptome contributes an unknown level of variability to analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may contribute to phenotypes of interest, including treatment response. Although current clinical practice and the vast majority of research studies use a single sample from each patient, decreasing costs of sequencing technologies and computing power have made repeated-measures analyses increasingly economical. Repeatedly sampling the same tumor increases the statistical power of DEG analysis, which is indispensable toward downstream analysis and also increases one's understanding of within-tumor variance, which may affect conclusions. Here, we compared five different methods for analyzing gene expression profiles derived from repeated sampling of human prostate tumors in two separate cohorts of patients. We also benchmarked the sensitivity of generalized linear models to linear mixed models for identifying DEGs contributing to relevant prostate cancer pathways based on a ground-truth model.

Abstract: Tumor-agnostic, or histology-agnostic, cancer therapy marks a groundbreaking evolution in the realm of precision oncology. In stark contrast to conventional cancer treatments that categorize malignancies based on their tissue of origin (eg, breast, lung, renal cell, etc), tumor-agnostic therapies transcend histologic boundaries, honing in on the genetic and molecular attributes of tumors, regardless of their location. This article offers a comprehensive review of the current landscape of tissue-agnostic cancer therapies and provides clinical insights to empower surgical oncologists with a deeper understanding of these innovative therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Metastasis is considered the major cause of unsuccessful cancer therapy. The metastatic development requires tumor cells to leave their initial site, circulate in the blood stream, acclimate to new cellular environments at a remote secondary site and endure there. There are several steps in metastasis, including invasion, intravasation, circulation, extravasation, premetastatic niche formation, micrometastasis and metastatic colonization. siRNA therapeutics are appreciated for their usefulness in treatment of cancer metastasis. However, siRNA therapy as a single therapy may not be a sufficient option for control of metastasis. By combining siRNA with targeting, functional agents or small-molecule drugs have shown potential effects that enhance therapeutic effectiveness. This review addresses multidrug resistance and metastasis in breast and ovarian cancers and highlights drug-delivery strategies using siRNA therapeutics. Journal: Nanomedicine (London, England).

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Agnostic Administration of Targeted Anticancer Drugs: Looking for a Balance between Hype and Caution.. Abstract: Many tumors have well-defined vulnerabilities, thus potentially allowing highly specific and effective treatment. There is a spectrum of actionable genetic alterations which are shared across various tumor types and, therefore, can be targeted by a given drug irrespective of tumor histology. Several agnostic drug-target matches have already been approved for clinical use, e.g., immune therapy for tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or high tumor mutation burden (TMB), NTRK1-3 and RET inhibitors for cancers carrying rearrangements in these kinases, and dabrafenib plus trametinib for <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutated malignancies. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that this histology-independent approach is also reasonable for tumors carrying <i>ALK</i> and <i>ROS1</i> translocations, biallelic <i>BRCA1/2</i> inactivation and/or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), strong <i>HER2</i> amplification/overexpression coupled with the absence of other MAPK pathway-activating mutations, etc. On the other hand, some well-known targets are not agnostic: for example, PD-L1 expression is predictive for the efficacy of PD-L1/PD1 inhibitors only in some but not all cancer types. Unfortunately, the individual probability of finding a druggable target in a given tumor is relatively low, even with the use of comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays. Nevertheless, the rapidly growing utilization of NGS will significantly increase the number of patients with highly unusual or exceptionally rare tumor-target combinations. Clinical trials may provide only a framework for treatment attitudes, while the decisions for individual patients usually require case-by-case consideration of the probability of deriving benefit from agnostic versus standard therapy, drug availability, associated costs, and other circumstances. The existing format of data dissemination may not be optimal for agnostic cancer medicine, as conventional scientific journals are understandably biased towards the publication of positive findings and usually discourage the submission of case reports. Despite all the limitations and concerns, histology-independent drug-target matching is certainly feasible and, therefore, will be increasingly utilized in the future.

Abstract: Melittin is a water-soluble cationic peptide derived from bee venom that has been thoroughly studied for the cure of different cancers. However, the unwanted interactions of melittin produce hemolytic and cytotoxic effects that hinder their therapeutic applications. To overcome the shortcomings, numerous research groups have adopted different approaches, including conjugation with tumor-targeting proteins, gene therapy, and encapsulation in nanoparticles, to reduce the non-specific cytotoxic effects and potentiate their anti-cancerous activity. This article aims to provide mechanistic insights into the chemopreventive activity of melittin and its nanoversion in combination with standard anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of cancer. We looked over the pertinent research on melittin's chemopreventive properties in online databases such as PubMed and Scopus. In the present article, the anti-cancerous effects of melittin on different cancers have been discussed very nicely, as have their possible mechanisms of action to act against different tumors. Besides, it interacts with different signal molecules that regulate the diverse pathways of cancerous cells, such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. We also discussed the recent progress in the synergistic combination of melittin with standard anti-cancer drugs and a nano-formulated version of melittin for targeted delivery to improve its anticancer potential.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: A jack of all trades - ADAM8 as a signaling hub in inflammation and cancer.. Abstract: As a member of the family of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinases (ADAM) ADAM8 is preferentially expressed in lymphatic organs, immune cells, and tumor cells. The substrate spectrum for ADAM8 proteolytic activity is not exclusive but is related to effectors of inflammation and signaling in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, complexes of ADAM8 with extracellular binding partners such as integrin \u03b2-1 cause an extensive intracellular signaling in tumor cells, thereby activating kinase pathways with STAT3, ERK1/2, and Akt signaling, which causes increased cell survival and enhanced motility. The cytoplasmic domain of ADAM8 harbors five SRC homology-3 (SH3) domains that can potentially interact with several proteins involved in actin dynamics and cell motility, including Myosin 1F (MYO1F), which is essential for neutrophil motility. The concept of ADAM8 thus involves immune cell recruitment, in most cases leading to an enhancement of inflammatory (asthma, COPD) and tumor (including pancreatic and breast cancers) pathologies. In this review, we report on available studies that qualify ADAM8 as a therapeutic target in different pathologies. As a signaling hub, ADAM8 controls extracellular, intracellular, and intercellular communication, the latter one mainly mediated by the release of extracellular vesicles with ADAM8 as cargo. Here, we will dissect the contribution of different domains to these distinct ways of communication in several pathologies. We conclude that therapeutic targeting attempts for ADAM8 should consider blocking more than a single domain and that this requires a thorough evaluation of potent molecules targeting ADAM8 in an in vivo setting.

Abstract: Treatment on risk adapted intensive pediatric protocols has improved outcome for teenagers and young adults (TYA) with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Understanding the biology of disease in this age group and the genetic basis of relapse is a key goal as patients with relapsed/refractory disease have poor outcomes with conventional chemotherapy and novel molecular targets are required. This study examines the question of whether TYA T-ALL has a specific biological-molecular profile distinct from pediatric or adult T-ALL. Genomic characterization was undertaken of a retrospective discovery cohort of 80 patients aged 15-26 years with primary or relapsed T-ALL, using a combination of Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0, targeted gene mutation and promoter methylation analyses. Findings were confirmed by MLPA, real-time quantitative PCR, and FISH. Whole Exome Sequencing was performed in 4 patients with matched presentation and relapse to model clonal evolution. A prevalence analysis was performed on a final data set of 1,792 individual cases to identify genetic lesions with age specific frequency patterns, including 972 pediatric (1-14 years), 439 TYA (15-24 years) and 381 adult (\u226525 years) cases. These cases were extracted from 19 publications with comparable genomic data identified through a PubMed search. Genomic characterization of this large cohort of TYA T-ALL patients identified recurrent isochromosome 7q i(7q) in our discovery cohort (n = 3). Prevalence analysis did not identify any age specific genetic abnormalities. Genomic analysis of 6 pairs of matched presentation - relapsed T-ALL established that all relapses were clonally related to the initial leukemia. Whole exome sequencing analysis revealed recurrent, targetable, mutations disrupting NOTCH, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, FLT3, NRAS as well as drug metabolism pathways. All genetic aberrations in TYA T-ALL occurred with an incidence similar or intermediate to that reported in the pediatric and adult literature, demonstrating that overall TYA T-ALL exhibits a transitional genomic profile. Analysis of matched presentation - relapse supported the hypothesis that relapse is driven by the Darwinian evolution of sub-clones associated with drug resistance (NT5C2 and TP53 mutations) and re-iterative mutation of known key T-ALL drivers, including NOTCH1.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The role of MAPK pathway in gastric cancer: unveiling molecular crosstalk and therapeutic prospects.. Abstract: Gastric cancer remains a significant health burden globally, especially prevalent in Asian and European regions. Despite a notable decline in incidence in the United States and Western Europe over recent decades, the disease's persistence underscores the urgency for advanced research in its pathogenesis and treatment strategies. Central to this pursuit is the exploration of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, a pivotal cellular mechanism implicated in the complex processes of gastric cancer development, including cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and metastasis. The MAPK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway serves as a crucial conduit for transmitting extracellular signals to elicit intracellular responses, with its signaling cascades subject to alterations due to genetic and epigenetic variations across various diseases, prominently cancer. This review delves into the intricate role of the MAPK signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer, drawing upon the most recent and critical studies that shed light on MAPK pathway alterations as a gateway to the disease. It highlights the pathway's involvement in Helicobacter pylori-mediated gastric carcinogenesis and the tumorigenic processes induced by the Epstein-Barr virus, showcasing the substantial influence of miRNAs and lncRNAs in modulating gastric cancer's biological properties through their interaction with the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, the review extends into the therapeutic arena, discussing the promising impacts of herbal medicines, MAPK pathway inhibitors, and immunosuppressants on mitigating gastric cancer's progression. Through an exhaustive examination of the MAPK pathway's multifaceted role in gastric cancer, from molecular crosstalks to therapeutic prospects, this review aspires to contribute to the ongoing efforts in understanding and combating this global health challenge, paving the way for novel therapeutic interventions and improved patient outcomes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: PI3K and tankyrase inhibitors as therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer.. Abstract: The pathways like Wingless-related integration (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin) and PI3K play an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) development; however, their roles are distinct in the process of oncogenesis. Despite their differences, these pathways interact through feedback mechanisms and regulate the common effectors both in the upstream and the downstream processes in normal and pathological conditions. Their ability to reciprocally control each other is a primary resistance mechanism for the selective inhibitors in CRC. This review highlights the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and PI3K pathways that are interrelated in CRC, recent advances and some key perspectives in developing inhibitors that could target the tankyrase enzyme and PI3K, apart from a brief description of the potential of dual inhibitors of PI3K and Tankyrases (TNKS). Recent research has focused on overcoming the challenges particularly relating to the resistance and efficacy of dual inhibitors targeting PI3K and tankyrase proteins. Despite these challenges, PI3K as well as tankyrases remain promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of solid tumors. The design of potent inhibitors is crucial to effectively block these protein signaling pathways. Moreover, it is essential to explore the potential of dual-target inhibition of other signaling pathways in conjunction with PI3K and tankyrase. Journal: Expert opinion on therapeutic targets.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Multiplatform genomic profiling and magnetic resonance imaging identify mechanisms underlying intratumor heterogeneity in meningioma.. Abstract: Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors, but the molecular drivers of meningioma tumorigenesis are poorly understood. We hypothesized that investigating intratumor heterogeneity in meningiomas would elucidate biologic drivers and reveal new targets for molecular therapy. To test this hypothesis, here we perform multiplatform molecular profiling of 86 spatially-distinct samples from 13 human meningiomas. Our data reveal that regional alterations in chromosome structure underlie clonal transcriptomic, epigenomic, and histopathologic signatures in meningioma. Stereotactic co-registration of sample coordinates to preoperative magnetic resonance images further suggest that high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) distinguishes meningioma regions with proliferating cells enriched for developmental gene expression programs. To understand the function of these genes in meningioma, we develop a human cerebral organoid model of meningioma and validate the high ADC marker genes CDH2 and PTPRZ1 as potential targets for meningioma therapy using live imaging, single cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR interference, and pharmacology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: NAD- and NADPH-Contributing Enzymes as Therapeutic Targets in Cancer: An Overview.. Abstract: Actively proliferating cancer cells require sufficient amount of NADH and NADPH for biogenesis and to protect cells from the detrimental effect of reactive oxygen species. As both normal and cancer cells share the same NAD biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, selectively lowering levels of NAD(H) and NADPH would be a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Targeting nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a rate limiting enzyme of the NAD salvage pathway, affects the NAD and NADPH pool. Similarly, lowering NADPH by mutant <i>isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2</i> (<i>IDH1/2</i>) which produces D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), an oncometabolite that downregulates nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) via hypermethylation on the promoter region, results in epigenetic regulation. NADPH is used to generate D-2HG, and is also needed to protect dihydrofolate reductase, the target for methotrexate, from degradation. NAD and NADPH pools in various cancer types are regulated by several metabolic enzymes, including methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Thus, targeting NAD and NADPH synthesis under special circumstances is a novel approach to treat some cancers. This article provides the rationale for targeting the key enzymes that maintain the NAD/NADPH pool, and reviews preclinical studies of targeting these enzymes in cancers. Journal: Biomolecules.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Exceptional response to the ALK and ROS1 inhibitor lorlatinib and subsequent mechanism of resistance in relapsed <i>ALK</i> F1174L-mutated neuroblastoma.. Abstract: Treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma typically incorporates multiagent chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, immunotherapy, and differentiation therapy. The discovery of activating mutations in ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (<i>ALK</i>) in \u223c8% of neuroblastomas opens the possibility of further improving outcomes for this subset of patients with the addition of ALK inhibitors. ALK inhibitors have shown efficacy in tumors such as non-small-cell lung cancer and anaplastic large cell lymphoma in which wild-type ALK overexpression is driven by translocation events. In contrast, ALK mutations driving neuroblastomas are missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain yielding constitutive activation and differing sensitivity to available ALK inhibitors. We describe a case of a patient with relapsed, refractory, metastatic <i>ALK</i> F1174L-mutated neuroblastoma who showed no response to the first-generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib but had a subsequent complete response to the ALK/ROS1 inhibitor lorlatinib. The patient's disease relapsed after 13 mo of treatment. Sequencing of cell-free DNA at the time of relapse pointed toward a potential mechanism of acquired lorlatinib resistance: amplification of <i>CDK4</i> and <i>FGFR1</i> and a <i>NRAS</i> Q61K mutation. We review the literature regarding differing sensitivity of <i>ALK</i> mutations found in neuroblastoma to current FDA-approved ALK inhibitors and known pathways of acquired resistance. Our report adds to the literature of important correlations between neuroblastoma <i>ALK</i> mutation status and clinical responsiveness to ALK inhibitors. It also highlights the importance of understanding acquired mechanisms of resistance. Journal: Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies. Year: 2021.

Abstract: An evaluation of the expression and predictive significance of the <i>MDM2</i> gene in brain lower-grade glioma (LGG) cancer was carried out using onco-informatics pipelines. Several transcriptome servers were used to measure the differential expression of the targeted <i>MDM2</i> gene and search mutations and copy number variations. GENT2, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Onco-Lnc, and PrognoScan were used to figure out the survival rate of LGG cancer patients. The protein-protein interaction networks between <i>MDM2</i> gene and its co-expressed genes were constructed by Gene-MANIA tool. Identified bioactive phytochemicals were evaluated through molecular docking using Schr\u00f6dinger Suite Software, with the MDM2 (PDB ID: 1RV1) target. Protein-ligand interactions were observed with key residues of the macromolecular target. A molecular dynamics simulation of the novel bioactive compounds with the targeted protein was performed. Phytochemicals targeting MDM2 protein, such as Taxifolin and (-)-Epicatechin, have been shown with more highly stable results as compared to the control drug, and hence, concluded that phytochemicals with bioactive potential might be alternative therapeutic options for the management of LGG patients. Our once informatics-based designed pipeline has indicated that the <i>MDM2</i> gene may have been a predictive biomarker for LGG cancer and selected phytochemicals possessed outstanding interaction results within the macromolecular target's active site after utilizing in silico approaches. In vitro and in vivo experiments are recommended to confirm these outcomes. Journal: Molecules (Basel, Switzerland). Year: 2023. Authors: Biswas P, Bibi S, Yousafi Q, Mehmood A, Saleem S.

Abstract: Whole-genome sequencing has revealed MYD88 L265P and CXCR4 mutations (CXCR4(mut)) as the most prevalent somatic mutations in Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia. CXCR4 mutation has proved to be of critical importance in Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, in part due to its role as a mechanism of resistance to several agents. We have therefore sought to unravel the different aspects of CXCR4 mutations in Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia. We have scanned the two coding exons of CXCR4 in Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia using deep next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing in 98 patients with Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia and correlated with SNP array landscape and mutational spectrum of eight candidate genes involved in TLR, RAS, and BCR pathway in an integrative study. We found all mutations to be heterozygous, somatic, and located in the C-terminal domain of CXCR4 in 25% of the Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia. CXCR4 mutations led to a truncated receptor protein associated with a higher expression of CXCR4. CXCR4 mutations pertain to the same clone as to MYD88 L265P mutations but were mutually exclusive to CD79A/CD79B mutations (BCR pathway). We identified a genomic signature in CXCR4(mut) Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia traducing a more complex genome. CXCR4 mutations were also associated with gain of chromosome 4, gain of Xq, and deletion 6q. Our study panned out new CXCR4 mutations in Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia and identified a specific signature associated to CXCR4(mut), characterized with complex genomic aberrations among MYD88L265P Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia. Our results suggest the existence of various genomic subgroups in Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Comparative profiling of single-cell transcriptome reveals heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment between solid and acinar lung adenocarcinoma.. Abstract: The diversity of histologic composition reflects the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) macroscopically. Insights into the oncological characteristics and tumor microenvironment (TME) of different histologic subtypes of LUAD at the single-cell level can help identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities and combinational approaches to improve the survival of LUAD patients. Through comparative profiling of cell communities defined by scRNA-seq data, we characterized the TME of LUAD samples of distinct histologic subtypes, with relevant results further confirmed in multiple bulk transcriptomic, proteomic datasets and an independent immunohistochemical validation cohort. We find that the hypoxic and acidic situation is the worst in the TME of solid LUADs compared to other histologic subtypes. Besides, the tumor metabolic preferences vary across histologic subtypes and may correspondingly impinge on the metabolism and function of immune cells. Remarkably, tumor cells from solid LUADs upregulate energy and substance metabolic activities, particularly the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism and the key gene MTHFD2, which could serve as a potential therapeutic target. Additionally, ubiquitination modifications may also be involved in the progression of histologic patterns. Immunologically, solid LUADs are characterized by a predominance of exhausted T cells and immunosuppressive myeloid cells, where the hypoxic, acidified and nutrient-deprived TME has a non-negligible impact. Discrepancies in stromal cell function, evidenced by varying degrees of stromal remodeling and fibrosis, may also contribute to the specific immune phenotype of solid LUADs. Overall, our research proposes several potential entry points to improve the immunosuppressive TME of solid LUADs, thereby synergistically potentiating their immunotherapeutic efficacy, and may provide precise therapeutic strategies for LUAD patients of distinct histologic subtype constitution.

Abstract: Trabectedin\u00a0+\u00a0pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) offers a well tolerated and effective nonplatinum, nontaxane alternative for treatment of ovarian cancer patients with a treatment-free interval after platinum beyond 6\u00a0months, especially for those relapsing between 6 and 12\u00a0months and those who are not candidates to receive platinum-based therapy. Using the nonplatinum trabectedin\u00a0+\u00a0PLD combination gives patients time to recover from platinum-related toxicities and may restore platinum sensitivity in tumor cells. The sequence effect, by which intercalation of trabectedin\u00a0+\u00a0PLD between platinum regimens may enhance the activity of next platinum and improve survival, is currently under investigation in the Phase III prospective INternational OVArian cancer patients Trial with YONdelis.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 is a zinc-dependent proteinase that is capable of cleaving all extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates. Degradation of the matrix is a key event in the progression, invasion, and metastasis of potentially malignant and malignant lesions of the head and neck. Therefore, blocking MMP-2 expression or activity may present a promising strategy for anticancer treatment. Current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern MMP-2 regulation and its tumorigenic effects, and that are involved in the initiation and progression of head and neck cancers, in particular the emerging role of MMP-2 in cell migration, which is a prerequisite for tumor metastasis. MMP-2 gene polymorphisms, cellular substrates, and interacting proteins are summarized. The current state of drugs that target this enzyme, either alone or in combination with other targeted agents are also discussed. MMP-2 has long been a drug target. The current status of MMP-2 inhibitors as anticancer agents and their failure in the clinic is discussed in light of new data on the MMP-2s role as a cell surface transducer - data that may lead to the design and development of novel, MMP-2-targeting inhibitors.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases that result from the accumulation of different sets of genomic alterations, together with epigenomic alterations, and it is influenced by tumor-host interactions, leading to tumor cell growth and glycolytic imbalances. This review summarizes recent findings that involve multiple signaling molecules and downstream genes in the dysregulated glycolytic pathway. This paper further discusses the role of the dysregulated glycolytic pathway in the tumor initiation, progression and the concomitant systemic immunosuppression commonly observed in colorectal cancer patients. Moreover, the relationship between colorectal cancer cells and T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, is discussed, while different aspects of metabolic pathway regulation in cancer cell proliferation are comprehensively defined. Furthermore, this study elaborates on metabolism in colorectal cancer, specifically key metabolic modulators together with regulators, glycolytic enzymes, and glucose deprivation induced by tumor cells and how they inhibit T-cell glycolysis and immunogenic functions. Moreover, metabolic pathways that are integral to T cell function, differentiation, and activation are described. Selective metabolic inhibitors or immunemodulation agents targeting these pathways may be clinically useful to increase effector T cell responses for colorectal cancer treatment. However, there is a need to identify specific antigens using a cancer patient-personalized approach and combination strategies with other therapeutic agents to effectively target tumor metabolic pathways.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Multi-omic-based classification for identifying optimal neoadjuvant treatment strategies for high-risk early-stage breast cancer.. Abstract: Neoadjuvant therapies are essential for managing high-risk early-stage breast cancer, but their effectiveness is limited, necessitating the exploration of the optimal neoadjuvant treatment strategy based on innovative subtypes. Given the heterogeneity inherent in breast cancer, there is growing need for identifying novel molecular subtypes predictive of treatment response through multi-omic analyses. A comprehensive analysis was performed using data from 142 high-risk early breast cancer patients, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic profiles. The molecular subtypes were explored based on the biological characteristics and responses to neoadjuvant treatments. The results were also validated in the TCGA-breast cancer cohort and external dataset. Three molecular subtypes were identified, each associated with different optimal treatment strategies. The immune-activated (IA) subtype displayed a significantly higher pathologic complete response (pCR) rate when treated with platinum-based neoadjuvant regimens, and exhibited heightened immune cell infiltration. The vesicular transport pathway-activated (VT) subtype, characterized by vesicular transport pathway activation, showed a favorable pCR rate to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast, the kinase activation (KA) subtype demonstrated limited responsiveness to both platinum and anthracycline-based treatments and featured enrichment in non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling, MAPK/ATM kinase activation, and angiogenic signatures. A seven-gene classifier linked to non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling was created to identify the KA subtype, achieving an area under the curve value of 90%. The drug vulnerability of breast cancer cells within the KA subtype indicated potential therapeutic effectiveness of ATR/ATM inhibitors and anti-angiogenic agents. This study defined three novel molecular subtypes in high-risk early-stage breast cancer patients and provided optimal therapeutic treatment strategies based on these subtypes. Therefore, important insights about intrinsic biological properties can form the basis for new cancer treatment strategies. Journal: Science China. Life sciences. Year: 2025.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Genomic Analysis of Vascular Invasion in HCC Reveals Molecular Drivers and Predictive Biomarkers.. Abstract: Vascular invasion (VI) is a critical risk factor for HCC recurrence and poor survival. The molecular drivers of vascular invasion in HCC are open for investigation. Deciphering the molecular landscape of invasive HCC will help identify therapeutic targets and noninvasive biomarkers. To this end, we undertook this study to evaluate the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profile of tumors with VI using the multiplatform cancer genome atlas (The Cancer Genome Atlas; TCGA) data (n\u00a0=\u00a0373). In the TCGA Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma cohort, macrovascular invasion was present in 5% (n\u00a0=\u00a017) of tumors and microvascular invasion in 25% (n\u00a0=\u00a094) of tumors. Functional pathway analysis revealed that the MYC oncogene was a common upstream regulator of the mRNA, miRNA, and proteomic changes in VI. We performed comparative proteomic analyses of invasive human HCC and MYC-driven murine HCC and identified fibronectin to be a proteomic biomarker of invasive HCC (mouse fibronectin 1 [Fn1], P\u00a0=\u00a01.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-11</sup> ; human FN1, P\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup> ) conserved across the two species. Mechanistically, we show that FN1 promotes the migratory and invasive phenotype of HCC cancer cells. We demonstrate tissue overexpression of fibronectin in human HCC using a large independent cohort of human HCC tissue microarray (n\u00a0=\u00a0153; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Lastly, we showed that plasma fibronectin levels were significantly elevated in patients with HCC (n\u00a0=\u00a035; mean\u00a0=\u00a0307.7 \u03bcg/mL; SEM = 35.9) when compared to cirrhosis (n\u00a0=\u00a010; mean\u00a0=\u00a041.8 \u03bcg/mL; SEM = 13.3; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Our study evaluates the molecular landscape of tumors with VI, identifying distinct transcriptional, epigenetic, and proteomic changes driven by the MYC oncogene. We show that MYC up-regulates fibronectin expression, which promotes HCC invasiveness. In addition, we identify fibronectin to be a promising noninvasive proteomic biomarker of VI in HCC.

Abstract: Colorectal and lung cancers account for one-third of all cancer-related deaths worldwide. Previous studies suggested that metadherin (MTDH) is involved in the development of colorectal and lung cancers. However, how MTDH regulates the pathogenesis of these cancers remains largely unknown. Using genetically modified mouse models of spontaneous colorectal and lung cancers, we found that MTDH promotes cancer progression by facilitating Wnt activation and by inducing cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion, respectively. Moreover, we developed locked nucleic acid-modified (LNA) MTDH antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that effectively and specifically suppress MTDH expression <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Treatments with MTDH ASOs in mouse models significantly attenuated progression and metastasis of colorectal, lung, and breast cancers. Our study opens a new avenue for developing therapies against colorectal and lung cancers by targeting MTDH using LNA-modified ASO. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides new insights into the mechanism of MTDH in promoting colorectal and lung cancers, as well as genetic and pharmacologic evidence supporting the development of MTDH-targeting therapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Insight into RNA-based Therapies for Ovarian Cancer.. Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most common malignancies in women and is associated with poor outcomes. The treatment for OC is often associated with resistance to therapies and hence this has stimulated the search for alternative therapeutic approaches, including RNA-based therapeutics. However, this approach has some challenges that include RNA degradation. To solve this critical issue, some novel delivery systems have been proposed. In current years, there has been growing interest in the improvement of RNAbased therapeutics as a promising approach to target ovarian cancer and improve patient outcomes. This paper provides a practical insight into the use of RNA-based therapeutics in ovarian cancers, highlighting their potential benefits, challenges, and current research progress. RNA-based therapeutics offer a novel and targeted approach to treat ovarian cancer by exploiting the unique characteristics of RNA molecules. By targeting key oncogenes or genes responsible for drug resistance, siRNAs can effectively inhibit tumor growth and sensitize cancer cells to conventional therapies. Furthermore, messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have emerged as a revolutionary tool in cancer immunotherapy. MRNA vaccines can be designed to encode tumor-specific antigens, stimulating the immune system to distinguish and eliminate ovarian cancer cells. A nano-based delivery platform improves the release of loaded RNAs to the target location and reduces the off-target effects. Additionally, off-target effects and immune responses triggered by RNA molecules necessitate careful design and optimization of these therapeutics. Several preclinical and clinical researches have shown promising results in the field of RNA-based therapeutics for ovarian cancer. In a preclinical study, siRNA-mediated silencing of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) gene, involved in DNA repair, sensitized ovarian cancer cells to PARP inhibitors, leading to enhanced therapeutic efficacy. In clinical trials, mRNA-based vaccines targeting tumor-associated antigens have demonstrated safety and efficacy in stimulating immune responses in ovarian cancer patients. In aggregate, RNA-based therapeutics represent a promising avenue for the therapy of ovarian cancers. The ability to specifically target oncogenes or stimulate immune responses against tumor cells holds great potential for improving patient outcomes. However, further research is needed to address challenges related to delivery, permanence, and off-target effects. Clinical trials assessing the care and effectiveness of RNAbased therapeutics in larger patient cohorts are warranted. With continued advancements in the field, RNAbased therapeutics have the potential to develop the management of ovarian cancer and provide new hope for patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cancer genomics predicts disease relapse and therapeutic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of hormone sensitive breast cancers.. Abstract: Several studies provide insight into the landscape of breast cancer genomics with the genomic characterization of tumors offering exceptional opportunities in defining therapies tailored to the patient's specific need. However, translating genomic data into personalized treatment regimens has been hampered partly due to uncertainties in deviating from guideline based clinical protocols. Here we report a genomic approach to predict favorable outcome to treatment responses thus enabling personalized medicine in the selection of specific treatment regimens. The genomic data were divided into a training set of N\u2009=\u2009835 cases and a validation set consisting of 1315 hormone sensitive, 634 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 1365 breast cancer patients with information on neoadjuvant chemotherapy responses. Patients were selected by the following criteria: estrogen receptor (ER) status, lymph node invasion, recurrence free survival. The k-means classification algorithm delineated clusters with low- and high- expression of genes related to recurrence of disease; a multivariate Cox's proportional hazard model defined recurrence risk for disease. Classifier genes were validated by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using tissue microarray sections containing both normal and cancerous tissues and by evaluating findings deposited in the human protein atlas repository. Based on the leave-on-out cross validation procedure of 4 independent data sets we identified 51-genes associated with disease relapse and selected 10, i.e. TOP2A, AURKA, CKS2, CCNB2, CDK1 SLC19A1, E2F8, E2F1, PRC1, KIF11 for in depth validation. Expression of the mechanistically linked disease regulated genes significantly correlated with recurrence free survival among ER-positive and triple negative breast cancer patients and was independent of age, tumor size, histological grade and node status. Importantly, the classifier genes predicted pathological complete responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u20090.001) with high expression of these genes being associated with an improved therapeutic response toward two different anthracycline-taxane regimens; thus, highlighting the prospective for precision medicine. Our study demonstrates the potential of classifier genes to predict risk for disease relapse and treatment response to chemotherapies. The classifier genes enable rational selection of patients who benefit best from a given chemotherapy thus providing the best possible care. The findings encourage independent clinical validation.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Circulating ESR1 mutations at the end of aromatase inhibitor adjuvant treatment and after relapse in breast cancer patients.. Abstract: Detection of circulating ESR1 mutations is associated with acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitor (AI) in metastatic breast cancer. Until now, the presence of circulating ESR1 mutations at the end of adjuvant treatment by AI in early breast cancer had never been clearly established. In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the circulating ESR1 mutation frequency at the end of adjuvant treatment and after relapse. This monocentric retrospective study was based on available stored plasmas and included all early breast cancer patients who completed at least 2\u00a0years of AI adjuvant treatment and experienced a documented relapse after the end of their treatment. Circulating ESR1 mutations (D538G, Y537S/N/C) were assessed by droplet digital PCR in plasma samples taken at the end of adjuvant treatment, at time of relapse and at time of progression under first line metastatic treatment. A total of 42 patients were included, with a median adjuvant AI exposure of 60\u00a0months (range 41-85). No circulating ESR1 mutation was detectable at the end of AI adjuvant therapy. At first relapse, 5.3% of the patients (2/38) had a detectable circulating ESR1 mutation. At time of progression on first-line metastatic treatment, 33% of the patients (7/21) under AI had a detectable circulating ESR1 mutation compared to none of the patients under chemotherapy (0/10). The two patients with a detectable ESR1 mutation at relapse were treated by AI and had an increase of their variant allele fraction at time of progression on first-line metastatic treatment. Circulating ESR1 mutation detection at the end of AI-based adjuvant treatment is not clinically useful. Circulating ESR1 mutation could be assessed as soon as first relapse to guide interventional studies. Journal: Breast cancer research : BCR. Year: 2018.

Abstract: Although the majority of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma are cured with initial therapy, 10% to 15% of patients with early stage disease and 15% to 30% of patients with advanced disease have primary refractory or relapsed lymphoma. For younger patients whose disease is sensitive to second-line therapy, more than half of patients will experience long-term disease control with high-dose chemotherapy/autologous stem cell rescue (ASCT). For those patients who are chemotherapy refractory, relapse after, or are ineligible for ASCT, brentuximab vedotin, and checkpoint, inhibitors are highly active, although the majority of patients will ultimately experience recurrent lymphoma. Allogeneic transplant is curative in a subset of patients but may be associated with significant toxicity. Novel targeted and immunotherapy approaches, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, are currently being studied in clinical trials with promising early results.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: TET2 controls chemoresistant slow-cycling cancer cell survival and tumor recurrence.. Abstract: Dormant or slow-cycling tumor cells can form a residual chemoresistant reservoir responsible for relapse in patients, years after curative surgery and adjuvant therapy. We have adapted the pulse-chase expression of H2BeGFP for labeling and isolating slow-cycling cancer cells (SCCCs). SCCCs showed cancer initiation potential and enhanced chemoresistance. Cells at this slow-cycling status presented a distinctive nongenetic and cell-autonomous gene expression profile shared across different tumor types. We identified TET2 epigenetic enzyme as a key factor controlling SCCC numbers, survival, and tumor recurrence. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), generated by TET2 enzymatic activity, labeled the SCCC genome in carcinomas and was a predictive biomarker of relapse and survival in cancer patients. We have shown the enhanced chemoresistance of SCCCs and revealed 5hmC as a biomarker for their clinical identification and TET2 as a potential drug target for SCCC elimination that could extend patients' survival.

Abstract: Cancer immunotherapy has changed the therapeutic landscape for multiple types of cancer, yet a majority of patients do not respond or develop resistance. Dysregulated activation of oncogenic signalling pathways can lead to tumour immune evasion and the creation of an immunosuppressive \"cold\" tumour microenvironment, contributing to resistance to immunotherapy. Research indicates that targeting these oncogenic pathways can enhance antitumour immune responses and convert \"cold\" tumours into \"hot\" ones, thereby improving the efficacy of immunotherapy. This review summarizes the recent advance of oncogenic signalling on tumour immune evasion and the formation of a \"cold\" tumour microenvironment. It also summarizes the mechanisms by which targeting oncogenic signalling pathways to enhance antitumour immunity and its effects on cancer immunotherapy. Additionally, therapeutic targets and agents for oncogenic signalling pathways, along with drug-target structural binding mechanisms, are summarized in this study. Relevant clinical trials involving the combination of oncogenic pathway inhibitor and cancer immunotherapy are reviewed. Finally, we discuss the current status and challenges of targeting oncogenic signalling pathways to enhance immunotherapy and outlined potential future research directions based on current findings.

Abstract: To better understand prostate function and disease, it is important to define and explore the molecular constituents that signify the prostate gland. The aim of this study was to define the prostate specific transcriptome and proteome, in comparison to 26 other human tissues. Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling were combined to identify prostate specific gene expression patterns and to explore tissue biomarkers for potential clinical use in prostate cancer diagnostics. We identified 203 genes with elevated expression in the prostate, 22 of which showed more than five-fold higher expression levels compared to all other tissue types. In addition to previously well-known proteins we identified two poorly characterized proteins, TMEM79 and ACOXL, with potential to differentiate between benign and cancerous prostatic glands in tissue biopsies. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the prostate specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling to identify genes with elevated expression in the prostate. Our data provides a starting point for further functional studies to explore the molecular repertoire of normal and diseased prostate including potential prostate cancer markers such as TMEM79 and ACOXL.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Mitochondrial Flexibility of Breast Cancers: A Growth Advantage and a Therapeutic Opportunity.. Abstract: Breast cancers are very heterogeneous tissues with several cell types and metabolic pathways together sustaining the initiation and progression of disease and contributing to evasion from cancer therapies. Furthermore, breast cancer cells have an impressive metabolic plasticity that is regulated by the heterogeneous tumour microenvironment through bidirectional interactions. The structure and accessibility of nutrients within this unstable microenvironment influence the metabolism of cancer cells that shift between glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In this scenario, the mitochondrial energetic pathways of cancer cells can be reprogrammed to modulate breast cancer's progression and aggressiveness. Moreover, mitochondrial alterations can lead to crosstalk between the mitochondria and the nucleus, and subsequently affect cancer tissue properties. This article reviewed the metabolic plasticity of breast cancer cells, focussing mainly on breast cancer mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming and the mitochondrial alterations influencing nuclear pathways. Finally, the therapeutic strategies targeting molecules and pathways regulating cancer mitochondrial alterations are highlighted. Journal: Cells. Year: 2019.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Functional Precision Medicine Identifies Novel Druggable Targets and Therapeutic Options in Head and Neck Cancer.. Abstract: <b>Purpose:</b> Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with high mortality and a lack of targeted therapies. To identify and prioritize druggable targets, we performed genome analysis together with genome-scale siRNA and oncology drug profiling using low-passage tumor cells derived from a patient with treatment-resistant HPV-negative HNSCC.<b>Experimental Design:</b> A tumor cell culture was established and subjected to whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, comparative genome hybridization, and high-throughput phenotyping with a siRNA library covering the druggable genome and an oncology drug library. Secondary screens of candidate target genes were performed on the primary tumor cells and two nontumorigenic keratinocyte cell cultures for validation and to assess cancer specificity. siRNA screens of the kinome on two isogenic pairs of p53-mutated HNSCC cell lines were used to determine generalizability. Clinical utility was addressed by performing drug screens on two additional HNSCC cell cultures derived from patients enrolled in a clinical trial.<b>Results:</b> Many of the identified copy number aberrations and somatic mutations in the primary tumor were typical of HPV(-) HNSCC, but none pointed to obvious therapeutic choices. In contrast, siRNA profiling identified 391 candidate target genes, 35 of which were preferentially lethal to cancer cells, most of which were not genomically altered. Chemotherapies and targeted agents with strong tumor-specific activities corroborated the siRNA profiling results and included drugs that targeted the mitotic spindle, the proteasome, and G<sub>2</sub>-M kinases <i>WEE1</i> and <i>CHK1</i> We also show the feasibility of <i>ex vivo</i> drug profiling for patients enrolled in a clinical trial.<b>Conclusions:</b> High-throughput phenotyping with siRNA and drug libraries using patient-derived tumor cells prioritizes mutated driver genes and identifies novel drug targets not revealed by genomic profiling. Functional profiling is a promising adjunct to DNA sequencing for precision oncology. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(12); 2828-43. \u00a92018 AACR</i>.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Erlotinib or gefitinib for the treatment of relapsed platinum pretreated non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer: a systematic review.. Abstract: Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, resistance to platinum agents invariably develops. Targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have great potential here as they exert their anti-tumour effect via alternative mechanisms to platinum-based drugs and as such may remain unaffected by emergent resistance to platinum. A systematic review was conducted to investigate whether two EGFR-TKIs, erlotinib and gefitinib, have efficacy in the platinum-resistance setting. Preclinical studies of platinum-resistant cancer cell lines, which had been subsequently treated with EGFR-TKIs, were sought to establish proof-of-concept. Clinical trials reporting administration of EGFR-TKIs to ovarian cancer and NSCLC patients relapsed after therapy with platinum drugs were investigated to determine sensitivity of these cohorts to EGFR-TKI treatment. The role of EGFR mutation, copy number and protein expression on response to EGFR-TKIs after failure of platinum chemotherapy were also investigated. Preclinical models of platinum-resistant cancer were found which display a spectrum of cross-resistance profiles to EGFR-TKIs. Sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs is dependent on the activation of the EGFR pathway or EGFR interacting proteins such as HER-2. EGFR-TKIs show favourable response rates in platinum-pretreated NSCLC, 11.14% and 15.25% for 150mg/day erlotinib and 250mg/day gefitinib, respectively. These response rates significantly improve in patients of Asian descent (28.3% and 29.17%, respectively) and patients with EGFR activation mutations (41.6% and 63.89%, respectively) or increased copy number (33.3% and 45.45%, respectively). Gefitinib significantly outperformed erlotinib and should therefore be the EGFR-TKI of choice in platinum-pretreated relapsed NSCLC. In contrast, response rates are very poor to both erlotinib and gefitinib in platinum pretreated ovarian cancer, 0-5.9% and they should not be used in this cohort of patients. Preclinical models demonstrate that, while cross resistance can occur between platinums and EGFR-TKIs, there is not a generalised cross-resistance phenotype. Erlotinib and gefitinib are suitable for the treatment of platinum-pretreated NSCLC, particularly in patients with EGFR mutations or increases in copy number. Unfortunately, the high rates of EGFR protein overexpression in ovarian cancer are not translating to a clinically useful therapeutic target for EGFR-TKIs; EGFR mutations are rare in ovarian cancer. Newer TKIs may improve response rates in these cohorts and future clinical trials need to collect tumour biopsies from all patients to ensure the success of personalised chemotherapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Managing Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Lung Cancer: Treatment and Novel Strategies.. Abstract: A proportion of patients with lung cancer experience long-term clinical benefit with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, most patients develop disease progression during treatment or after treatment discontinuation. Definitions of immune resistance are heterogeneous according to different clinical and biologic features. Primary resistance and acquired resistance, related to tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic mechanisms, are identified according to previous response patterns and timing of occurrence. The clinical resistance patterns determine differential clinical approaches. To date, several combination therapies are under development to delay or prevent the occurrence of resistance to ICIs, including the blockade of immune coinhibitory signals, the activation of those with costimulatory functions, the modulation of the tumor microenvironment, and the targeting T-cell priming. Tailoring the specific treatments with distinctive biologic resistance mechanisms would be ideal to improve the design and results of clinical trial. In this review, we reviewed the available evidence on immune resistance mechanisms, clinical definitions, and management of resistance to ICIs in lung cancer. We also reviewed data on novel strategies under investigation in this setting. Journal: Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Year: 2022.

Abstract: Precision oncology enables molecularly guided cancer therapy through multi-omics profiling, AI-driven classification, and biomarker-targeted interventions. Disulfidptosis has emerged as a promising therapeutic target, yet no ovarian cancer classification system currently incorporates this mechanism. The sequencing data of the samples in this study were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. We analyzed 76 genes associated with disulfidptosis and performed consensus clustering based on their expression profiles to stratify the samples into two molecular subtypes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing ovarian cancer tissues with normal samples. LASSO regression and random forest algorithms were then applied to screen marker genes that significantly influenced the clustering outcome. Ultimately, Ten disulfidptosis-related genes were ultimately selected to construct the predictive model. Single-cell sequencing was employed to characterize the tumor-specific expression patterns of key biomarkers. Digital spatial pathology analysis precisely mapped therapeutic target regions within tumor architectures. Immunohistochemical validation ultimately yielded clinically translatable biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Analysis of 76 disulfidptosis-related genes in ovarian cancer (OV) identified two molecular subtypes with distinct genomic profiles, tumor microenvironment characteristics, m6A regulator expression patterns, and clinical outcomes. Subgroup 1 showed copy number gains and immunosuppression, while Subgroup 2 exhibited higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and immune activation. Subgroup 2 exhibited significantly higher immune infiltration, along with upregulated immune checkpoints. A 10-gene signature and CNN+GRU classifier robustly stratified patients. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics confirmed epithelial-specific overexpression of key genes. This study identified a 10-gene signature related to disulfidptosis that is associated with distinct tumor microenvironment features, molecular heterogeneity, m6A modification patterns, and immune infiltration characteristics in ovarian cancer. Through multi-omics analyses-including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics-along with protein-level validation, our findings provide insights into the molecular landscape of ovarian cancer and suggest potential targets for future investigation into subtype-specific treatment strategies.

Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer has been of great interest to oncologists because these cancers do not benefit from hormonal therapies or treatments targeted against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 receptors. The only systemic therapy currently available is chemotherapy, and prognosis remains poor. We would like to describe recent pathological and genetic advancements and their possible implications on the development of new treatment strategies. Increasing pathological and molecular knowledge has led to a better understanding of breast cancer in general. Triple-negative breast cancer, however, remains a heterogeneous subgroup with difficult-to-define subtypes. New targeted therapies are currently being developed and researched. The recent advances in pathological and molecular knowledge have changed the landscape of breast cancer, with triple-negative breast cancer emerging as a pathological and clinical heterogeneous group. The main challenge lies in the development of new tailored treatment strategies for the various subgroups, with receptor kinase inhibition as the most promising new evolution to date. Further trials are needed to validate these new treatment options. Journal: Current opinion in oncology. Year: 2008. Authors: Stockmans G, Deraedt K, Wildiers H, Moerman P, Paridaens R.

Abstract: Identification of genes and molecular pathways with congruent profiles in the proteomic and transcriptomic datasets may result in the discovery of promising transcriptomic biomarkers that would be more relevant to phenotypic changes. In this study, we conducted comparative analysis of 943 paired RNA and proteomic profiles obtained for the same samples of seven human cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and NCI Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) [two major open human cancer proteomic and transcriptomic databases] that included 15,112 protein-coding genes and 1611 molecular pathways. Overall, our findings demonstrated statistically significant improvement of the congruence between RNA and proteomic profiles when performing analysis at the level of molecular pathways rather than at the level of individual gene products. Transition to the molecular pathway level of data analysis increased the correlation to 0.19-0.57 (Pearson) and 0.14-057 (Spearman), or 2-3-fold for some cancer types. Evaluating the gain of the correlation upon transition to the data analysis the pathway level can be used to refine the omics data by identifying outliers that can be excluded from the comparison of RNA and proteomic profiles. We suggest using sample- and gene-wise correlations for individual genes and molecular pathways as a measure of quality of RNA/protein paired molecular data. We also provide a database of human genes, molecular pathways, and samples related to the correlation between RNA and protein products to facilitate an exploration of new cancer transcriptomic biomarkers and molecular mechanisms at different levels of human gene expression.

Abstract: The rate of local recurrences, after breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, has dramatically changed in last decades, due to advances in surgical and radiation techniques and a more extensive use of adjuvant systemic treatments. However, the occurrence of local recurrences remains a major predictor for distant metastasis and is responsible for increased cancer-specific death. It has been estimated that 1 in 4 HR+ and HR-ipsilateral breast recurrences leads to widespread metastatic disease, with an annual mortality rate of 10% in the first 5 years. Nevertheless, very few studies have been conducted to evaluate the optimal care of purely HR+\u00a0local relapses of breast cancer, after surgical removal. In this review we have highlighted the available knowledge on prognostic assessment and systemic treatment for women experiencing local relapses of HR+\u00a0breast cancers, underlying unsolved questions and controversial clinical aspects.

Abstract: Activating mutations in cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (NT5C2) are considered to drive relapse formation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by conferring purine analog resistance. To examine the clinical effects of NT5C2 mutations in relapsed ALL, we analyzed NT5C2 in 455 relapsed B-cell precursor ALL patients treated within the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 relapse trial using sequencing and sensitive allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. We detected 110 NT5C2 mutations in 75 (16.5%) of 455 B-cell precursor ALL relapses. Two-thirds of relapses harbored subclonal mutations and only one-third harbored clonal mutations. Event-free survival after relapse was inferior in patients with relapses with clonal and subclonal NT5C2 mutations compared with those without (19% and 25% vs 53%, P < .001). However, subclonal, but not clonal, NT5C2 mutations were associated with reduced event-free survival in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.69; P = .001) and with an increased rate of nonresponse to relapse treatment (subclonal 32%, clonal 12%, wild type 9%, P < .001). Nevertheless, 27 (82%) of 33 subclonal NT5C2 mutations became undetectable at the time of nonresponse or second relapse, and in 10 (71%) of 14 patients subclonal NT5C2 mutations were undetectable already after relapse induction treatment. These results show that subclonal NT5C2 mutations define relapses associated with high risk of treatment failure in patients and at the same time emphasize that their role in outcome is complex and goes beyond mutant NT5C2 acting as a targetable driver during relapse progression. Sensitive, prospective identification of NT5C2 mutations is warranted to improve the understanding and treatment of this aggressive ALL relapse subtype. Journal: Blood. Year: 2020.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: A comparison of loco-regional relapse pattern in HPV positive vs negative oropharyngeal cancers following radiotherapy; relation to pretreatment FDG-PET and radiotherapy target volumes.. Abstract: Previous studies have shown that a large proportion of relapses in head-and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) following radiotherapy (RT) occur in the pretreatment FDG-PET avid volume (GTV-PET). The aim of the current work was to see if this was valid also in an oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) only population, and to compare the loco-regional relapse pattern between HPV positive and HPV negative patients. Among 633 OPSCC patients treated between 2009 and 2017, 46 patients with known HPV (p16) status and isolated loco-regional relapse were included. Oncologists contoured relapse volumes (RV) on relapse scans (PET/CT, CT or MR), which were thereafter deformed to match the anatomy of the planning CTs. The point of origin (center of volume) of the deformed RVs were determined and analyzed in relation to the RT target volumes (GTV-PET, GTV and CTVs). The relapse pattern was compared between HPV positive and HPV negative patients using Fischer's exact test. Sixty RVs were contoured in the 46 patients. 55% (95% CI 44-67%) of relapses originated in GTV-PET, while the other RT volumes harbored 12% (5-20%) (GTV), 18% (9-28%) (high risk CTV) and 5% (0-11%) (low risk CTV) of relapses. Six relapses were found outside the RT target volumes. No significant difference in relapse pattern between HPV positive and HPV negative patients was found (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.95). There were no signs of difference in loco-regional relapse pattern between HPV positive and HPV negative patients. In agreement with previous findings, GTV-PET was the most frequent RT target volume of relapse. Journal: Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden). Year: 2023.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Endometrial cancer prognosis correlates with the expression of L1CAM and miR34a biomarkers.. Abstract: Patients with endometrial cancer (EC) and presumably with good prognosis may develop a recurrence indicating that the classification of this tumor is still not definitive and that new markers are needed to identify a subgroup at risk of relapse. The cell adhesion molecule L1CAM is highly expressed in several human carcinomas and has recently been described as a new marker for endometrial and ovarian carcinomas. The aim of this study was to determine the relevance of L1CAM in recurrent EC. In this work we have analyzed, by immunohistochemical and RT-qPCR analysis, the expression of L1CAM in a cohort of 113 endometrial cancers at different stages, which 50% have relapsed. As a predictor of good outcome, the tumors were also analyzed for the expression of miR-34a, a post-transcriptional regulator of L1CAM. Among metastatic EC, the highest levels (60%) and the median level (24%) of L1CAM in tumors correlate with the progression, suggesting that the expression of this molecule is linked to the tumor component most involved in metastatic processes. We also found an inverse correlation between miR-34a and L1CAM protein expression, suggesting that miR-34a is a positive prognostic marker of EC. Our results demonstrate the expression of L1CAM and miR-34a in EC as prognostic factors that identify subgroup of patients at high risk of recurrence suggesting for them more aggressive schedules of treatment.

Abstract: Malignant cells exhibit metabolic changes, when compared to their normal counterparts, owing to both genetic and epigenetic alterations. Although such a metabolic rewiring has recently been indicated as yet another general hallmark of cancer, accumulating evidence suggests that the metabolic alterations of each neoplasm represent a molecular signature that intimately accompanies and allows for different facets of malignant transformation. During the past decade, targeting cancer metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy for the development of selective antineoplastic agents. Here, we discuss the intimate relationship between metabolism and malignancy, focusing on strategies through which this central aspect of tumour biology might be turned into cancer's Achilles heel.

Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the frequent subtype of lung cancer and the currently used treatment methods, diagnosis, and chemoresistance are relatively ineffective. Determining the pharmacological targets from active biomolecules of medicinal plants has become a frontiers era for biomedical research to develop novel therapies. In view of these scenarios, this pilot study, network pharmacology, cheminformatics, integrative omics, molecular docking and in vitro anti-cancer analysis were performed to unveil the multi-targeted treatment mechanisms of novel plant bioactives to treat lung cancer. Bioactive molecules from medicinal plants were compiled from PubChem. Network pharmacology approach revealed that 29 compounds efficiently target the 390 human and lung cancer associated genes. In addition, comparative analysis was performed and identified the 7 bioactive molecules significantly targeting 8 lung cancer genes. The integrative omics analysis discovered unique genes between the lung cancer and normal lung tissues. These genes were further validated through protein-protein interaction, gene ontology, gene functional and pathway enrichment, boxplot and overall survival analyses to understand the function of unique genes and their involvement in cancer signaling pathways. Survival heatmap analyses identified the significant prognostic genes. Docking results revealed that, lupeol and p-coumaric acid displayed high binding affinities with MIF, CCNB1, FABP4. Hence, we selected these two bioactives for in vitro analysis. Furthermore, these selected bioactives were showed concentration dependent cytotoxicity against the lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549). This holistic study has opened up novel avenues and unravels the cancer prognostic genes which could serve as druggable target and bioactives with anti-cancerous efficacy. Further functional validations are prerequisites to deciphering these bioactives as commercial drug candidates. Journal: European journal of pharmacology. Year: 2023.

Abstract: Resistance to chemotherapy and relapse are major hurdles for the effective treatment of cancer. Major reason for this is a small sub population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and its microenvironment. CSCs are critical driving force for several types of cancer, such as gastric, colon, breast and many more. Hence, for the complete eradication of cancer, it is necessary to develop therapeutic approaches that can specifically target CSCs. Chemical agents that target different proteins involved in CSC signaling pathways, either as single agent or simultaneously targeting two or more proteins have generated promising pre-clinical and clinical results. In the current review article, we have discussed various targets and cellular pathways that can be explored for the effective and complete eradication of CSCs. Some latest developments in the field of design, synthesis and screening of ligands to target cancer stem cells have been summarized in the current review article. Journal: Current drug targets.

Aside from small molecule inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases, monoclonal antibodies have also been found to provide valuable therapeutic approaches for modulating tumour pathophysiology. As our knowledge of cancer biology improves, the specificity of this new generation of drugs is generally delivering an improved therapeutic ratio compared to traditional cytotoxic agents. However, patient selection through the use of biomarkers is key in optimising efficacy and improving cost-effectiveness. The most recent wave of revolutionary new systemic therapy approaches to cancer has arrived in recent years in the form of immune checkpoint inhibitors, now clinically validated as modulators of immune-regulatory pathways. The future of oncology therapeutics includes a combination of cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Journal: Handbook of experimental pharmacology. Year: 2019.

Abstract: Cancer therapy has undergone a drastic revolution in the past few decades with the introduction of several novel therapies, like immunotherapy (active and passive), stem cell-based therapies, and nanocarrier-based therapies. These therapies have addressed the issues of conventional cancer therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy), like specificity and off-target effects. Further, the introduction of such treatments has improved survival and converted a terminal disease into a more manageable condition. However, many clinical, ethical, and regulatory issues are raised with such novel additions. Several effective therapies are under research but could not come to market or are delayed due to regulatory concerns for marketing approval. The scope of this review encompasses the examination of these regulatory issues and discuss their possible solutions. A practical and flexible regulatory approach, harmonized globally, could help the patients suffering from a terminal illness to lead a quality life.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Therapeutic targets for hepatocellular carcinoma identified using proteomics and Mendelian randomization.. Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) emerges as a formidable malignancy marked by elevated morbidity and mortality rates, coupled with a dismal prognosis. The revelation of gene-protein associations has presented an avenue for the exploration of novel therapeutic targets. Pooling plasma proteomic data (seven published GWAS) and HCC data (DeCODE cohort), we applied MR to identify potential drug targets, which were further validated in the FinnGen cohort and UK Biobank. Subsequent colocalization and summary-data-based Mendelian randomization analyses were performed for potential associations of this set of proteins. In addition, enrichment information pathways were investigated in depth by KEGG pathway analysis, single-cell sequencing, PPI and DGIdb, ChEMBL, and DrugBank database analyses, specific cell types enriched for expression were identified, interacting proteins were identified, and finally, druggability was assessed. In summary, the levels of 10 proteins are linked to HCC risk. Elevated levels of TFPI2 as well as decreased levels of ALDH1A1, KRT18, ADAMTS13, TIMD4, SCLY, HRSP12, TNFAIP6, FTCD, and DDC are associated with increased HCC risk. Notably, HRSP12 show the strongest evidence. These genes are primarily expressed in specific cell types within the HCC TME. Moreover, intricate protein-protein interactions, involving key players like ALDH1A1 and RIDA, ALDH1A1 and DDC, and ALDH1A1 and KRT18, contribute significantly to the amino acid metabolism and dopaminergic neurogenesis pathway. Proteins such as ALDH1A1, KRT18, TFPI2, and DDC are promising targets for HCC therapy and broader cancer drug development. Targeting these proteins offers substantial potential in advancing HCC treatment strategies. This research delineates 10 protein biomarkers linked to HCC risk and offers novel perspectives on its etiology, as well as promising avenues for the screening of HCC protein markers and therapeutic agents.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Novel Sphingolipid-Based Cancer Therapeutics in the Personalized Medicine Era.. Abstract: Sphingolipids are bioactive lipids that participate in a wide variety of biological mechanisms, including cell death and proliferation. The myriad of pro-death and pro-survival cellular pathways involving sphingolipids provide a plethora of opportunities for dysregulation in cancers. In recent years, modulation of these sphingolipid metabolic pathways has been in the forefront of drug discovery for cancer therapeutics. About two decades ago, researchers first showed that standard of care treatments, e.g., chemotherapeutics and radiation, modulate sphingolipid metabolism to increase endogenous ceramides, which kill cancer cells. Strikingly, resistance to these treatments has also been linked to altered sphingolipid metabolism, favoring lipid species that ultimately lead to cell survival. To this end, many inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism have been developed to further define not only our understanding of these pathways but also to potentially serve as therapeutic interventions. Therefore, understanding how to better use these new drugs that target sphingolipid metabolism, either alone or in combination with current cancer treatments, holds great potential for cancer control. While sphingolipids in cancer have been reviewed previously (Hannun & Obeid, 2018; Lee & Kolesnick, 2017; Morad & Cabot, 2013; Newton, Lima, Maceyka, & Spiegel, 2015; Ogretmen, 2018; Ryland, Fox, Liu, Loughran, & Kester, 2011) in this chapter, we present a comprehensive review on how standard of care therapeutics affects sphingolipid metabolism, the current landscape of sphingolipid inhibitors, and the clinical utility of sphingolipid-based cancer therapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway as a novel cancer drug target.. Abstract: Wnt proteins are a large family of secreted glycoproteins. Wnt proteins bind to the Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6 co-receptors, and through stabilizing the critical mediator beta-catenin, initiate a complex signaling cascade that plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Deregulation of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, mostly by inactivating mutations of the APC tumor suppressor, or oncogenic mutations of beta-catenin, has been implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis. Although oncogenic mutations of beta-catenin have only been discovered in a small fraction of non-colon cancers, elevated levels of beta-catenin protein, a hallmark of activated canonical Wnt pathway, have been observed in most common forms of human malignancies, indicating that activation of this pathway may play an important role in tumor development. Over the past 15 years, our understanding of this signaling pathway has significantly improved with the identification of key regulatory proteins and the important downstream targets of beta-catenin/Tcf transactivation complex. Given the fact that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is tightly regulated at multiple cellular levels, the pathway itself offers ample targeting nodal points for cancer drug development. In this review, we discuss some of the strategies that are being used or can be explored to target key components of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in rational cancer drug discovery.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Precision oncology: neither a silver bullet nor a dream.. Abstract: Precision oncology is not an illusion, nor is it the magic bullet that will eradicate all cancers. Precision oncology is simply another weapon in our growing armament against cancer. Rather than honing in on the failures of a relatively young field, one should advocate for integrating its successes into widespread clinical practice, especially for indications, such as: ABL, ALK, BRAF, BRCA1, BRCA2, EGFR, KIT, KRAS, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ROS1, BCR-ABL, FLT3 and ROS1, where aberrations have been shown to alter responses to US FDA approved drugs - that is, level 1 data. Moreover, to truly assess the promise of precision oncology, we must first begin by defining our expectations for this field. Importantly, we must recognize that the conception of precision oncology arose as an antithesis of the 'one-size fits all' cancer therapeutics approach. Consequently, tools used for evaluating these conventional, large-scale trials, are not directly transferable for assessing nonconventional, smaller-scale trials needed for evaluating precision oncology. Hence, a thorough vetting of precision oncology as another tool of the trade, must first begin by reassessing our expectations for this field, as well as current clinical trial designs and end point measurements. Importantly, we must recognize that most targeted therapy approaches are in their infancy, with only monotherapy approaches being assessed and combination therapies likely being necessary to fulfill the promise of precision oncology.

Abstract: Network-aided in silico approaches have been widely used for prediction of drug-target interactions and evaluation of drug safety to increase the clinical efficiency and productivity during drug discovery and development. Here we review the advances and new progress in this field and summarize the translational applications of several new network-aided in silico approaches we developed recently. In addition, we describe the detailed protocols for a network-aided drug repositioning infrastructure for identification of new targets for old drugs, failed drugs in clinical trials, and new chemical entities. These state-of-the-art network-aided in silico approaches have been used for the discovery and development of broad-acting and targeted clinical therapies for various complex diseases, in particular for oncology drug repositioning. In this chapter, the described network-aided in silico protocols are appropriate for target-centric drug repositioning to various complex diseases, but expertise is still necessary to perform the specific oncology projects based on the cancer targets of interest.

A literature search was performed for studies investigating therapies for relapsed testicular cancer. The prognosis of patients relapsing after first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy has improved with multimodality therapy, including conventional and high-dose chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. Prognostic factors are increasingly used to guide treatment intensity. High-dose chemotherapy has become an accepted treatment option, in particular in patients with poor risk factors at relapse. The outcome of patients with multiply relapsed or cisplatin-refractory disease remains particularly poor.

Abstract: Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. Despite aggressive therapy, the 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease remains poor, and beyond <i>PAX-FOXO1</i> fusion status, no genomic markers are available for risk stratification. We present an international consortium study designed to determine the incidence of driver mutations and their association with clinical outcome. Tumor samples collected from patients enrolled on Children's Oncology Group trials (1998-2017) and UK patients enrolled on malignant mesenchymal tumor and RMS2005 (1995-2016) trials were subjected to custom-capture sequencing. Mutations, indels, gene deletions, and amplifications were identified, and survival analysis was performed. DNA from 641 patients was suitable for analyses. A median of one mutation was found per tumor. In <i>FOXO1</i> fusion-negative cases, mutation of any RAS pathway member was found in > 50% of cases, and 21% had no putative driver mutation identified. <i>BCOR</i> (15%), <i>NF1</i> (15%), and <i>TP53</i> (13%) mutations were found at a higher incidence than previously reported and <i>TP53</i> mutations were associated with worse outcomes in both fusion-negative and <i>FOXO1</i> fusion-positive cases. Interestingly, mutations in <i>RAS</i> isoforms predominated in infants < 1 year (64% of cases). Mutation of <i>MYOD1</i> was associated with histologic patterns beyond those previously described, older age, head and neck primary site, and a dismal survival. Finally, we provide a searchable companion database (ClinOmics), containing all genomic variants, and clinical annotation including survival data. This is the largest genomic characterization of clinically annotated rhabdomyosarcoma tumors to date and provides prognostic genetic features that refine risk stratification and will be incorporated into prospective trials.

Abstract: The remarkable outcomes achieved with neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors for patients diagnosed with MSI colorectal cancer hold the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape in this context. Specifically, the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in colon cancer and dostarlimab in rectal cancer has led to an unprecedented rate of complete pathological and clinical responses. Notably, these responses have been further substantiated by the absence of relapses, with a 0% relapse rate observed during the first year of follow-up. The significance of these achievements becomes even more apparent when compared to the relatively high relapse rates, ranging from 11% to 28%, observed in MSI colorectal cancer cases treated neoadjuvantly with chemo(radio)therapy. However, it is crucial to exercise caution when interpreting such exceptional responses in oncology, especially within a short follow-up period. The future implications of these findings will depend on how the data mature over time. In this manuscript, we attempt to explore the potential scenarios that may unfold in the near future.

Abstract: Acquired resistance to next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is often driven by secondary <i>ALK</i> mutations. Here, we investigated utility of plasma genotyping for identifying <i>ALK</i> resistance mutations at relapse on next-generation ALK TKIs. We analyzed 106 plasma specimens from 84 patients with advanced <i>ALK</i>-positive lung cancer treated with second- and third-generation ALK TKIs using a commercially available next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform (Guardant360). Tumor biopsies from TKI-resistant lesions underwent targeted NGS to identify <i>ALK</i> mutations. By genotyping plasma, we detected an <i>ALK</i> mutation in 46 (66%) of 70 patients relapsing on a second-generation ALK TKI. When post-alectinib plasma and tumor specimens were compared, there was no difference in frequency of <i>ALK</i> mutations (67% vs. 63%), but plasma specimens were more likely to harbor \u22652 <i>ALK</i> mutations (24% vs. 2%, <i>P</i> = 0.004). Among 29 patients relapsing on lorlatinib, plasma genotyping detected an <i>ALK</i> mutation in 22 (76%), including 14 (48%) with \u22652 <i>ALK</i> mutations. The most frequent combinations of <i>ALK</i> mutations were G1202R/L1196M and D1203N/1171N. Detection of \u22652 <i>ALK</i> mutations was significantly more common in patients relapsing on lorlatinib compared with second-generation ALK TKIs (48% vs. 23%, <i>P</i> = 0.017). Among 15 patients who received lorlatinib after a second-generation TKI, serial plasma analysis demonstrated that eight (53%) acquired \u22651 new <i>ALK</i> mutations on lorlatinib. <i>ALK</i> resistance mutations increase with each successive generation of ALK TKI and may be underestimated by tumor genotyping. Sequential treatment with increasingly potent ALK TKIs may promote acquisition of <i>ALK</i> resistance mutations leading to treatment-refractory compound <i>ALK</i> mutations.

Abstract: Preclinical Research Cancer is one of the world's deadliest diseases, with very low survival rates and increased occurrence in the future. Successfully developed target-based therapies have significantly changed cancer treatment. However, primary and/or acquired resistance in the tumor is a major challenge in current therapies and novel combinational therapies are required. RNA interference-mediated gene inactivation, alone or in combination with other current therapies, provides novel promising therapeutics that can improve cure rate and overcome resistance mechanisms to conventional therapeutics. Hepatocyte Growth Factor/c-Met signaling is one of the most frequently dysregulated pathways in human cancers and abnormal c-Met activation is correlated with poor clinical outcomes and drug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In recent years, a growing number of studies have identified several inhibitors and microRNAs (miRNAs), specifically targeting c-Met in various cancers, including HCC. In this review, we discuss current knowledge regarding miRNAs, focusing on their involvement in cancer and their potential as research tools and therapeutics. Then, we focus on the potential use of c-Met targeting miRNAs for suppressing aberrant c-Met signaling in HCC treatment. Journal: Drug development research. Year: 2015.

Abstract: Unlike for adenocarcinomas of the lung, no molecular targeted therapies have yet been developed for squamous cell lung cancers, because targetable oncogenic aberrations are scarce in this tumor type. Recent discoveries have established that the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in cancer development by supporting tumor angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation via different mechanisms. Through comprehensive genomic studies, aberrations in the FGF pathway have been identified in various tumor types, including squamous cell lung cancer, making FGF receptor (FGFR) a potentially druggable target in this malignancy. Several multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors include FGFR in their target spectrum and a number of these compounds have been approved for clinical use in different cancers.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Clinical, Prognostic and Therapeutic Significance of Heat Shock Proteins in Cancer.. Abstract: Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) constitute a group of proteins that play a crucial role in the process of protein folding. HSPs are also known to modulate a number of key apoptotic factors. High expression of these proteins is reported in an array of cancers, such as breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, ovarian, gastric, oral and esophageal cancer. Ample amount of investigations were carried out on a variety of cancers suggesting HSPs as a promising hallmark in cancers. Their expression profile in several tumors elucidates that they help in proliferation, invasion, metastasis and death of cancerous cells. Detection of the levels of heat shock proteins and their specific antibodies in the sera of diseased individuals can play an important role in cancer diagnosis. This review will present and summarize latest research being carried out on heat shock proteins. It will also highlight the clinical and prognostic features of HSP27, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90 and HSP110, and will discuss future implications of HSPs in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Furthermore, the role of heat shock proteins as a therapeutic target in cancer will be discussed. In addition, the review article will report various studies, where HSPs have been targeted for their therapeutic potential. In summary, multiple experimental investigations have been successful in suggesting the role of heat shock protein as a clinical biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer. HSPs are associated with a number of cancer hallmarks such as cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Inhibition of HSPs has resulted in successful therapeutic outcome in cancer. It has served as a novel anti-cancer therapy for the treatment of several cancer forms. However, more experimental studies are required to elucidate the reliability and efficacy of heat shock proteins in combination with other conventional markers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Novel and effective interventions through HSP inhibition are expected to decrease the burden of cancer in the near future. Journal: Current drug targets. Year: 2018. Authors: Saini J, Sharma PK.

Abstract: BRG1 is one of two catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex. In cancer, it has been hypothesized that BRG1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Further study has shown that, under certain circumstances, BRG1 acts as an oncogene. Targeted knockout of BRG1 has proven successful in most cancers in suppressing tumor growth and proliferation. Furthermore, BRG1 effects cancer proliferation in oncogenic <i>KRAS</i> mutated cancers, with varying directionality. Thus, dissecting BRG1's interaction with various cellular pathways can highlight possible intermediates that can facilitate the design of different treatment methods, including BRG1 inhibition. Autophagy and apoptosis are two important cellular responses to stress. BRG1 plays a direct role in autophagy and apoptosis and likely promotes autophagy and suppresses apoptosis, supporting unfettered cancer growth. PRMT5 inhibits transcription by interacting with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, such as SWI/SNF. When PRMT5 associates with the SWI/SNF complex, including BRG1, it represses tumor suppressor genes. The Ras/Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway in cancers is a signal transduction pathway involved in the transcription of genes related to cancer survival. BRG1 has been shown to effect KRAS-driven cancer growth. BRG1 associates with several proteins within the signal transduction pathway. In this review, we analyze BRG1 as a promising target for cancer inhibition and possible synergy with other cancer treatments. Journal: International journal of molecular sciences. Year: 2023.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: ARID1A gene mutation in ovarian and endometrial cancers (Review).. Abstract: The AT-rich interacting domain\u2011containing protein 1A gene (ARID1A) encodes ARID1A, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Mutation of ARID1A induces changes in expression of multiple genes (CDKN1A, SMAD3, MLH1 and PIK3IP1) via chromatin remodeling dysfunction, contributes to carcinogenesis, and has been shown to cause transformation of cells in association with the PI3K/AKT pathway. Information on ARID1A has emerged from comprehensive genome\u2011wide analyses with next\u2011generation sequencers. ARID1A mutations have been found in various types of cancer and occur at high frequency in endometriosis\u2011associated ovarian cancer, including clear cell adenocarcinoma and endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and also occur at endometrial cancer especially in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. It has also been suggested that ARID1A mutation occurs at the early stage of canceration from endometriosis to endometriosis\u2011associated carcinoma in ovarian cancer and also from atypical endometrial hyperplasia to endometrioid adenocarcinoma in endometrial cancer. Therefore, development of a screening method that can detect mutations of ARID1A and activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway might enable early diagnosis of endometriosis\u2011associated ovarian cancers and endometrial cancers. Important results may also emerge from a current clinical trial examining a multidrug regimen of temsirolimus, a small molecule inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT pathway, for treatment of advanced ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma with ARID1A mutation and PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Also administration of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, can inhibit cancer proliferation with PIK3CA mutation and resistance to mTOR inhibitors and GSK126, a molecular\u2011targeted drug can inhibit proliferation of ARID1A\u2011mutated ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma cells by targeting and inhibiting EZH2. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of chromatin remodeling dysregulation initiated by ARID1A mutation, to develop methods for early diagnosis, to investigate new cancer therapy targeting ARID1A, and to examine the involvement of ARID1A mutations in development, survival and progression of cancer cells.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Subcellular Compartmentalization of Survivin is Associated with Biological Aggressiveness and Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.. Abstract: The role of subcellular survivin compartmentalization in the biology and prognosis of prostate cancer is unclear. We therefore investigated subcellular localization of survivin in more than 3000 prostate cancer patients by quantitative immunohistochemistry and performed transcriptomics of 250 prostate cancer patients and healthy donors using publicly available datasets. Survivin (BIRC5) gene expression was increased in primary prostate cancers and metastases, but did not differ in recurrent vs non-recurrent prostate cancers. Survivin immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was limited exclusively to the nucleus in 900 prostate cancers (40.0%), and accompanied by various levels of cytoplasmic positivity in 1338 tumors (59.4%). 0.5% of prostate cancers did not express survivin. Nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin staining intensities were strongly associated with each other, pT category, and higher Gleason scores. Cytoplasmic but not nuclear survivin staining correlated with high tumor cell proliferation in prostate cancers. Strong cytoplasmic survivin staining, but not nuclear staining predicted an unfavorable outcome in univariate analyses. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that survivin is not an independent prognostic marker. In conclusion, we provide evidence that survivin expression is increased in prostate cancers, especially in metastatic disease, resulting in higher aggressiveness and tumor progression. In addition, subcellular compartmentalization is an important aspect of survivin cancer biology, as only cytoplasmic, but not nuclear survivin accumulation is linked to biological aggressiveness and prognosis of prostate cancers.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to assess the biological significance of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), T315I mutation and treatment options in newly diagnosed and relapsed patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Our clinical-analytical and descriptive study enrolled 27 patients with different phases of CML, who were followed up and treated at the Institute of Oncology between 1995-2020. Venous blood samples were taken for LDH measurement, molecular screening and detection of T315I mutation of the ABL gene in order to investigate the biological significance of the increased LDH values and T315I mutation. CML patients underwent chemotherapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The patient age ranged from 20 to 67 years (mean 51.3\u00b12,14). The diagnosis of CML was established in the late chronic phase in 25 (92.6%) patients. The quantitative real-time PCR revealed p210 transcript of the BCR-ABL chimeric gene in all cases, with the range of 23.17-100% and median value of 74.73\u00b13.21%. LDH at diagnosis ranged between 169-1609.4 U/L and was increased in 14 (63.6%) patients, especially in those with leukocytosis over 100x109/l. The complete cytogenetic and complete or major molecular responses were recorded under treatment with different generations of TKIs in 16 (59.3%) cases, including 3 cases with T315I mutation. Relapses occurred in 10 (71.4%) patients with initially increased LDH values and in 5 of 6 patients with T315I mutation. One (3.7%) patient with T315I mutation evolved into the acute phase disease, and achieved the complete hematological response after treatment with ponatinib, a 3rd generation TKI. The survival of patients from the disease onset till the last monitoring visit ranged between 21 and 234.8 months (median 93.97\u00b14.52). The increased LDH values may indicate the activity at diagnosis and relapse of CML. In our study T315I mutation of the ABL gene and the increased values of LDH were associated with a higher rate of relapses and resistance to imatinib. Notwithstanding the treatment line and in relapses TKIs improve considerably the survival and ECOG-WHO score of CML patients.

Abstract: Despite great advances in treatment, 30-40% of patients with DLBCL undergo relapses. Patients with a relapse within 1\u00a0year or beyond have a distinct outcome. Few clinical characteristics and survival data in the Chinese population have been published. We aimed to define the incidence and clinical features of DLBCL patients with very early relapse after front-line immunochemotherapy who may benefit greatly from the emerging chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Data of 564 DLBCL patients were analyzed. Among the 413 patients achieving a first complete remission, 59 underwent relapses: 32 patients (54.2%) relapsed within 1\u00a0year, and 27 patients (46.8%) relapsed 1\u00a0year or more. Patients relapsing within 1\u00a0year, in comparison with the other group, showed an inferior risk profile at diagnosis: elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (P\u2009=\u20090.002), high Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score (P\u2009=\u20090.02), and high international prognosis index (P\u2009=\u20090.004). As expected, a worse overall survival was observed in the early relapse group. Multivariate analysis for OS showed that relapse within 1\u00a0year was an independent parameter for reduced overall survival (HR 0.241, P\u2009=\u20090.002).

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrative whole-genome and transcriptome analysis of HER2-amplified metastatic breast cancer.. Abstract: In breast cancer, the advent of anti-HER2 therapies has made HER2+ tumors a highly relevant subgroup. However, the exact characteristics which prohibit clinical response to anti-HER2 therapies and drive disease progression are not yet fully known. Integrative whole-genome and transcriptomic sequencing data from both primary and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer will enhance our understanding of underlying biological processes. Here, we used WGS and RNA sequencing data of 700 metastatic breast tumors, of which 68 being HER2+, to search for specific genomic features of HER2+ disease and therapy resistance. Furthermore, we integrated results with transcriptomic data to associate tumors exhibiting a HER2+-specific gene expression profile with ERBB2 mutation status, prior therapy and relevant gene expression signatures. Overall genomic profiles of primary and metastatic HER2+ breast cancers were similar, and no specific acquired genomics traits connected to prior anti-HER2 treatment were observed. However, specific genomic features were predictive of progression-free survival on post-biopsy anti-HER2 treatment. Furthermore, a HER2-driven expression profile grouped HER2-amplified tumors with ERBB2-mutated cases and cases without HER2 alterations. The latter were reported as ER positive in primary disease, but the metastatic biopsy showed low ESR1 expression and upregulation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting transformation to ER independence. In summary, although the quantity of variants increased throughout HER2-positive breast cancer progression, the genomic composition remained largely consistent, thus yielding no new major processes beside those already operational in primary disease. Our results suggest that integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses may be key in establishing therapeutic options. Journal: Breast cancer research : BCR. Year: 2023.

Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype of lung cancer, and the prognosis is poor due to distant metastasis. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome metastasis. A series of in vitro and in vivo phenotype experiments were performed to investigate the role of phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) in NSCLC. The RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, messenger RNA (mRNA) stability assay, and LC-MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. PDE1A has been shown to promote metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A-coexpressed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of the YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating the STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting RNAs and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET. Indeed, PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2, destabilized SOCS2, and activated the STAT3 pathway. Mechanistic data uncover a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 axis driving NSCLC metastasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for metastatic disease. Journal: eLife. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous malignancy that poses tremendous clinical challenge. Based on unsupervised classification of whole-genome gene expression profiles, four molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer were recently identified. However, single-driver molecular events specific to these subtypes have not been clearly elucidated. We aim to characterize the regulatory mechanisms underlying the poor prognosis mesenchymal subtype of ovarian cancer using a systems biology approach, involving a variety of molecular modalities including gene and microRNA expression profiles. miR-508-3p emerged as the most powerful determinant that regulates a cascade of dysregulated genes in the mesenchymal subtype, including core genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Moreover, miR-508-3p down-regulation, due to promoter hypermethylation, was directly correlated with metastatic behaviors in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our multidimensional network analysis identified miR-508-3p as a master regulator that defines the mesenchymal subtype and provides a novel prognostic biomarker to improve management of this disease.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Engineering small-molecule and protein drugs for targeting bone tumors.. Abstract: Bone cancer is common and severe. Both primary (e.g., osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma) and secondary (e.g., metastatic) bone cancers lead to significant health problems and death. Currently, treatments such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and radiation therapy are used to treat bone cancer, but they often only shrink or slow tumor growth and do not eliminate cancer completely. The bone microenvironment contributes unique signals that influence cancer growth, immunogenicity, and metastasis. Traditional cancer therapies have limited effectiveness due to off-target effects and poor distribution on bones. As a result, therapies with improved specificity and efficacy for treating bone tumors are highly needed. One of the most promising strategies involves the targeted delivery of pharmaceutical agents to the site of bone cancer by introduction of bone-targeting moieties, such as bisphosphonates or oligopeptides. These moieties have high affinities to the bone hydroxyapatite matrix, a structure found exclusively in skeletal tissue, and can enhance the targeting ability and efficacy of anticancer drugs when combating bone tumors. This review focuses on the engineering of small molecules and proteins with bone-targeting moieties for the treatment of bone tumors.

Abstract: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment has achieved durable responses in TNBC patients, whereas a fraction of them showed non-sensitivity to the treatment and the mechanism is still unclear. Pre- and post-treatment plasma samples from triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients treated with immunotherapy were measured by tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry. Public proteome data of lung cancer and melanoma treated with immunotherapy were employed to validate the findings. Blood and tissue single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of TNBC patients treated with or without immunotherapy were analyzed to identify the derivations of plasma proteins. RNA-seq data from IMvigor210 and other cancer types were used to validate plasma proteins in predicting response to immunotherapy. A random forest model constructed by FAP, LRG1, LBP and COMP could well predict the response to immunotherapy. The activation of complement cascade was observed in responders, whereas FAP and COMP showed a higher abundance in non-responders and negative correlated with the activation of complements. scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq analysis suggested that FAP, COMP and complements were derived from fibroblasts of tumor tissues. We constructe an effective plasma proteomic model in predicting response to immunotherapy, and find that FAP<sup>+</sup> and COMP<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts are potential targets for reversing immunotherapy resistance.

Variation in tumor purity (proportion of cancer cells in a sample) can both confound integrative analysis and enable studies of tumor heterogeneity. Here we developed PUREE, which uses a weakly supervised learning approach to infer tumor purity from a tumor gene expression profile. PUREE was trained on gene expression data and genomic consensus purity estimates from 7864 solid tumor samples. PUREE predicted purity with high accuracy across distinct solid tumor types and generalized to tumor samples from unseen tumor types and cohorts. Gene features of PUREE were further validated using single-cell RNA-seq data from distinct tumor types. In a comprehensive benchmark, PUREE outperformed existing transcriptome-based purity estimation approaches. Overall, PUREE is a highly accurate and versatile method for estimating tumor purity and interrogating tumor heterogeneity from bulk tumor gene expression data, which can complement genomics-based approaches or be used in settings where genomic data is unavailable.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: An integrated epigenomic-transcriptomic landscape of lung cancer reveals novel methylation driver genes of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.. Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Aberrant DNA methylation occurs commonly during carcinogenesis and is of clinical value in human cancers. However, knowledge of the impact of DNA methylation changes on lung carcinogenesis and progression remains limited. <b>Methods:</b> Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were surveyed in 18 pairs of tumors and adjacent normal tissues from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS). An integrated epigenomic-transcriptomic landscape of lung cancer was depicted using the multi-omics data integration method. <b>Results:</b> We discovered a large number of hypermethylation events pre-marked by poised promoter in embryonic stem cells, being a hallmark of lung cancer. These hypermethylation events showed a high conservation across cancer types. Eight novel driver genes with aberrant methylation (e.g., PCDH17 and IRX1) were identified by integrated analysis of DNA methylome and transcriptome data. Methylation level of the eight genes measured by pyrosequencing can distinguish NSCLC patients from lung tissues with high sensitivity and specificity in an independent cohort. Their tumor-suppressive roles were further experimentally validated in lung cancer cells, which depend on promoter hypermethylation. Similarly, 13 methylation-driven ncRNAs (including 8 lncRNAs and 5 miRNAs) were identified, some of which were co-regulated with their host genes by the same promoter hypermethylation. Finally, by analyzing the transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, we uncovered sets of TFs driving the expression of epigenetically regulated genes and highlighted the epigenetic regulation of gene expression of TCF21 through DNA methylation of EGR1 binding motifs. <b>Conclusions:</b> We discovered several novel methylation driver genes of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance in lung cancer. Our findings revealed that DNA methylation in TF binding motifs regulates target gene expression by affecting the binding ability of TFs. Our study also provides a valuable epigenetic resource for identifying DNA methylation-based diagnostic biomarkers, developing cancer drugs for epigenetic therapy and studying cancer pathogenesis.

Abstract: International guidelines have set the frame and methods of patients' surveillance after early breast cancer (BC) treatment. Since 1998, delegation of low-risk BC patients follow-up to nonhospital practitioners has been developed within a care network in the Paris region. We used the Gynecomed care network digital database to describe the characteristics of oncological events which occurred in the cohort, and to assess the quality of BC follow-up in relapsing patients. Events were defined as any local, contralateral, or metastatic recurrence, as well as second cancer or death due to any cause. We developed a ranked evaluation method of our surveillance program. Among the 3019 patients followed in the network, 116 (4.3%) patients had 116 events. Median follow-up was 7.1\u00a0years (0-51). First events were local-regional relapses, contralateral BCs, metastatic events, second primaries in respectively 52, 26, 14, 24 cases. During the first 5\u00a0years, 68.4% of surveillance visits were performed on time, 13.5% were behind schedule and 18.1% were not performed, while 79.1% of mammographies were performed on time, 7.7% behind schedule, and 13.2% were not performed. On schedule examinations allowed diagnosis of 77% of the local-regional, ipsilateral relapses or contralateral BCs, including 38 (69%) discovered by mammographies and 17 (31%) by clinical examination. A nonhospital practitioner care network is able to comply with good surveillance practices and deliver high quality surveillance, in accordance with international guidelines. Delegation of low-risk BC surveillance to nonhospital practitioners is reliable. Journal: The breast journal. Year: 2017. Authors: Agopian A, Dubot C, Houzard S, Savignoni A, Fridmann S.

Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Gastric cancer (GC), a prevalent and life-threatening malignancy, poses significant challenges in diagnosis and prognosis due to its complex molecular pathogenesis. Identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets is crucial for advancing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. This study investigates the role of synaptotagmin-4 (SYT4), recently identified as an oncogene, in GC development. <b>Methods:</b> We integrated proteomic and clinical analyses to evaluate SYT4 expression levels and their correlations with clinical features. Bioinformatic and clinicopathological assessments further validated SYT4's clinical relevance. Through comprehensive <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments-including immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS), co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), GST pull-down assays, and TOP/FOP luciferase reporter assays-we delineated SYT4's biological functions and interaction mechanisms. Additionally, we investigated the therapeutic potential of borussertib, a specific SYT4 inhibitor, in suppressing GC tumorigenicity. <b>Results:</b> SYT4 expression was significantly upregulated in GC tissues and strongly correlated with poor prognosis. Functionally, SYT4 drove cell proliferation, promoted cell cycle progression, and suppressed apoptosis in both cellular and animal models. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SYT4 directly interacts with PSMC6 via its C2B domain (amino acids 288-423), and stabilizes PSMC6 protein, thereby activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Notably, borussertib, a targeted SYT4 inhibitor, markedly suppressed SYT4 activity, leading to attenuated GC progression. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings demonstrate that SYT4 is a critical driver of GC progression via activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Moreover, we uncovered a novel mechanism by which borussertib selectively inhibits SYT4's oncogenic activity, providing compelling evidence for its therapeutic potential in gastric cancer treatment.

Although a majority of patients with first relapsed Ph-positive ALL respond to subsequent salvage chemotherapy plus TKI combination, their outcomes remain poor. The main predictor of survival is the achievement of major molecular response anytime during the morphological response. More treatment strategies to improve survival are under investigation. Monoclonal antibodies and bispecific antibody constructs hold considerable promise in improving the outcomes of patients with relapsed ALL including Ph-positive ALL.

Abstract: Of 109 patients with histologically confirmed Burkitt's lymphoma who completed a course of chemotherapy, 86 (79%) achieved complete remission. Forty-five (52%) of patients with initial complete remission relapsed with tumour over an observation period ranging from 2 years to over 5 years. Relapse was more common in patients who initially presented with abdominal or central nervous system (CNS) involvement than in patients who presented with localized facial tumours (p less than 0.01). Anatomical distribution of tumour on relapse differed from that at presentation. Facial bones were much less frequently involved on relapse; on the other hand, the CNS, cranial nerves, orbits and skin were frequent sites of disease on relapse. CNS involvement occurred in 42% (19/45) of patients at the first relapse and in 73% (11/15) of patients with multiple relapses. Prognosis in these patients was poor. Two relapse types were clinically identifiable. Early relapse (remission duration less than 12 weeks) was associated with frequent involvement of the CNS, drug resistance and a generally unfavourable outcome. Patients with late relapse (remission duration greater than 12 weeks) responded much better to secondary treatment. Possible pathogenic mechanisms underlying these two relapse types are discussed.

Abstract: We evaluated the use of alternating cycles of cyclophosphamide/etoposide and carboplatin/etoposide in children entered on National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS)-5 who were diagnosed between August 1, 1995 and May 31, 2002 and who relapsed after chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin (VAD) and radiation therapy (DD-4A). One hundred three patients who relapsed or had progressive disease after initial VAD chemotherapy and radiation therapy were registered on stratum C of the NWTS-5 Relapse protocol. Twelve patients were not evaluable: five due to insufficient data, six due to major protocol violations, and one for refusal of therapy. Among the 91 remaining patients, 14 with stage V Wilms tumor (WT), 1 with contralateral relapse, and 16 who did not achieve a complete response (CR) to the initial three-drug chemotherapy were not included in this analysis. Relapse treatment included alternating courses of the drug pairs cyclophosphamide/etoposide and carboplatin/etoposide, surgery, and radiation therapy. The outcomes of 60 patients were analyzed. The lung was the only site of relapse for 33 patients; other sites of relapse included the operative bed, the abdomen, and liver. Four-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 42.3 and 48.0% respectively for all patients and were 48.9 and 52.8% for those who relapsed in the lungs only. Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent toxicity. These results demonstrate that approximately one-half of children with unilateral WT who relapse after initial treatment with VAD and radiation therapy can be successfully retreated.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling identifies feline fibrosarcoma as clinically amenable model for aggressive sarcoma subtypes.. Abstract: Fibrosarcomas (FSA) are malignant mesenchymal tumors characterized by low chemo- and radiosensitivity. Development of novel treatment strategies for human adult FSA is hindered by the low incidence and the absence of suitable clinical models. Interestingly, aggressive FSA occur more frequently in domestic cats, hence potentially representing a clinically amenable model to assess novel therapies such as targeted imaging or theranostics. However, a lack of molecular characterization of FSA and adjacent normal tissue (NT) in both species hinders identification of tumor-specific targets and undermines the translational potential of feline FSA. Combining laser-capture microdissection, RNAsequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we perform comprehensive profiling of 30 feline FSA and matched skeletal muscle, adipose and connective tissue. Clear inter-tissue differences allow identification of significantly upregulated and tumor-exclusive features that represent potential targets for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. While feline FSA are characterized by hyperactive EIF2, TP53 and MYC signaling, immune-related and neuronal pathways emerge as modulators of tumor aggressiveness and immunosuppression. A high degree of molecular similarity with canine and adult FSA allows identification of tumor targets that are conserved across species. Significant enrichment in DNA repair pathways in feline FSA correlate with aggressive clinical behavior in human soft-tissue sarcoma. Finally, we leverage the molecular profiles to identify vulnerabilities, including sensitivity to ATR and PARP inhibition as potential treatment for feline FSA. In conclusion, this detailed landscape provides a rich resource to identify target candidates and therapeutic vulnerabilities within and across species and supports feline FSA as relevant models for the human disease.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Using single-cell sequencing technology to detect circulating tumor cells in solid tumors.. Abstract: Circulating tumor cells are tumor cells with high vitality and high metastatic potential that invade and shed into the peripheral blood from primary solid tumors or metastatic foci. Due to the heterogeneity of tumors, it is difficult for high-throughput sequencing analysis of tumor tissues to find the genomic characteristics of low-abundance tumor stem cells. Single-cell sequencing of circulating tumor cells avoids interference from tumor heterogeneity by comparing the differences between single-cell genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenetic groups among circulating tumor cells, primary and metastatic tumors, and metastatic lymph nodes in patients' peripheral blood, providing a new perspective for understanding the biological process of tumors. This article describes the identification, biological characteristics, and single-cell genome-wide variation in circulating tumor cells and summarizes the application of single-cell sequencing technology to tumor typing, metastasis analysis, progression detection, and adjuvant therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Breakthroughs in synthetic controlling strategies for precision in CAR-T therapy.. Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) are synthetic receptors engineered to target a user-defined antigen. They comprise an extracellular single-chain variable fragment\u00a0for target recognition and intracellular signalling domains commonly derived from immune cells. CAR-T cells have proven to be successful in therapy of some cancers. CAR-T cells are activated upon antigen-priming and subsequent intracellular signalling. However, tonic signalling in CAR-T cells remains a challenge in developing CAR-T therapeutics of high efficacy as it causes early T-cell exhaustion, limiting therapeutic persistence. Moreover, a poor choice of target antigen leads to off-target cytotoxicity, often hampering the host's survival. In addition, conventional methods of delivering CAR gene circuits utilise viral vectors, such as lentiviruses and retroviruses, which insert the CAR gene circuits into transcriptionally active sites in the genome. This increases the risks of malignant transformation due to improper genome integration. Optimisation in CAR-T engineering, from the architecture of CAR gene circuits to the structure of CAR and the behaviour of CAR-T cells, is paramount to ensure high efficacy, persistence, and precision in CAR-T therapy. This review provides insights into engineering CAR-T cells for precision in cancer therapy by highlighting the key strategies recently developed to optimise the function and efficiency of CARs. The delivery method of CAR gene circuits, circuit and structural modification of CAR, T-cell phenotype manipulation and T-cell arming will be discussed to accentuate their interplay in regulating CAR-T therapy's safety, precision, and efficacy.

Abstract: Few studies have examined survival outcomes in relapsed childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in resource-limited countries. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic factors and survival outcomes of relapsed childhood AML in Thailand. The medical records of AML patients aged 0-15 years treated in a major tertiary center in Southern Thailand between December 1979 and December 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. The overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 316 AML patients were included and relapse occurred in 98 (31%) patients. Of these, 57 (58.2%) and 41 (41.8%) patients had early [\u22641 year from first complete remission (CR1)] and late (>1 year from CR1) relapses, respectively. Only 54 (55.1%) patients received chemotherapy after relapse. The 3-year OS of all relapsed patients was 3.5%. The 3-year OS of patients with early and late relapse were 0% and 8.5%, respectively (p=0.002). The 3-year OS of patients who received chemotherapy and those who did not were 6.5% and 0%, respectively (p <0.0001). The median survival time of patients who did not receive chemotherapy was 1.7 months. The 3-year OS of patients who achieved second complete remission (CR2) and those who did not were 12.6% and 0%, respectively (p <0.001). The relapsed AML rate was 31% and the survival outcome was poor with a 3-year OS of 3.5%. The adverse prognostic factors were early relapse, failure to achieve CR2 and those who did not receive chemotherapy after relapse. Journal: Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP.

Abstract: Five cases of relapsing acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) presenting as an ovarian tumor have been treated at this institution, representing the largest reported series. In a review of the literature we identified 18 additional cases of ovarian leukemic relapse. Together, these 23 patients form the basis for this report. Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom of ovarian leukemia. An abdominal mass is usually palpable, and at least four patients had hydronephrosis. Nine patients had documented bilateral ovarian involvement; however, bilateral disease was not a poor prognostic sign. Most ovarian relapses occurred more than 36 months after the original diagnosis of ALL, with these \"late'h relapsers responding more favorably to treatment than \"early\" relapsers. Definitive statements can not be made from a retrospective review of 23 case reports; however, salpingooophorectomy had no obvious advantage over simple biopsy, and there was no obvious advantage to the routine use of radiation therapy. Most failures in treating ovarian leukemia occurred within 2 years. Most failures were systemic rather than local, illustrating the need for aggressive multiagent systemic chemotherapy. Survival after ovarian leukemic relapse is possible, with eight of the 23 patients alive and in complete continuous remission following the ovarian relapse (median follow-up since relapse, 42 months; range, 2 to 135+ months). With the use of more intensive chemotherapy in recent protocols, the frequency of ovarian leukemic relapses appears to be decreasing. At this institution, no child with ALL diagnosed in the 1980s has subsequently developed an ovarian relapse. Journal: Journal of pediatric surgery. Year: 1991.

Abstract: Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, invasion, and metastasis and possess threat to humans worldwide. The scientific community is facing numerous challenges despite several efforts to cure cancer. Though a number of studies were done earlier, the molecular mechanism of cancer progression is not completely understood. Currently available treatments like surgery resection, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are not completely effective in curing all the cancers. Recent advances in the antisense technology provide a powerful tool to investigate various cancer pathways and target them. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) could be effective in downregulating the cancer-associated genes, but their in vivo delivery is the main obstacle. DNA enzymes (DNAzymes) have great potential in the treatment of cancer due to high selectivity and significant catalytic efficiency. In this review, we are focusing on antisense molecules such as siRNA and DNAzymes in cancer therapeutics development. This review also describes the challenges and approaches to overcome obstacles involved in using siRNA and DNAzymes in the treatment of cancers.

Abstract: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), a rare and highly aggressive form of breast cancer, accounts for 10% of breast cancer-related deaths. Previous omics studies of IBC have focused solely on one of genomics or transcriptomics and did not discover common differences that could distinguish IBC from non-IBC. Seventeen IBC patients and five non-IBC patients as well as additional thirty-three Asian breast cancer samples from TCGA-BRCA were included for the study. We performed whole-exon sequencing (WES) to investigate different somatic genomic alterations, copy number variants, and large structural variants between IBC and non-IBC. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to examine the differentially expressed genes, pathway enrichment, and gene fusions. WES and RNA-seq data were further investigated in combination to discover genes that were dysregulated in both genomics and transcriptomics. Copy number variation analysis identified 10 cytobands that showed higher frequency in IBC. Structural variation analysis showed more frequent deletions in IBC. Pathway enrichment and immune infiltration analysis indicated increased immune activation in IBC samples. Gene fusions including CTSC-RAB38 were found to be more common in IBC. We demonstrated more commonly dysregulated RAS pathway in IBC according to both WES and RNA-seq. Inhibitors targeting RAS signaling and its downstream pathways were predicted to possess promising effects in IBC treatment. We discovered differences unique in Asian women that could potentially explain IBC etiology and presented RAS signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in IBC treatment.

Groupe d'Oncologie-Pneumologie Clinique de l'Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Brussels and Li\u00e8ge, Belgium.. Abstract: The role of chemotherapy dose-intensification in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains unclear. This phase I-II study evaluates feasibility and outcome of combination chemotherapy at moderately elevated doses with concomitant thoracic radiotherapy in limited-disease SCLC. Moderately elevated doses of ifosfamide-epirubicin (cycles 1 and 3) and of carboplatin-etoposide (cycles 2 and 4) were given with G-CSF and peripheral blood stem-cell (PBSC) support. Thoracic radiotherapy (40 Gy) was given once daily during the first five days of each cycle. Overall toxicity was acceptable; most common side-effects were myelosuppression and asthenia. All 35 eligible patients responded (23 CR, 12 PR). Median time to progression was 15 months: median overall survival was 24.6 months. Only 6 of 25 relapsing patients (24%) presented with a locoregional recurrence while 12 of 25 (48%) relapsed in the central nervous system (CNS). This regimen is a feasible dose-intensification with an acceptable toxicity profile. Its efficacy was demonstrated by a 100% response rate, an excellent local tumor control rate and a median survival of 24.6 months. In the absence of PCI, CNS relapse is a major problem if adequate local control is achieved. Journal: Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology. Year: 1999.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Regulation of ERBB3/HER3 signaling in cancer.. Abstract: ERBB3/HER3 is emerging as a molecular target for various cancers. HER3 is overexpressed and activated in a number of cancer types under the conditions of acquired resistance to other HER family therapeutic interventions such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibody therapies. Regulation of the HER3 expression and signaling involves numerous HER3 interacting proteins. These proteins include PI3K, Shc, and E3 ubiquitin ligases NEDD4 and Nrdp1. Furthermore, recent identification of a number of HER3 oncogenic mutations in colon and gastric cancers elucidate the role of HER3 in cancer development. Despite the strong evidence regarding the role of HER3 in cancer, the current understanding of the regulation of HER3 expression and activation requires additional research. Moreover, the lack of biomarkers for HER3-driven cancer poses a big challenge for the clinical development of HER3 targeting antibodies. Therefore, a better understanding of HER3 regulation should improve the strategies to therapeutically target HER3 for cancer therapy. Journal: Oncotarget. Year: 2014.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Overcoming the challenges of primary resistance and relapse after CAR-T cell therapy.. Abstract: While CAR T-cell therapy has led to remarkable responses in relapsed B-cell hematologic malignancies, only 50% of patients ultimately have a complete, sustained response. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance and relapse after CAR T-cell therapy is crucial to future development and improving outcomes. We review reasons for both primary resistance and relapse after CAR T-cell therapies. Reasons for primary failure include CAR T-cell manufacturing problems, suboptimal fitness of autologous T-cells themselves, and intrinsic features of the underlying cancer and tumor microenvironment. Relapse after initial response to CAR T-cell therapy may be antigen-positive, due to CAR T-cell exhaustion or limited persistence, or antigen-negative, due to antigen-modulation on the target cells. Finally, we discuss ongoing efforts to overcome resistance to CAR T-cell therapy with enhanced CAR constructs, manufacturing methods, alternate cell types, combinatorial strategies, and optimization of both pre-infusion conditioning regimens and post-infusion consolidative strategies. There is a continued need for novel approaches to CAR T-cell therapy for both hematologic and solid malignancies to obtain sustained remissions. Opportunities for improvement include development of new targets, optimally combining existing CAR T-cell therapies, and defining the role for adjunctive immune modulators and stem cell transplant in enhancing long-term survival.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: CD44 as a drug delivery target in human cancers: where are we now?. Abstract: In the treatment of cancers, the dual goals of drug targeting are to deliver therapeutic agents more selectively to tumor tissue and to minimize exposure of normal tissues and organs to those agents, the latter causing toxicities that limit treatment and thereby attenuate clinical efficacy. CD44, a transmembrane proteoglycan, has been considered as a targetable candidate to generate a cancer-specific drug delivery axis. Although numerous preclinical studies showed promising results exploiting CD44 as such a target, results of two clinical trials, including a Phase III registration trial, have been very disappointing. Herein, we discuss the potential underlying causes that might have led to such failures, as well as the future of CD44-targeted cancer treatment. Journal: Expert opinion on therapeutic targets.

Abstract: A 58-year-old man was administered anti-programmed death ligand 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 antibodies for primary lung cancer with brain metastasis. Subsequent development of diarrhea was diagnosed as immune-related adverse event (irAE) colitis. Initially, his condition improved with prednisolone (1\u00a0mg/kg/day). Therefore, the dose was reduced to 5\u00a0mg, and his condition was maintained with 5-aminosalicylic acid. However, diarrhea recurred after re-administration of another immune checkpoint inhibitor. Prednisolone (0.5\u00a0mg/kg/day) was ineffective for the first relapse. After two doses of infliximab, irAE colitis improved. One year later, diarrhea recurred after steroid tapering. Treatment comprising prednisolone (1\u00a0mg/kg/day), two doses of infliximab, granulocyte-monocyte apheresis, and ustekinumab for the second relapse failed to improve his condition. Tacrolimus was initiated 3\u00a0months after the second flare occurred, resulting in rapid symptom resolution. Due to frequently relapsed irAE colitis, vedolizumab was administered as maintenance therapy, allowing steroids and tacrolimus to be discontinued and maintaining remission. Tacrolimus may be effective for relapsed refractory irAE colitis, particularly for cases that cannot be successfully treated with infliximab and other treatments. Vedolizumab can be used as maintenance therapy for frequently relapsing irAE colitis. Journal: Clinical journal of gastroenterology. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) emerge as a promising material in the realm of nanotechnology, boasting a unique combination of compatibility with living tissues, adaptable characteristics, and easily customizable surfaces, making them an attractive foundation for innovative cancer therapies. SiNPs permit the efficient loading of therapeutic agents, nucleic acids, and imaging agents, leveraging their structural design for enhanced payload capacity. The ability to precisely tune their dimensions, morphology, and surface properties allows controlled regulation of drug release timing and localization, thereby improving therapeutic precision and reducing unintended impacts on healthy tissues. Surface functionalization with ligands, antibodies, or peptides facilitates active targeting of cancer cells, boosting tumor-specific drug accumulation and reducing systemic toxicity. Beyond drug delivery, SiNPs excel in photothermal and photodynamic therapies. The light-responsive nature of these nanoparticles facilitates efficient photon-to-energy conversion, generating localized hyperthermia or cytotoxic reactive species for selective tumor ablation. Additionally, their dual role as contrast enhancers in imaging techniques like MRI and fluorescence enables real-time visualization of therapeutic response and tumor dynamics. Despite their promise, challenges like durable biological compatibility, immune system reactions, and scalable production need further development for clinical use. Ongoing studies prioritize optimizing nanostructure architecture, surface functionalization, and formulation methodologies to overcome existing challenges. In summary, SiNPs signify pioneering advancements in precision oncology, offering tailored therapeutic strategies. Their versatility enables multimodal therapies and image-guided treatments and minimizes adverse effects. Collaborative interdisciplinary efforts and continuous innovation are essential to unlocking their full capabilities, driving the development of next-generation precision oncology tailored to improve patient prognosis.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Protein lipidation in cancer: mechanisms, dysregulation and emerging drug targets.. Abstract: Protein lipidation describes a diverse class of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that is regulated by over 40 enzymes, targeting more than 1,000 substrates at over 3,000 sites. Lipidated proteins include more than 150 oncoproteins, including mediators of cancer initiation, progression and immunity, receptor kinases, transcription factors, G protein-coupled receptors and extracellular signalling proteins. Lipidation regulates the physical interactions of its protein substrates with cell membranes, regulating protein signalling and trafficking, and has a key role in metabolism and immunity. Targeting protein lipidation, therefore, offers a unique approach to modulate otherwise undruggable oncoproteins; however, the full spectrum of opportunities to target the dysregulation of these PTMs in cancer remains to be explored. This is attributable in part to the technological challenges of identifying the targets and the roles of protein lipidation. The early stage of drug discovery for many enzymes in the pathway contrasts with efforts for drugging similarly common PTMs such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which are routinely studied and targeted in relevant cancer contexts. Here, we review recent advances in identifying targetable protein lipidation pathways in cancer, the current state-of-the-art in drug discovery, and the status of ongoing clinical trials, which have the potential to deliver novel oncology therapeutics targeting protein lipidation.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Predictability of human differential gene expression.. Abstract: Differential expression (DE) is commonly used to explore molecular mechanisms of biological conditions. While many studies report significant results between their groups of interest, the degree to which results are specific to the question at hand is not generally assessed, potentially leading to inaccurate interpretation. This could be particularly problematic for metaanalysis where replicability across datasets is taken as strong evidence for the existence of a specific, biologically relevant signal, but which instead may arise from recurrence of generic processes. To address this, we developed an approach to predict DE based on an analysis of over 600 studies. A predictor based on empirical prior probability of DE performs very well at this task (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, \u223c0.8), indicating that a large fraction of DE hit lists are nonspecific. In contrast, predictors based on attributes such as gene function, mutation rates, or network features perform poorly. Genes associated with sex, the extracellular matrix, the immune system, and stress responses are prominent within the \"DE prior.\" In a series of control studies, we show that these patterns reflect shared biology rather than technical artifacts or ascertainment biases. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the DE prior to data interpretation in three use cases: (<i>i</i>) breast cancer subtyping, (<i>ii</i>) single-cell genomics of pancreatic islet cells, and (<i>iii</i>) metaanalysis of lung adenocarcinoma and renal transplant rejection transcriptomics. In all cases, we find hallmarks of generic DE, highlighting the need for nuanced interpretation of gene phenotypic associations.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The FDA Oncology Center of Excellence and precision medicine.. Abstract: In January 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formally established the Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) to streamline the development of cancer therapies by uniting experts from FDA product centers to conduct expedited review of drugs, biologics, and devices. In May 2017, the FDA approved a cancer treatment based on a biomarker, without regard to the tumor's site, by granting accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for patients with solid tumors that have the microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient biomarker. We describe here the OCE's role in this first site-agnostic approval and OCE programs for further advancement of oncology-related regulatory science and policy. In addition, the FDA's four expedited review programs that enable transformative therapies to reach patients with life-threatening malignancies earlier in the development process are key to the continued rapid development of safe and effective therapies for patients with few or no other treatment options. These changes at FDA are taking place in the context of recent progress in the understanding of the genetic and immunologic foundations of cancer, resulting in the development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. The traditional system of phased clinical trials has evolved as early trials of breakthrough therapies use expansion cohorts in a process known as seamless drug development. Increasingly, FDA approvals of targeted therapies are likely to have contemporaneous approvals of companion diagnostics to identify patients whose cancers harbor actionable abnormalities. Impact statement This publication describes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) first site-agnostic oncology drug approval, a landmark event in the history of cancer drug development. The role of the FDA's newly established Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) in this approval is described, as are several OCE programs to advance excellence in regulatory science in the era of precision medicine. Also provided is an overview of FDA's expedited drug review programs, which are important to the continued acceleration of therapeutics development for patients with life-threatening diseases and few or no other treatment options.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting Transcriptional Regulation with a CDK9 Inhibitor Suppresses Growth of Endocrine- and Palbociclib-Resistant ER+ Breast Cancers.. Abstract: The combination of endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, yet many patients relapse with therapy-resistant disease. Determining the mechanisms underlying endocrine therapy resistance is limited by the lack of ability to fully recapitulate inter- and intratumor heterogeneity in vitro and of availability of tumor samples from women with disease progression or relapse. In this study, multiple cell line models of resistant disease were used for both two-dimensional (2D)- and three-dimensional (3D)-based inhibitor screening. The screens confirmed the previously reported role of pro-proliferative pathways, such as PI3K-AKT-mTOR, in endocrine therapy resistance and additionally identified the transcription-associated cyclin-dependent kinase CDK9 as a common hit in ER+ cell lines and patient-derived organoids modeling endocrine therapy-resistant disease in both the palbociclib-sensitive and palbociclib-resistant settings. The CDK9 inhibitor, AZD4573, currently in clinical trials for hematologic malignancies, acted synergistically with palbociclib in these ER+in vitro 2D and 3D models. In addition, in two independent endocrine- and palbociclib-resistance patient-derived xenografts, treatment with AZD4573 in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant resulted in tumor regression. Tumor transcriptional profiling identified a set of transcriptional and cell-cycle regulators differentially downregulated only in combination-treated tumors. Together, these findings identify a clinically tractable combination strategy for overcoming resistance to endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer and provide insight into the potential mechanism of drug efficacy in targeting treatment-resistant disease. Targeting transcription-associated CDK9 synergizes with CDK4/6 inhibitor to drive tumor regression in multiple models of endocrine- and palbociclib-resistant ER+ breast cancer, which could address the challenge of overcoming resistance in patients.

Abstract: The identification of biomolecules associated with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has upmost importance for the elucidation of the disease mechanism and the development of effective diagnostic and treatment strategies. Despite particular findings in this regard, a holistic analysis encompassing molecular data from different biological levels has been lacking. In the present study, a meta-analysis of four transcriptome datasets was performed to identify gene expression signatures in PTC, and reporter molecules were determined by mapping gene expression data onto three major cellular networks, i.e., transcriptional regulatory, protein-protein interaction, and metabolic networks. We identified 282 common genes that were differentially expressed in all PTC datasets. In addition, six proteins (FYN, JUN, LYN, PML, SIN3A, and RARA), two Erb-B2 receptors (ERBB2 and ERBB4), two cyclin-dependent receptors (CDK1 and CDK2), and three histone deacetylase receptors (HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3) came into prominence as proteomic signatures in addition to several metabolites including lactaldehyde and proline at the metabolome level. Significant associations with calcium and MAPK signaling pathways and transcriptional and post-transcriptional activities of 12\u00a0TFs and 110 miRNAs were also observed at the regulatory level. Among them, six miRNAs (miR-30b-3p, miR-15b-5p, let-7a-5p, miR-130b-3p, miR-424-5p, and miR-193b-3p) were associated with PTC for the first time in the literature, and the expression levels of miR-30b-3p, miR-15b-5p, and let-7a-5p were found to be predictive of disease prognosis. Drug repositioning and molecular docking simulations revealed that 5 drugs (prochlorperazine, meclizine, rottlerin, cephaeline, and tretinoin) may be useful in the treatment of PTC. Consequently, we report here biomolecule candidates that may be considered as prognostic biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets for further experimental and clinical trials for PTC.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Navigating relapsed hepatoblastoma: Predictive factors and surgical treatment strategy.. Abstract: Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common primary hepatic malignancy in childhood. Relapse occurs in more than 50% of high-risk patients with a high mortality due to ineffective salvage therapies. The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors for relapsed HB and predictors of survival in a single tertiary referral center. A retrospective chart review showed 129 surgically treated HB patients from October 2004 to July 2020. Of the cohort, 22 patients presented with relapsed HB. Relapse was defined as re-appearance of malignancy after 4\u2009weeks of normalized AFP and disappearance of all tumors on imaging. Patients with relapsed HB had a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 45.4% compared to 93.1% in those without relapse (p\u2009=\u20090.001). When comparing PRETEXT IV, microvascular invasion, metastatic disease, and age on multivariate logistic regression, only PRETEXT IV was an independent risk factor for relapsed HB with an OR of 2.39 (95% CI: 1.16-4.96; p\u2009=\u20090.019). Mixed epithelial and mesenchymal HB (12/19, 63.2%) was the most common histology of primary tumors while pure epithelial HB (13/15, 86.6%) was the most common relapsed histology. Combination of surgical and medical therapy for relapsed disease was predictive of survival with an HR of 16.3 (95% CI: 1.783-149.091; p\u2009=\u20090.013) compared to only chemotherapy. This study demonstrates that PRETEXT IV staging is an independent predictor of relapsed disease. The most common relapsed histology was epithelial, suggesting a potential selection or resistance of this component. Surgical resection is a critical component of multimodal therapy for relapsed HB.

Abstract: Novel drugs and treatment modalities are urgently needed to further improve survival of children with cancer. In medical oncology, an increased understanding of the molecular basis of cancer is driving the development of new drugs that target relevant signaling pathways in cancer cells and tumor microenvironment. Small-molecule modulators of signal transduction and monoclonal antibodies against various cellular targets have been approved in adult cancers in recent years. These drugs are now starting to be considered for the use in children. Despite the biological differences between adult and pediatric cancers, common cellular pathways have emerged from experimental research. Thus, insights into clinical experience with molecular targeted drugs in adults may help to accelerate progress in pediatric oncology. Here, the authors review molecules and pathways for which drugs are approved for adult cancer treatment and provide links to existing and potential applications in pediatric oncology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting Notch Pathway in Cancer Diagnostics and Therapeutics: An Emerging Approach.. Abstract: The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway usually present in multicellular organisms, which plays a pivotal role in cell fate determination and proliferation. Due to this property, it is known to be highly oncogenic, especially in the dysregulated version of the Notch pathway, where apoptosis is inhibited and abnormal cell growth is supported. Notch receptors and ligand proteins play an essential role in cancers, such as myeloid leukemia, T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, and organ-specific, i.e., breast, colon, pancreas, and skin cancers. Any type of cancer generates due to genetic defects, including epigenetic alterations and mutations. The researchers can use these alterations to find a promising diagnostic as well as therapeutic tool for cancer. The successful inhibition of the Notch pathway with the help of specific biomarkers or suppression of gene expression represents a new remedy in cancer research. This article focuses on the various remedies hidden within the Notch pathway's mechanism, primarily based on different patents published in recent years for assisting cancer diagnosis and succeeding treatment.

Abstract: We present a systems strategy that facilitated the development of a molecular signature for glioblastoma (GBM), composed of 33 cell-surface transmembrane proteins. This molecular signature, GBMSig, was developed through the integration of cell-surface proteomics and transcriptomics from patient tumors in the REMBRANDT (n\u00a0= 228) and TCGA datasets (n\u00a0=\u00a0547) and can separate GBM patients from control individuals with a Matthew's correlation coefficient value of 0.87 in a lock-down test. Functionally, 17/33 GBMSig proteins are associated with transforming growth factor \u03b2 signaling pathways, including CD47, SLC16A1, HMOX1, and MRC2. Knockdown of these genes impaired GBM invasion, reflecting their role in\u00a0disease-perturbed changes in GBM. ELISA assays for a subset of GBMSig (CD44, VCAM1, HMOX1, and\u00a0BIGH3) on 84 plasma specimens from multiple clinical sites revealed a high degree of separation of GBM patients from healthy control individuals (area under the curve is 0.98 in receiver operating characteristic).

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Exon-Skipping-Based Subtyping of Colorectal Cancers.. Abstract: The identification of colorectal cancer (CRC) molecular subtypes has prognostic and potentially diagnostic value for patients, yet reliable subtyping remains unavailable in the clinic. The current consensus molecular subtype (CMS) classification in CRCs is based on complex RNA expression patterns quantified at the gene level. The clinical application of these methods, however, is challenging due to high uncertainty of single-sample classification and associated costs. Alternative splicing, which strongly contributes to transcriptome diversity, has rarely been used for tissue type classification. Here, we present an AS-based CRC subtyping framework sensitive to differential exon use that can be adapted for clinical application. Unsupervised clustering was used to measure the strength of association between different categories of alternative splicing and CMSs. To build a classifier, the ground truth for CMS labels was derived from expression data quantified at the gene level. Feature selection was achieved through bootstrapping and L1-penalized estimation. The resulting feature space was used to construct a subtype prediction framework applicable to single and multiple samples. The performance of the models was evaluated on unseen CRCs from 2 independent sources (Indivumed, n\u00a0= 129; The Cancer Genome Atlas, n\u00a0= 99). We developed a CRC subtype identifier based on 29 exon-skipping events that accurately classifies unseen tumors and enables more precise differentiation of subtypes characterized by distinct biological and prognostic features as compared to classifiers based on gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that a small number of exon-skipping events can reliably classify CRC subtypes using individual patient specimens in a manner suitable to clinical application.

Abstract: Brain cancer is a highly lethal disease, especially devastating toward both the elderly and children. This cancer has no therapeutics available to combat it, predominately due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) preventing treatments from maintaining therapeutic levels within the brain. Recently, nanoparticle technology has entered the forefront of cancer therapy due to its ability to deliver therapeutic effects while potentially passing physiological barriers. Key nanoparticles for brain cancer treatment include glutathione targeted PEGylated liposomes, gold nanoparticles, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and nanoparticle-albumin bound drugs, with these being discussed throughout this review. Recently, the survivin protein has gained attention as it is over-expressed in a majority of tumors. This review will briefly discuss the properties of survivin, while focusing on how both nanoparticles and survivin-targeting treatments hold potential as brain cancer therapies. This review may provide useful insight into new brain cancer treatment options, particularly survivin inhibition and nanomedicine. Journal: Nanomedicine (London, England). Year: 2018.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Receptor tyrosine kinases and cancer: oncogenic mechanisms and therapeutic approaches.. Abstract: Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane receptors of great clinical interest due to their role in disease, notably cancer. Since their discovery, several mechanisms of RTK dysregulation have been identified, resulting in multiple cancer types displaying 'oncogenic addiction' to RTKs. As a result, RTKs have represented a major class for targeted therapeutics over the past two decades, with numerous small molecule-based tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapeutics having been developed and clinically approved for several cancers. However, many of the current RTK inhibitor treatments eventually result in the rapid development of acquired resistance and subsequent tumor relapse. Recent technological advances and tools are being generated for the identification of novel RTK small molecule therapeutics. These newer technologies will be important for the identification of diverse types of RTK inhibitors, targeting both the receptors themselves as well as key cellular factors that play important roles in the RTK signaling cascade.

Abstract: DNA methylation and gene expression are two critical aspects of the epigenetic landscape that contribute significantly to cancer pathogenesis. Analysis of aberrant genome-wide methylation patterns can provide insights into how these affect the cancer transcriptome and possible clinical implications for cancer diagnosis and treatment. The role of tumor suppressors and oncogenes is well known in tumorigenesis. Epigenetic alterations can significantly impact the expression and function of these critical genes, contributing to the initiation and progression of cancer. This protocol chapter presents a unified workflow to explore the role of DNA methylation in gene expression regulation in breast cancer by identifying differentially expressed genes whose promoter or gene body regions are differentially methylated using various Bioconductor packages in R environment. Functional enrichment analysis of these genes can help in understanding the mechanisms leading to tumorigenesis due to epigenetic alterations. Journal: Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.).

Abstract: Sulfur mustard (SM), also known as mustard gas, is a chemical weapon which by now has been used in many wars. The most concerning SM toxic effect is probable carcinogenicity. In this study, the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of SM carcinogenicity, by focusing on treatment of SM-associated malignancies, particularly gene therapeutics, cancer vaccines, and epigenetic medications, have been criticized. The required data were collected through an organized search on valid scientific databases. For SM carcinogenicity due to acute or chronic exposure, the entire original and review articles were evaluated. In addition, studies on the therapeutic effects of available genetic and epigenetic medications were included. Currently, four gene therapeutics, two cancer vaccines with genetic bases, and seven epigenetic medications are available for cancer treatment. Genetic and epigenetic cancer treatments including Gendicine, Imlygic, Provenge, Cimavax-EGF, Azacitidine, Vorinostat, Romidepsin, and Belinostat will yield outstanding benefits for SM-exposed patients who suffer from cancer.

Abstract: To identify clinicopathologic factors predictive of early relapse (platinum-free interval (PFI) of \u22646 months) in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in first-line treatment, and to develop and internally validate risk prediction models for early relapse. All consecutive patients diagnosed with advanced stage EOC between 01-01-2008 and 31-12-2015 were identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy as initial EOC treatment were selected. Two prediction models, i.e. pretreatment and postoperative, were developed. Candidate predictors of early relapse were fitted into multivariable logistic regression models. Model performance was assessed on calibration and discrimination. Internal validation was performed through bootstrapping to correct for model optimism. A total of 4,557 advanced EOC patients were identified, including 1,302 early relapsers and 3,171 late or non-relapsers. Early relapsers were more likely to have FIGO stage IV, mucinous or clear cell type EOC, ascites, >1 cm residual disease, and to have undergone NACT-ICS. The final pretreatment model demonstrated subpar model performance (AUC = 0.64 [95 %-CI 0.62-0.66]). The final postoperative model based on age, FIGO stage, pretreatment CA-125 level, histologic subtype, presence of ascites, treatment approach, and residual disease after debulking, demonstrated adequate model performance (AUC = 0.72 [95 %-CI 0.71-0.74]). Bootstrap validation revealed minimal optimism of the final postoperative model. A (postoperative) discriminative model has been developed and presented online that predicts the risk of early relapse in advanced EOC patients. Although external validation is still required, this prediction model can support patient counselling in daily clinical practice. Journal: Cancer epidemiology. Year: 2021.

Abstract: Precision oncology informed by genomic information has evolved in leaps and bounds over the last decade. Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has moved to center-stage as the poster child of precision oncology, multiple targetable genomic alterations have been identified in various cancer types. RET alterations occur in roughly 2% of all human cancers. The role of RET as oncogenic driver was initially identified in 1985 after the discovery that transfection with human lymphoma DNA transforms NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Germline RET mutations are causative of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome, and RET fusions are found in 10-20% of papillary thyroid cases and are detected in most patients with advanced sporadic medullary thyroid cancer. RET fusions are oncogenic drivers in 2% of Non-small cell lung cancer. Rapid translation and regulatory approval of selective RET inhibitors, selpercatinib and pralsetinib, have opened up the field of RET precision oncology. This review provides an update on RET precision oncology from bench to bedside and back. We explore the impact of selective RET inhibitor in patients with advanced NSCLC, thyroid cancer, and other cancers in a tissue-agnostic fashion, resistance mechanisms, and future directions.

Abstract: Cancer remains a devastating disease as existing therapies are too often ineffective and toxicities remain unacceptably high. Immunotherapies for cancer offer the promise of the specificity and memory of the immune system against malignant cells to achieve durable cure with minimal toxicity. Beginning with the success of bone marrow transplantation for blood-borne cancers, and the more recent development of monoclonal antibody therapeutics for a variety of tumors, immunotherapies are already among the most successful class of treatments for cancer. Greater understanding of immunoregulatory mechanisms and improved techniques for immune cell manipulation and engineering have led to new immunomodulatory approaches and cell-based therapies for cancer that have generated great excitement within the biomedical community. As these technologies continue to improve, and as new approaches for harnessing the power and specificity of the immune system are developed, immunotherapies will play an increasingly important role in the treatment of cancer. Here, we review the history of immunotherapies for cancer and discuss existing and emerging immunotherapy technologies that hope to translate the promise of immunotherapy into clinical reality.

Abstract: Gemcitabine is used to treat a wide range of tumours, but its efficacy is limited by cancer cell resistance mechanisms. NUC-1031, a phosphoramidate modification of gemcitabine, is the first anti-cancer ProTide to enter the clinic and is designed to overcome these key resistance mechanisms. Sixty-eight patients with advanced solid tumours who had relapsed after treatment with standard therapy were recruited to a dose escalation study to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and assess the safety of NUC-1031. Pharmacokinetics and anti-tumour activity was also assessed. Sixty-eight patients received treatment, 50% of whom had prior exposure to gemcitabine. NUC-1031 was well tolerated with the most common Grade 3/4 adverse events of neutropaenia, lymphopaenia and fatigue occurring in 13 patients each (19%). In 49 response-evaluable patients, 5 (10%) achieved a partial response and 33 (67%) had stable disease, resulting in a 78% disease control rate. C<sub>max</sub> levels of the active intracellular metabolite, dFdCTP, were 217-times greater than those reported for equimolar doses of gemcitabine, with minimal toxic metabolite accumulation. The RP2D was determined as 825\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. NUC-1031 was well tolerated and demonstrated clinically significant anti-tumour activity, even in patients with prior gemcitabine exposure and in cancers not traditionally perceived as gemcitabine-responsive.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Cancer TARGETases: DSB repair as a pharmacological target.. Abstract: Cancer is a disease attributed to the accumulation of DNA damages due to incapacitation of DNA repair pathways resulting in genomic instability and a mutator phenotype. Among the DNA lesions, double stranded breaks (DSBs) are the most toxic forms of DNA damage which may arise as a result of extrinsic DNA damaging agents or intrinsic replication stress in fast proliferating cancer cells. Accurate repair of DSBs is therefore paramount to the cell survival, and several classes of proteins such as kinases, nucleases, helicases or core recombinational proteins have pre-defined jobs in precise execution of DSB repair pathways. On one hand, the proper functioning of these proteins ensures maintenance of genomic stability in normal cells, and on the other hand results in resistance to various drugs employed in cancer therapy and therefore presents a suitable opportunity for therapeutic targeting. Higher relapse and resistance in cancer patients due to non-specific, cytotoxic therapies is an alarming situation and it is becoming more evident to employ personalized treatment based on the genetic landscape of the cancer cells. For the success of personalized treatment, it is of immense importance to identify more suitable targetable proteins in DSB repair pathways and also to explore new synthetic lethal interactions with these pathways. Here we review the various alternative approaches to target the various protein classes termed as cancer TARGETases in DSB repair pathway to obtain more beneficial and selective therapy.

Abstract: Multiple classes of therapies targeting claudin-18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2) are under development for the treatment of advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma and other solid tumors. At the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, the final results of the phase 3 SPOTLIGHT trial were presented, demonstrating a significant survival benefit from the addition of the CLDN18.2-specific antibody zolbetuximab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas with \u2265\u200975% CLDN18.2 expression. Early-phase trial results presented at ASCO 2024 showed promising efficacy and safety of the afucosylated CLDN18.2-specific antibody FG-M108 in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of CLDN18.2-positive advanced gastroesophageal and pancreatic cancers. In addition, several early-phase trials presented at ASCO 2024 investigate other CLDN18.2-targeting approaches in CLDN18.2-positive refractory advanced solid tumors, including the CLDN18.2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates LM-302 and IBI343, the bispecific anti-CLDN18.2/CD3 antibody IBI38, and the chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy satricabtagene autoleucel. These novel approaches could potentially expand the benefit of CLDN18.2-targeting therapies to a broader range of tumor types and to tumors expressing lower levels of CLDN18.2.

Abstract: Microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, coexist in the human body, forming a symbiotic microbiota that plays a vital role in human health and disease. Intratumoral microbial components have been discovered in various tumor tissues and are closely linked to the occurrence, progression, and treatment results of cancer. The intratumoral microbiota can enhance antitumor immunity through mechanisms such as activating the stimulator of interferon genes signaling pathway, stimulating T and NK cells, promoting the formation of TLS, and facilitating antigen presentation. Conversely, the intratumoral microbiota might suppress antitumor immune responses by increasing reactive oxygen species levels, creating an anti-inflammatory environment, inducing T cell inactivation, and enhancing immune suppression, thereby promoting cancer progression. The impact of intratumoral microbiota on antitumor immunity varies based on microbial composition, interactions with cancer cells, and the cancer's current state. A deep understanding of the complex interactions between intratumoral microbiota and antitumor immunity holds the potential to bring new therapeutic strategies and targets to cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Despite high response rates to initial therapy, most patients with ovarian cancer will ultimately recur and go on to develop resistance to standard treatments. Novel therapies have been developed to overcome drug resistance and alter the tumor immune microenvironment by targeting oncogenic pathways, activating the innate immune response, and enhancing drug delivery. In this review, we discuss the current and future roles of chemotherapy, targeted agents such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, bevacizumab, and mirvetuximab in the treatment of ovarian cancer. We explore the emerging role of therapeutic targets, including DNA repair pathway inhibitors and novel antibody-drug conjugates. Furthermore, we delve into the role of immunotherapeutic agents such as interleukins as well as immune-promoting agents such as oncolytic viruses and cancer vaccines. Innovative combination therapies using these agents have led to a rapidly evolving treatment landscape and promising results for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) shows profound inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity, but differences across ancestries remain understudied. We assemble the largest cohort of GBMs from East Asian patients (EAS-GBM) and perform genomic and transcriptomic analyses. Transcriptomic clustering reveals distinct EAS-GBM molecular subtypes-proliferative (PL), neurosynaptic (NS), metabolic (MB), and immunomodulatory (IM)-based on activated biological pathways. We also identify protein markers enabling subtype classification in pathology. Comparative analysis with the predominantly European-ancestry The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM dataset (EUR-GBM) reveals similar main drivers, though EAS-GBMs lack the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-defined classical EUR-GBM subtype. EAS PL-GBMs display CCNE1/CCND2 overexpression, with myelocytomatosis viral oncogene (MYC) signaling activation. The IM-GBM cluster exhibits an immunotherapy-responsive expression profile, corroborated by improved overall survival under immune checkpoint blockade in an external dataset. Together, our data reveal distinctive genomic features of EAS-GBMs that may inform patient stratification for targeted therapy and drug development tailored to the EAS population.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-protein-coding small RNA molecules that negatively regulate target messenger RNA through degradation or suppression of protein translation. MiRNAs play important roles in the control of many biologic processes, such as development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Increasing evidence shows that aberrant miRNA expression profiles and unique miRNA signaling pathways are present in a variety of cancers. MiRNAs function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors during tumor development and progression. Experimental evidence demonstrates that correction of specific miRNA alterations using miRNA mimics or antagomirs can normalize the gene regulatory network and signaling pathways, and reverse the phenotype in cancerous cells. MiRNA-based gene therapy provides an attractive anti-tumor approach for integrated cancer therapy. In this review, we focus on miRNA-based treatment for cancers, summarize the delivery systems used in experimental and preclinical research, such as liposomes, viral vectors, and nanoparticles, and consider the safety and toxicity of miRNA therapy.

The single biggest challenge in management of this disease is late relapse, and we review new methods for identifying which patients are at risk of late relapse and potential therapeutic approaches in clinical trials. CDK4/6 inhibitors have become a standard treatment option for high-risk patients in both the adjuvant setting and the first-line metastatic setting, and we review data on optimal treatment after progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors. Targeting the estrogen receptor remains the single most effective way of targeting the cancer, and we review the developments in new oral selective ER degraders that are becoming a standard of care in cancers with ESR1 mutations and potential future directions.

Abstract: Lapatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), also inhibits breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) involved in resistance to topotecan. The aim of this multicenter study was to assess the efficacy of the combination topotecan-lapatinib in epithelial ovarian cancer relapsing after a first line of chemotherapy. Patients having relapsed within 6 months (n = 20) or between 6 and 12 months (n = 19) received weekly topotecan (3.2 mg/m given intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15) and daily oral lapatinib (1250 mg). Translational studies were performed on tumor and serum. An objective (partial) response was observed for 5 patients (14%), all with late relapse. The rates of overall benefits, including responses and stabilizations, were 37% and 62% in patients having relapsed within or after 6 months, respectively. Corresponding median time to progression were 58 and 94 days. The most frequent toxicity was hematological, including grade 4 neutropenia (18%) and thrombocytopenia (3%). None of the tumors overexpressed HER2 or EGFR, and no mutation was found. Two Kras mutations were identified. Positive expressions of BCRP and cyclin A (median, 70% and 40%) were not correlated to the response to treatment. This study failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit of lapatinib-topotecan compared to previously described activity with topotecan alone in a context of low levels of EGFR and HER2 expressions, and no biomarkers could be identified. The absence of correlation between BCRP expression and clinical outcomes suggests that other mechanisms of resistance to topotecan could predominate.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the US and is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the next decade. Despite 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel significantly improving outcomes for metastatic cancer, refractory disease still poses significant challenges. Difficulties with early detection and the inherent chemo- and radio-resistant nature of this malignancy led to attempts to define the sequential biology of pancreatic cancer in order to improve survival outcomes. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is characterized by several germline or acquired genetic mutations, the most common being KRAS (90%), CDK2NA (90%), TP53 (75%-90%), DPC4/SMAD4 (50%). In addition, the tumor microenvironment, chemoresistant cancer stem cells, and the desmoplastic stroma have been the target of some promising clinical investigations. Among the core pathways reproducibly shown to lead the development and progression of this disease, DNA repair, apoptosis, G1/S cell cycle transition, KRAS, Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, TGF-beta, and other cell invasion pathways, have been the target of \"precision therapeutics\". No single molecularly targeted therapeutic though has been uniformly successful, probably due to the tumor heterogeneity, but biomarker research is evolving and it hopes to select more patients likely to benefit. Recent reports note activity with immunotherapies such as CD40 agonists, CCR2 inhibitors, cancer vaccines, and novel combinations against the immunosuppressive tumor milieu are ongoing. While many obstacles still exist, clearly we are making progress in deciphering the heterogeneity within pancreatic cancers. Integrating conventional and immunological targeting will be the key to effective treatment of this deadly disease. Journal: Drug design, development and therapy. Year: 2015.

AhR also plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Its role in cancer is complex, encompassing both pro- and anti-tumorigenic activities. Its level of expression and activity are specific to each tumor and patient, increasing the difficulty of understanding the activating or inhibiting roles of AhR ligands. We explored the role of AhR in tumor cell lines and patients using genomic data sets and discuss the extent to which AhR can be considered as a therapeutic target.

Abstract: The journey of cancer development is a multifaceted and staged process. The array of treatments available for cancer varies significantly, dictated by the disease's type and stage. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), prevalent across various cancer types and stages, play a pivotal role in tumor genesis, progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. The strategy of concurrently targeting cancer cells and CAFs holds great promise in cancer therapy. In this review, we focus intently on CAFs, delving into their critical role in cancer's progression. We begin by exploring the origins, classification, and surface markers of CAFs. Following this, we emphasize the key cytokines and signaling pathways involved in the interplay between cancer cells and CAFs and their influence on the tumor immune microenvironment. Additionally, we examine current therapeutic approaches targeting CAFs. This article underscores the multifarious roles of CAFs within the tumor microenvironment and their potential applications in cancer treatment, highlighting their importance as key targets in overcoming drug resistance and enhancing the efficacy of tumor therapies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Down-regulated miR-331-5p and miR-27a are associated with chemotherapy resistance and relapse in leukaemia.. Abstract: Multidrug resistance (MDR) and disease relapse are challenging clinical problems in the treatment of leukaemia. Relapsed disease is frequently refractory to chemotherapy and exhibits multiple drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to identify the mechanism by which cancer cells develop resistance. In this study, we used microRNA (miRNA) microarray and qRT-PCR approaches to investigate the expression of miRNAs in three leukaemia cell lines with different degrees of resistance to doxorubicin (DOX) compared with their parent cell line, K562. The expression of miR-331-5p and miR-27a was inversely correlated with the expression of a drug-resistant factor, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in leukaemia cell lines with gradually increasing resistance. The development of drug resistance is regulated by the expression of the P-gp. Transfection of the K562 and, a human promyelocytic cell line (HL) HL60 DOX-resistant cells with miR-331-5p and miR-27a, separately or in combination, resulted in the increased sensitivity of cells to DOX, suggesting that correction of altered expression of miRNAs may be used for therapeutic strategies to overcome leukaemia cell resistance. Importantly, miR-331-5p and miR-27a were also expressed at lower levels in a panel of relapse patients compared with primary patients at diagnosis, further illustrating that leukaemia relapse might be a consequence of deregulation of miR-331-5p and miR-27a.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting Developmental Pathways: The Achilles Heel of Cancer?. Abstract: Developmental pathways (e.g., Notch, Hippo, Hedgehog, Wnt, and TGF-\u03b2/BMP/FGF) are networks of genes that act co-ordinately to establish the body plan, and disruptions of genes in one pathway can have effects in related pathways and may result in serious dysmorphogenesis or cancer. Interestingly, all developmental pathways are highly conserved cell signalling systems present in almost all multicellular organisms. In addition, they have a crucial role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and finally in organ development. Of note, almost all of these pathways promote oncogenesis through synergistic associations with the Hippo signalling pathway, and several lines of evidence have also indicated that these pathways (e.g., Wnt/\u03b2-catenin) may be implicated in checkpoint inhibitor resistance (e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1). Since Notch inhibition in vivo results in partial loss of its stemness features such as self-renewal, chemoresistance, invasive and migratory potential, and tumorigenesis, these highly conserved developmental pathways are regarded as being critical for regulation of self-renewal in both embryonic and adult stem cells and hence are likely to be implicated in the maintenance of cancer stem cells. Many small molecules are currently in preclinical and early clinical development, and only two compounds are approved for treatment of advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (vismodegib and sonidegib). Furthermore, therapeutic targeting of cancer stem cells using drugs that disrupt activated developmental pathways may also represent an attractive strategy that is potentially relevant to many types of malignancy, notably blood cancers, where the evidence for leukaemia stem cells is well established. Future work will hopefully pave the way for the development of new strategies for targeting these pervasive oncogenic pathways. Journal: Oncology. Year: 2017.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Comprehensive analyses of m6A regulators and interactive coding and non-coding RNAs across 32 cancer types.. Abstract: N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is an RNA modification that interacts with numerous coding and non-coding RNAs and plays important roles in the development of cancers. Nonetheless, the clinical impacts of m6A interactive genes on these cancers largely remain unclear since most studies focus only on a single cancer type. We comprehensively evaluated m6A modification patterns, including 23 m6A regulators and 83 interactive coding and non-coding RNAs among 9,804 pan-cancer samples. We used clustering analysis to identify m6A subtypes and constructed the m6A signature based on an unsupervised approach. We used the signatures to identify potential m6A modification targets across the genome. The prognostic value of one target was further validated in 3,444 samples from six external datasets. We developed three distinct m6A modification subtypes with different tumor microenvironment cell infiltration degrees: immunological, intermediate, and tumor proliferative. They were significantly associated with overall survival in 24 of 27 cancer types. Our constructed individual-level m6A signature was associated with survival, tumor mutation burden, and classical pathways. With the signature, we identified 114 novel genes as potential m6A targets. The gene shared most commonly between cancer types, BCL9L, is an oncogene and interacts with m6A patterns in the Wnt signaling pathway. In conclusion, m6A regulators and their interactive genes impact the outcome of various cancers. Evaluating the m6A subtype and the signature of individual tumors may inform the design of adjuvant treatments. Journal: Molecular cancer. Year: 2021. Authors: Shen S, Zhang R, Jiang Y, Li Y, Lin L.

Abstract: Prostate cancer, a slow-growing tumor, develops through the over-proliferation of malignant cells in the prostate and is one of the most common types of cancer. Active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation, brachytherapy, cryotherapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy are common treatment strategies for prostate cancer. However, resistance to treatment in advanced prostate cancer is a concerning issue in the use of these therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for prostate cancer is an emerging strategy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancers but the resistance and limited efficacy to ICIs observed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) raises concerns. The ongoing clinical trials for combination therapies for mCRPC have provided some hope. This review concisely discusses the molecular and cellular mechanisms, immunotherapy, the limitations of ICIs, combination therapies, and the prospects of developing novel therapeutics for prostate cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrated Whole-Exome and Transcriptome Sequencing of Sporadic Parathyroid Adenoma.. Abstract: Hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disease. Parathyroid adenoma (PA) accounts for approximately 85% of cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, but the molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Herein, we aimed to investigate the genetic and transcriptomic profiles of sporadic PA. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of 41 patients with PA and RNA-seq of 5 normal parathyroid tissues were performed. Gene mutations and characterized expression changes were identified. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying PA, unsupervised consensus clustering of RNA-seq data was performed. The correlations between the sequencing data and clinicopathological features of these patients were analyzed. Previously reported PA driver gene mutations, such as <i>MEN1</i> (9/41), <i>mTOR</i> (4/41), <i>ZFX</i> (3/41), <i>CASR</i> (3/41), <i>EZH2</i> (2/41) and <i>FAT1</i> (2/41), were also identified in our cohort. Furthermore, somatic mutation of <i>EZH1</i>, which had not been reported in PA, was found in 4 samples. RNA-seq showed that the expression levels of 84 genes were upregulated and 646 were downregulated in PA samples compared with normal samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis of RNA-seq data clustered these patients into 10 subgroups related to mutation or abnormal expression of a group of potential pathogenic genes. <i>MEN1</i>, <i>EZH2</i>, <i>CASR</i>, <i>EZH1, ZFX</i>, <i>mTOR</i> and <i>FAT1</i> mutations in PA were\u00a0revealed. According to the RNA-seq data clustering analysis, cyclin D1, \u03b2-catenin, VDR, CASR and GCM2 may be important factors contributing to the PA gene expression\u00a0profile.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting Cancer Metabolism and Current Anti-Cancer Drugs.. Abstract: Several studies have exploited the metabolic hallmarks that distinguish between normal and cancer cells, aiming at identifying specific targets of anti-cancer drugs. It has become apparent that metabolic flexibility allows cancer cells to survive during high anabolic demand or the depletion of nutrients and oxygen. Cancers can reprogram their metabolism to the microenvironments by increasing aerobic glycolysis to maximize ATP production, increasing glutaminolysis and anabolic pathways to support bioenergetic and biosynthetic demand during rapid proliferation. The increased key regulatory enzymes that support the relevant pathways allow us to design small molecules which can specifically block activities of these enzymes, preventing growth and metastasis of tumors. In this review, we discuss metabolic adaptation in cancers and highlight the crucial metabolic enzymes involved, specifically those involved in aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, de novo fatty acid synthesis, and bioenergetic pathways. Furthermore, we also review the success and the pitfalls of the current anti-cancer drugs which have been applied in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

Abstract: To identify the characteristics and outcomes associated with late relapse in stage I seminoma. A retrospective review was carried out of all patients with stage I seminoma managed at our institution between 1981 and 2011. Data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Late relapse was defined as tumour recurrence > 2 years after orchiectomy. Overall, 1060 stage I seminoma patients were managed with active surveillance (n=766) or adjuvant radiotherapy (n=294). At a median follow-up of 10.6 years (range 1.2-30), 142 patients relapsed at a median (range) of 14 (3-129) months; 128 on active surveillance and 14 after adjuvant radiotherapy. The late relapse rate for the active surveillance and adjuvant radiotherapy groups was 4% and 1%, respectively. There was no specific clinicopathological factor associated with late relapse. Isolated para-aortic node(s) was the most common relapse site in active surveillance patients either in late (88%) or early relapse (82%). Among the active surveillance group, no patients with late relapse subsequently developed a second relapse after either salvage radiotherapy (n=25) or chemotherapy (n=6), whereas in early relapse patients a second relapse was reported in seven (10%) of 72 patients treated with salvage radiotherapy and one (4%) of 23 patients who received chemotherapy; all second relapses were subsequently salvaged with chemotherapy. No patient in the adjuvant radiotherapy group developed a second relapse after salvage chemotherapy (n=10) or inguinal radiotherapy/surgery (n=4). Of seven deaths, only one was related to seminoma. Among active surveillance patients, the 10 year overall survival for late and early relapse groups were 100% and 96% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.2), whereas the 10 year cancer-specific survival rates were 100% and 99% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.3), respectively. In stage I seminoma, the extent and pattern of late relapse is similar to that for early relapse. For active surveillance patients, selective use of salvage radiotherapy/chemotherapy for relapse results in excellent outcomes regardless of the timing of relapse, whereas salvage radiotherapy for late relapse seems to be associated with a minimal risk of second relapse.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Optimal Strategy and Benefit of Pulsed Therapy Depend On Tumor Heterogeneity and Aggressiveness at Time of Treatment Initiation.. Abstract: Therapeutic resistance is a fundamental obstacle in cancer treatment. Tumors that initially respond to treatment may have a preexisting resistant subclone or acquire resistance during treatment, making relapse theoretically inevitable. Here, we investigate treatment strategies that may delay relapse using mathematical modeling. We find that for a single-drug therapy, pulse treatment-short, elevated doses followed by a complete break from treatment-delays relapse compared with continuous treatment with the same total dose over a length of time. For tumors treated with more than one drug, continuous combination treatment is only sometimes better than sequential treatment, while pulsed combination treatment or simply alternating between the two therapies at defined intervals delays relapse the longest. These results are independent of the fitness cost or benefit of resistance, and are robust to noise. Machine-learning analysis of simulations shows that the initial tumor response and heterogeneity at the start of treatment suffice to determine the benefit of pulsed or alternating treatment strategies over continuous treatment. Analysis of eight tumor burden trajectories of breast cancer patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center shows the model can predict time to resistance using initial responses to treatment and estimated preexisting resistant populations. The model calculated that pulse treatment would delay relapse in all eight cases. Overall, our results support that pulsed treatments optimized by mathematical models could delay therapeutic resistance. Journal: Molecular cancer therapeutics. Year: 2022.

Abstract: The retrospective study revealed the 15% relapse rate in patients with stage II-IV unfavorable prognosis Hodgkin lymphoma, 5-year OS in relapsed patients was 84%. Karnofsky score less than 80 (p=0,0001), more than 1 extranodal lesion (p=0,0004), extensive (equal to stage III-IV) involvement on relapse (p=0,001), b-symptoms on relapse (p=0,023), more than 5 lymph nodal lesions (p=0,027), albumin level less than 40 g per liter (p=0,037), detection of new nodal lesions (p=0,041) were shown by discriminative analysis as the therapy effect predictors in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma relapse. In patients with second-line therapy failure the actuarial survival rate was lower by 55% in comparison to patients with chemosensitive relapses (40% and 95%). The secondary therapy resistance was shown to be an unfavorable prognosis predictive factor (p=0,0001). The multifactorial overall survival analysis revealed the following adverse prognostic factors: failure of second-line treatment (p=0,0001), first early relapse (p=0,01), albumin level on relapse less than 40 g per liter (p=0,02), use of standard chemotherapy instead of irradiation (p=0,02). The relapse patients with 1 or less risk factors had 95% 5-year OS, the patients with 3 or more adverse risk factors had 70% OS (p=0,0002). The lowest 10-year OS was observed in patients with 2 or more adverse risk factors, 48% and 28% accordingly. Adverse risk factors must be considered while choosing the optimal treatment strategy aimed at better survival rate. Journal: Voprosy onkologii. Year: 2012.

Abstract: Cancer genomic medicine or cancer immunotherapy has led to a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. When the first treatment does not work, patients may be able to have second-line therapy or additional rounds of treatment after that, however, most advanced cancers eventually acquire resistance to those treatments. To stop this perpetual cycle, a deeper understanding of cancer evolutionary trajectories during the acquisition of therapeutic resistance is needed. We and others have recently provided evidence that non-genetic drug resistance is due to dormant persister cells, yet little is known about how persister cancer cells promote tumor relapse. To study the non-genetic evolution of cancer cells, a single-cell analysis will enable us to trace the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells. As persister cancer cells are considered to act as a reservoir for drug-resistant mutants, we may be able to overcome cancer relapse or metastasis if we can better understand their evolutionary trajectories.

Abstract: Tumor stem cells are quiescent and, therefore, resistant to therapy, yet harbor the capacity to replenish a tumor after therapy. Therefore, it is tempting to explain all therapeutic failures by the persistence of tumor stem cells. Yet, this explanation is relevant only to initial stages of stem-cell-dependent tumors (such as chronic myeloid leukemia) that, actually, are well controlled by therapy. In advanced cancers that poorly respond to therapy, quiescent tumor stem cells play a negligible role. Instead, proliferating cells determine disease progression, prognosis, therapeutic failures, and resistance to therapy. And therapy fails not because it eliminates only proliferating tumor cells, but because it does not eliminate them. With noticeable exceptions, it is the proliferating cell that should be targeted, whereas resting cancer cells including stem and dormant cells need to be targeted only when they 'wake up'. Finally, I discuss a strategy of selectively killing dominant proliferating clones, including proliferating stem-like and drug-resistant cancer cells, while sparing normal cells. Journal: Leukemia.

Abstract: Novel agents such as thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide have improved outcomes and extended survival in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). These agents appear to be most effective when used at first relapse rather than later in the treatment sequence; however, the optimal duration of therapy has not been defined. Continuous therapy from relapse to disease progression may be able to maintain suppression of residual disease, thereby extending overall survival. This article reviews the currently available data on treatments, including novel agents for patients with RRMM, focusing on the duration of therapy required to improve clinical outcomes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Clinical and Genomic Implications of Luminal and Basal Subtypes Across Carcinomas.. Abstract: Carcinomas originate from epithelial tissues, which have apical (luminal) and basal orientations. The degree of luminal versus basal differentiation in cancer has been shown to be biologically important in some carcinomas and impacts treatment response. Although prior studies have focused on individual cancer types, we used a modified clinical-grade classifier (PAM50) to subtype 8,764 tumors across 22 different carcinomas into luminal A, luminal B, and basal-like tumors. We found that all epithelial tumors demonstrated similar gene expression-based luminal/basal subtypes. As expected, basal-like tumors were associated with increased expression of the basal markers KRT5/6 and KRT14, and luminal-like tumors were associated with increased expression of the luminal markers KRT20. Luminal A tumors consistently had improved outcomes compared with basal across many tumor types, with luminal B tumors falling between the two. Basal tumors had the highest rates of TP53 and RB1 mutations and copy number loss. Luminal breast, cervical, ovarian, and endometrial tumors had increased ESR1 expression, and luminal prostate, breast, cervical, and bladder tumors had increased androgen receptor (AR) expression. Furthermore, luminal B tumors had the highest rates of AR and ESR1 mutations and had increased sensitivity <i>in vitro</i> to bicalutamide and tamoxifen. Luminal B tumors were more sensitive to gemcitabine, and basal tumors were more sensitive to docetaxel. This first pan-carcinoma luminal/basal subtyping across epithelial tumors reveals global similarities across carcinomas in the transcriptome, genome, clinical outcomes, and drug sensitivity, emphasizing the biological and translational importance of these luminal versus basal subtypes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Awakening the \"guardian of genome\": reactivation of mutant p53.. Abstract: The role of tumor suppressor protein p53 is undeniable in the suppression of cancer upon oncogenic stress. It induces diverse conditions such as cell-cycle arrest, cell death, and senescence to protect the cell from carcinogenesis. The rate of mutations in p53 gene nearly accounts for 50% of the human cancers. Upon mutations, the conformation gets altered and becomes non-native. Mutant p53 displays long half-life and accumulates in the nucleus and interacts with oncoproteins to promote carcinogenesis and these interactions present a formidable challenge for clinicians in therapy of the disease. Variety of approaches have been developed, through which native-like function of p53 can be restored, such as restoration of the native-like structure of p53, activating the p53 family members, etc. Modern scientific techniques have led to the discovery of a variety of molecules to reactivate mutant p53 and restore its transcriptional activity. These compounds include small molecules, various peptides, and phytochemicals. In this review article, we comprehensively discuss these molecules to reactivate mutant p53 to restore the normal function with a particular focus on molecular mechanisms.

Abstract: <i>microRNA-181a</i> (<i>miR-181a</i>) is a crucial post-transcriptional regulator of many mRNA transcripts and noncoding-RNAs, influencing cell proliferation, cancer cell stemness, apoptosis, and immune responses. Its abnormal expression is well-characterized in numerous cancers, establishing it as a significant genomic vulnerability and biomarker in cancer research. Here, we summarize <i>miR-181a</i>'s correlation with poor patient outcomes across numerous cancers and the mechanisms governing <i>miR-181a</i>'s activity and processing.

We also discuss current therapeutic approaches to targeting <i>miR-181a</i>, highlighting their limitations and future potential. <i>miR-181a</i> is a clinically relevant pan-cancer biomarker with potential as a therapeutic target. Its regulatory control of tumorigenic signaling pathways and immune responses positions it as a promising candidate for personalized treatments. The success of <i>miR-181a</i> as a target relies on the development of specific therapeutics platforms.

Abstract: Recurrence or metastasis of cancer has been considered to occur in the last stage of the patient's life. However, the new notions of oligometastases and oligo-recurrence have been proposed and the paradigm shift in the conceptualization of cancer metastasis or cancer recurrence. Oligometastases is the state in which the patient shows distant relapse in only a limited number of regions. Local therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation for the relapsed sites could thus improve patient's survival. On the other hand, oligo-recurrence is a notion similar to oligometastases. However, the conditions of oligo-recurrence has a primary site of the cancer controlled, meaning that all gross recurrent or metastatic sites could be treated using local therapy.

By adapting RNA-templated ligation probes, PERTURB-CAST leverages commercial 10X Visium spatial transcriptomics to integrate perturbation mapping with transcriptome-wide phenotyping in the same tissue section using a widely available single-readout platform. In addition, we present CHOCOLAT-G2P, a scalable framework designed to study higher-order combinatorial perturbations that mimic tumour heterogeneity.

Abstract: The outcomes of relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in developed countries have improved over time as a result of risk-adapted, minimal residual disease-directed therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy. There are few studies that have examined survival in relapsed childhood ALL in resource-limited countries. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prognostic factors and survival outcome of relapsed childhood ALL in a major tertiary center in Southern Thailand. The medical records of patients with ALL aged <15 years between January 2000 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to depict the overall survival (OS). A total of 472 patients with ALL were enrolled and relapsed ALL was found in 155 (32.8%) patients. Of these, 131 (84.5%) and 24 (15.5%) had B-cell and T-cell phenotypes, respectively. One hundred thirteen (72.9%) and 42 (27.1%) patients had early and late relapses, respectively. The most common site of relapse was bone marrow in 102 patients (65.8%). One hundred twenty-eight (82.6%) patients received treatment while 27 (17.4%) patients refused treatment. The 5-year OS of all relapsed patients was 11.9%. The 5-year OS among the patients with early relapse was significantly lower than in the patients with late relapse (5.3% vs. 29.1%, respectively, p <0.0001). Site and immunophenotype were not associated with survival of relapsed ALL. The median survival times among the patients who received and refused relapse chemotherapy were 11.8 and 3.1 months, respectively (p <0.0001). The relapse rate accounted for one third of patients with ALL with the 5-year OS of 12%. Early relapse and those who refused treatment were associated with poor survival outcome.

Abstract: In an attempt to identify potential new therapeutic targets, efforts to describe the metabolic features unique to cancer cells are increasingly being reported. Although current standard of care regimens for several pediatric malignancies incorporate agents that target tumor metabolism, these drugs have been part of the therapeutic landscape for decades. More recent research has focused on the identification and targeting of new metabolic vulnerabilities in pediatric cancers. The purpose of this review is to describe the most recent translational findings in the metabolic targeting of pediatric malignancies. Across multiple pediatric cancer types, dependencies on a number of key metabolic pathways have emerged through study of patient tissue samples and preclinical modeling. Among the potentially targetable vulnerabilities are glucose metabolism via glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid and polyamine metabolism, and NAD metabolism. Although few agents have yet to move forward into clinical trials for pediatric cancer patients, the robust and promising preclinical data that have been generated suggest that future clinical trials should rationally test metabolically targeted agents for relevant disease populations. Recent advances in our understanding of the metabolic dependencies of pediatric cancers represent a source of potential new therapeutic opportunities for these diseases.

Trastuzumab, an anti-Her2 antibody, was approved by the US FDA in 2010 as first-line therapy in combination with chemotherapy for Her2-positive disease. More recently, two Phase III second-line trials of ramucirumab, an anti-VEGF receptor 2 antibody, as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy showed improved survival. A prior Phase III evaluation of bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, with first-line chemotherapy was negative. While anti-EGFR therapy has been extensively investigated, completed Phase III trials suggest that this is not a promising target. Finally, MET inhibition appears to have significant clinical potential, and Phase III testing of an anti-MET pathway mAb is under way. Journal: Expert opinion on emerging drugs. Year: 2015.

Abstract: To examine the roles and mechanisms of tanshinone IIA (Tan-IIA) in colorectal cancer (CRC) using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and in vitro experiments. In network pharmacology studies, Tan-IIA targets for treating CRC were identified using public databases. Employing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, gene ontology (GO) enrichment, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, the core genes and mechanisms of action of Tan-IIA were obtained. Core targets were validated using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, the Human Protein Atlas, DriverDBv3, cBioPortal, and the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. Molecular docking validates the binding affinity of Tan-IIA to some key targets. Network pharmacology and molecular docking results were validated via in vitro experiments. Intersecting Tan-IIA and CRC targets led to the identification of 25 potential targets. PPI analysis identified 10 core targets of Tan-IIA for CRC treatment. Database validation revealed that these core targets were expressed at varying levels in both normal and cancer tissues. Their expression could influence patient prognosis and immune cell infiltration levels. GO analysis revealed 170 biological processes, 42 cellular components, and 83 molecular functions. KEGG analysis indicated that Tan-IIA affected CRC through multiple pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), cAMP, and TNF signaling pathways, with the PI3K/AKT pathway being the most enriched. Molecular docking results indicated that Tan-IIA effectively binds to PI3K, AKT, and other partial core targets. In vitro experiments revealed that Tan-IIA suppressed the multiplication and migration of HCT116 and SW480 cells, induced apoptosis, and reduced the PI3K/AKT pathway indicator protein expression, which was reversed by the PI3K/AKT pathway agonist insulin-like growth factor-1. Network pharmacology, molecular docking, and in vitro validation confirmed that Tan-IIA contributes to CRC treatment through the PI3K/AKT pathway, providing theoretical and experimental foundations for its potential clinical application.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeted Approaches to Treatment of Pleural Mesothelioma: A Review.. Abstract: Pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive disease that is enriched for inactivating alterations in tumor suppressor genes. Systemic therapeutic strategies for pleural mesothelioma generally involve chemotherapies and immunotherapies that are chosen without consideration of the tumor's molecular profile. As this generalized approach to treatment rarely yields durable responses, alternative therapeutic regimens are urgently indicated. Preclinical studies have identified synthetic lethal protein and metabolic interactions, recurrently overexpressed proteins, and frequent pathway perturbations that may be therapeutically exploited in mesothelioma. This review discusses the mechanism of action of emerging investigational therapies and summarizes findings from phase I-II clinical trials exploring selective, biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies for mesothelioma, with a focus on five common targets. Finally, using lessons learned from these clinical trials, imperatives for successful implementation of targeted therapy in mesothelioma are discussed. Journal: JCO precision oncology. Year: 2023.

This study was designed to identify transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures of breast cancer (BC) tumors from patients with any prior malignancy. RNA-sequencing and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from BCs were generated in the Cancer Genome Atlas project. Patients with secondary breast cancer (SBC) were separated by histological subtype and matched to primary breast cancer controls to create two independent cohorts of invasive ductal (IDC, n\u2009=\u200936) and invasive lobular (ILC, n\u2009=\u200940) carcinoma. Differentially expressed genes, as well as differentially methylated genomic regions, were integrated to identify epigenetically regulated abnormal gene pathways in SBCs. Differentially expressed genes were identified in IDC SBCs (n\u2009=\u2009727) and in ILC SBCs (n\u2009=\u2009261; Wilcoxon's test; P\u2009<\u20090.05). In IDC SBCs, 105 genes were upregulated and hypomethylated, including an estrogen receptor gene, and 73 genes were downregulated and hypermethylated, including genes involved in antigen presentation and interferon response pathways (HLA-E, IRF8, and RELA). In ILC SBCs, however, only 17 genes were synchronously hypomethylated and upregulated, whereas 46 genes hypermethylated and downregulated. Interestingly, the SBC gene expression signatures closely corresponded with each histological subtype with only 1.51% of genes overlapping between the two histological subtypes. Differential gene expression and DNA methylation signatures are seen in both IDC and ILC SBCs, including genes that are relevant to tumor growth and proliferation. Differences in gene expression signatures corresponding with each histological subtype emphasize the importance of disease subtype-specific evaluations of molecular alterations.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Advances in the discovery of microRNA-based anticancer therapeutics: latest tools and developments.. Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding RNAs that repress the expression of their target genes by reducing mRNA stability and/or inhibiting translation. miRNAs are known to be aberrantly regulated in cancers. Modulators of miRNA (mimics and antagonists) have emerged as novel therapeutic tools for cancer treatment.<b>Areas covered</b>: This review summarizes the various strategies that have been applied to correct the dysregulated miRNA in cancer cells. The authors also discuss the recent advances in the technical development and preclinical/clinical evaluation of miRNA-based therapeutic agents.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Application of miRNA-based therapeutics for cancer treatment is appealing because they are able to modulate multiple dysregulated genes and/or signaling pathways in cancer cells. Major obstacles hindering their clinical development include drug delivery, off-target effects, efficacious dose determination, and safety. Tumor site-specific delivery of novel miRNA therapeutics may help to minimize off-target effects and toxicity. Combination of miRNA therapeutics with other anticancer treatment modalities could provide a synergistic effect, thus allowing the use of lower dose, minimizing off-target effects, and improving the overall safety profile in cancer patients. It is critical to identify individual miRNAs with cancer type-specific and context-specific regulation of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes in order to facilitate the precise use of miRNA anticancer therapeutics.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Emerging therapeutics targeting tumor-associated macrophages for the treatment of solid organ cancers.. Abstract: Over the last decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4, which reinvigorate T cells for tumor control have become standard-of-care treatment options. In response to the increasingly recognized mechanisms of resistance to T cell activation in immunologically cold tumors, immuno-oncology drug development has started to shift beyond T cell approaches. These include tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a major pro-tumor immune cell population in the tumor microenvironment known to silence immune responses. Here we outline anti-TAM therapies in current development, either as monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities. We describe emerging drugs targeting TAMs under investigation in phase II and III testing with a focus on their distinguishing mechanism of action which include (1) reprogramming of TAMs toward anti-tumor function and immune surveillance, (2) blockade of recruitment, and (3) reduction and ablation of TAMs. Several new immuno-oncology agents are under investigation to harness anti-tumor functions of TAMs. While robust anti-tumor efficacy of anti-TAM therapies across advanced solid organ cancers remains elusive to-date, TAM reprogramming therapies have yielded benefits in select cancers. The inherent heterogeneity of the diverse TAM population will require enhanced investments into biomarker-driven approaches to fully leverage its therapeutic potential.

Abstract: In recent years, cultural changes in today's society and improved risk assessment have increased the indication for mastectomies in women with breast cancer. Various studies have confirmed the oncological safety of sparing mastectomies and immediate reconstruction. The objective of this study is to analyze the incidence of locoregional relapses of this procedure and its impact on reconstruction and overall survival. Prospective study of patients with breast carcinoma who underwent a sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. Locoregional relapses and their treatment and their impact on survival were analyzed. The study group is made up of 271 women with breast carcinoma treated with a skin-sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. The mean follow-up was 7.98 years and during the same 18 locoregional relapses (6.6%) were diagnosed: 72.2% in the mastectomy flap and 27.8% lymph node. There were no significant differences in the pathological characteristics of the primary tumor between patients with and without locoregional relapse, although the percentage of women with hormone-sensitive tumors was higher in the group without relapse. Patients with lymph node relapse had larger tumors (80% T2-T3) and 60% had axillary metastases at diagnosis, compared to 7.7% of women with skin relapse (p\u2009=\u20090.047). All patients operated on for locoregional relapse preserved their reconstruction. The incidence of metastases and deaths was significantly higher in patients with a relapse, causing a non-significant decrease in overall survival. Locoregional relapses are a rare event in women with a sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. Most patients with locoregional relapse can preserve their initial reconstruction through local resection of the tumor and adjuvant and / or neoadjuvant therapies. Journal: Cirugia espanola.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: MEDICI: Mining Essentiality Data to Identify Critical Interactions for Cancer Drug Target Discovery and Development.. Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) mediate the transmission and regulation of oncogenic signals that are essential to cellular proliferation and survival, and thus represent potential targets for anti-cancer therapeutic discovery. Despite their significance, there is no method to experimentally disrupt and interrogate the essentiality of individual endogenous PPIs. The ability to computationally predict or infer PPI essentiality would help prioritize PPIs for drug discovery and help advance understanding of cancer biology. Here we introduce a computational method (MEDICI) to predict PPI essentiality by combining gene knockdown studies with network models of protein interaction pathways in an analytic framework. Our method uses network topology to model how gene silencing can disrupt PPIs, relating the unknown essentialities of individual PPIs to experimentally observed protein essentialities. This model is then deconvolved to recover the unknown essentialities of individual PPIs. We demonstrate the validity of our approach via prediction of sensitivities to compounds based on PPI essentiality and differences in essentiality based on genetic mutations. We further show that lung cancer patients have improved overall survival when specific PPIs are no longer present, suggesting that these PPIs may be potentially new targets for therapeutic development.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Decoding Insulin-Like Growth Factor Signaling Pathway From a Non-coding RNAs Perspective: A Step Towards Precision Oncology in Breast Cancer.. Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is a highly complex and heterogenous disease. Several oncogenic signaling pathways drive BC oncogenic activity, thus hindering scientists to unravel the exact molecular pathogenesis of such multifaceted disease. This highlights the urgent need to find a key regulator that tunes up such intertwined oncogenic drivers to trim the malignant transformation process within the breast tissue. The Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway is a tenacious axis that is heavily intertwined with BC where it modulates the amplitude and activity of vital downstream oncogenic signaling pathways. Yet, the complexity of the pathway and the interactions driven by its different members seem to aggravate its oncogenicity and hinder its target-ability. In this review, the authors shed the light on the stubbornness of the IGF signaling pathway and its potential regulation by non-coding RNAs in different BC subtypes. Nonetheless, this review also spots light on the possible transport systems available for efficient delivery of non-coding RNAs to their respective targets to reach a personalized treatment code for BC patients.

Abstract: We studied whether chemokines may have a role in relapses in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We compared the levels of chemokine receptors in marrow samples from 82 children with ALL at diagnosis versus 15 at relapses, and quantified the levels of chemokines in central system fluid (CSF) samples. The functional role of specific chemokines was studied in vitro and in vivo. The expression of some chemokine receptors was upregulated upon leukemic relapse, both in B- and in T-ALL, and in cases of medullary and extramedullary involvement. CXCL10 induced chemotaxis in leukemic cell lines and in primary leukemic cells, depending upon the levels of CXCR3 expression. CXCL10 specifically diminished chemotherapy-induced apoptosis on ALL cells expressing CXCR3, partially inhibiting caspase activation and maintaining the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Finally, immunodeficient mice engrafted with CXCR3-expressing human leukemic cells showed decreased infiltration of marrow, spleen, and CNS after receiving a CXCR3-antagonist molecule. CXCR3 signaling in ALL may have a dual function: chemotactic for the localisation of leukemic blasts in specific niches, and it may also confer resistance to chemotherapy, enhancing the chances for relapses.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: GLassonet: Identifying Discriminative Gene Sets Among Molecular Subtypes of Breast Cancer.. Abstract: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease caused by various alterations in the genome or transcriptome. Molecular subtypes of breast cancer have been reported, but useful biomarkers remain to be identified to uncover underlying biological mechanisms and guide clinical decisions. Towards biomarker discovery, several studies focus on genomic alterations that provide differences, while few works concern transcriptomic characterizations that mediate tumor progression. Rather than using differential expression (DE) or weighted network analysis, we propose a feature selection method, dubbed GLassonet, to identify discriminative biomarkers from transcriptome-wide expression profiles by embedding the relationship graph of high-dimensional expressions into the Lassonet model. GLassonet comprises a nonlinear neural network for identifying cancer subtypes, a skipping fully connected layer for canceling the connections of hidden layers from input features to output categories, and a graph enhancement for preserving the discriminative graph into the selected subspace. First, an iterative optimization algorithm learns model parameters on the TCGA breast cancer dataset to investigate the classification performance. Then, we probe the distribution patterns of GLassonet-selected gene sets across the cancer subtypes and compare them to gene sets outputted from the state-of-the-art. More profoundly, we conduct the overall survival analysis on three GLassonet-selected new marker genes, i.e., SOX10, TPX2, and TUBA1C, to investigate their expression changes and assess their prognostic impacts. Finally, we perform the enrichment analysis to discover the functional associations of the GLassonet-selected genes with GO terms and KEGG pathways. Experimental results show that GLassonet has a powerful ability to select the discriminative genes, which improve cancer subtype classification performance and provide potential biomarkers for cancer personalized therapy.

Abstract: Advancements are constantly being made in oncology, improving prevention and treatment of cancers. To help reduce the impact and deadliness of cancers, they must be detected early. Additionally, there is a risk of cancers recurring after potentially curative treatments are performed. Predictive models can be built using historical patient data to model the characteristics of patients that developed cancer or relapsed. These models can then be deployed into clinical settings to determine if new patients are at high risk for cancer development or recurrence. For large-scale predictive models to be built, structured data must be captured for a wide range of diverse patients. This paper explores current methods for building cancer risk models using structured clinical patient data. Trends in statistical and machine learning techniques are explored, and gaps are identified for future research. The field of cancer risk prediction is a high-impact one, and research must continue for these models to be embraced for clinical decision support of both practitioners and patients.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in cancer: Update on effectors and inhibitors.. Abstract: The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is a family of proteins that is implicated in many vital cellular functions such as stem cell regeneration and organogenesis. Several intra-cellular signal transduction pathways are induced by Wnt, notably the Wnt/beta-catenin dependent pathway or canonical pathway and the non-canonical or beta-catenin-independent pathway; the latter includes the Wnt/Ca2+\u202fand Planar Cell Polarity pathway (PCP). Wnt activation occurs at the intestinal crypt floor, and is critical to optimal maintenance of stem cells. Colorectal cancers show evidence of Wnt signaling pathway activation and this is associated with loss of function of the tumor regulator APC. Wnt activation has been observed in breast, lung, and hematopoietic malignancies and contributes to tumor recurrence. The Wnt pathway cross talks with the Notch and Sonic Hedgehog pathways, which has implications for therapeutic interventions in cancers. There are significant challenges in targeting the Wnt pathway, including finding agents that are efficacious without damaging the system of normal somatic stem cell function in cellular repair and tissue homeostasis. Here, we comprehensively review the Wnt pathway and its interactions with the Notch and Sonic Hedgehog pathways. We present the state of the field in effectors and inhibitors of Wnt signaling, including updates on clinical trials in various cancers with inhibitors of Wnt, Notch, and Sonic Hedgehog.

Abstract: Talin is an intracellular cytoskeletal protein and one of the major components of the focal adhesion complex. It mainly acts as an interlink between transmembrane integrin receptors and cytosolic F-actin. Apart from integrins and actin, it also interacts with various other proteins in the adhesion complex to regulate their functional dynamics. Talin undergoes a variety of post-translational modifications and they are implicated in the control of cell motility. There are two talin isoforms (talin1 and talin2) in mammals and they are encoded by TLN1 and TLN2 genes, respectively. Recent studies showed that both the isoforms have some mechanistic dissimilarities in terms of their interaction with membrane-bound integrins. Among the two isoforms, talin1 was well studied, and most of the information available till now comes from talin1. The present review is aimed to provide an updated overview on the cellular significance of talin in normal and cancerous cells. Journal: Current drug metabolism. Year: 2020.

Abstract: The mevalonate (MVA) pathway plays a critical role in cholesterol biosynthesis, protein prenylation, and metabolic reprogramming, all of which contribute to cancer progression and therapy resistance. Targeting the MVA pathway with statins and other inhibitors has shown promise in preclinical studies; however, clinical outcomes remain controversial, raising concerns about translating these findings into effective treatments. Additionally, the interaction between the MVA pathway and radiation therapy (RT) is not yet fully understood, as RT upregulates the pathway, which can enhance tumor cell survival. This review summarizes the current literature on MVA pathway inhibition in cancer therapy, focusing on its potential to enhance the efficacy of RT. A better understanding of the pathway's role in radiation responses will be essential to translate combination therapies that target this pathway.

The landscape of RAS inhibitor therapies is rapidly evolving, with two mutant-selective KRAS inhibitors now approved and multiple other mutant-selective, pan-KRAS, and pan-RAS inhibitors in development. However, monotherapy efficacy has been limited by primary and acquired resistance. In this article, we review preclinical and clinical data on RAS inhibition in cancer and describe multiple genetic and nongenetic mechanisms of resistance. Moreover, we highlight future opportunities for the design of rational combination therapy strategies, which will ultimately be needed to overcome resistance and enhance the efficacy of these promising treatments. RAS inhibitors have shown early evidence of efficacy in multiple cancer types, but clinical benefit is limited by acquired resistance. Development of best-in-class inhibitors, with optimal potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties, as well as effective and tolerable combination therapies will be needed to overcome resistance and maximize the clinical impact of RAS-targeted therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Identifying cellular cancer mechanisms through pathway-driven data integration.. Abstract: Cancer is a genetic disease in which accumulated mutations of driver genes induce a functional reorganization of the cell by reprogramming cellular pathways. Current approaches identify cancer pathways as those most internally perturbed by gene expression changes. However, driver genes characteristically perform hub roles between pathways. Therefore, we hypothesize that cancer pathways should be identified by changes in their pathway-pathway relationships. To learn an embedding space that captures the relationships between pathways in a healthy cell, we propose pathway-driven non-negative matrix tri-factorization. In this space, we determine condition-specific (i.e. diseased and healthy) embeddings of pathways and genes. Based on these embeddings, we define our 'NMTF centrality' to measure a pathway's or gene's functional importance, and our 'moving distance', to measure the change in its functional relationships. We combine both measures to predict 15 genes and pathways involved in four major cancers, predicting 60 gene-cancer associations in total, covering 28 unique genes. To further exploit driver genes' tendency to perform hub roles, we model our network data using graphlet adjacency, which considers nodes adjacent if their interaction patterns form specific shapes (e.g. paths or triangles). We find that the predicted genes rewire pathway-pathway interactions in the immune system and provide literary evidence that many are druggable (15/28) and implicated in the associated cancers (47/60). We predict six druggable cancer-specific drug targets. The code and data are available at: https://gitlab.bsc.es/swindels/pathway_driven_nmtf.

Median survival ranges from as little as 6 to 9 months, and responses to treatment are characteristically short. Patients with relapsed/refractory disease are defined as those who, having achieved minor response or better, relapse and then progress while on salvage therapy, or experience progression within 60 days of their last therapy. In the era prior to the development of novel biologically based therapies for MM, relapse from successive treatment regimens resulted in progressively shorter response durations, which typically reflected emerging drug resistance, as well as changes in disease biology within each patient, with tumor cells expressing a more aggressive phenotype, higher proliferative fraction and lower apoptotic rates. Both bortezomid- and lenalidomide-based therapies are expecially active, with bortezomib in particular being shown to provide a platform for combinations able to overcome resistance in this setting. The addition of novel and conventional agents to the treatment backbone of lenalidomide, thalidomide, and bortezomib are areas of active study, with participation in clincial trials a clear priority for such patients. Clinical challenges in the relapsed/refractory population include light chain and IgA isotype, renal failure, extramedullary disease, hyposecretory myeloma, and advanced bone disease.

Abstract: Relapse is the leading cause of mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among chemotherapeutics, thiopurines are key drugs in ALL combination therapy. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified relapse-specific mutations in the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS1), which encodes a rate-limiting purine biosynthesis enzyme, in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL) cases. All individuals who harbored PRPS1 mutations relapsed early during treatment, and mutated ALL clones expanded exponentially before clinical relapse. Our functional analyses of PRPS1 mutants uncovered a new chemotherapy-resistance mechanism involving reduced feedback inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis and competitive inhibition of thiopurine activation. Notably, the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor lometrexol effectively abrogated PRPS1 mutant-driven drug resistance. These results highlight the importance of constitutive activation of the de novo purine synthesis pathway in thiopurine resistance, and they offer therapeutic strategies for the treatment of relapsed and thiopurine-resistant ALL.

Abstract: Drug delivery to select therapeutic targets for precision oncology has always been a major challenge in oncology. Anti-body drug conjugates (ADC) and radiopharmaceuticals attempt to overcome the major limitations of chemotherapy or mono-clonal antibody therapy as they provide a highly specific means of attacking the vulnerability of the cancer cell. Currently there are over 100 clinical trials in various stages of development with these agents. Years of improved understanding of ADC technology and addressing previous failures have yielded the current pipeline of ADCs with better design. The near future of ADC developmental therapeutics includes firstly continuing to improve drug design, secondly picking right targets, thirdly balancing efficacy vs toxicity, fourth understanding innate and acquired resistance mechanisms, fifth development of ADCs across pan-cancers as tissue-agnostic therapeutics, and lastly combination strategies. There is considerable excitement in the ADC developmental therapeutics and ADCs including radiopharmaceuticals are here to stay and offer to expand our pipeline of effective drugs to combat cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Combination of paclitaxel, bevacizumab and MEK162 in second line treatment in platinum-relapsing patient derived ovarian cancer xenografts.. Abstract: Advanced ovarian cancer is very responsive to first line platinum therapy, however almost invariably it relapses with a resistant disease. We have reported that patient derived ovarian xenografts (PDXs), independently from the degree of the initial response to cisplatin (DDP), show a significantly lower response to a second DDP cycle. We here report the effect of new combination regimens containing a MEK inhibitor (MEK), bevacizumab (BEV) and paclitaxel (PTX) as second line therapy in platinum-relapsing PDXs.We selected three DDP-relapsing PDX models based on the presence of activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK axis, mutated p53, lack of PTEN expression and activation of the PI3K pathway. In all the selected xenograft models, the antitumor efficacy of the doublets can be summarized as PTX/BEV\u2009>\u2009BEV/MEK\u2009>\u2009PTX/MEK and the antitumor activity of the triple combination was higher than any double combination. All the different combinations were well tolerated. The present data corroborate the activity of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of relapsing ovarian tumors and suggest that the addition of another targeted agents (MEK inhibitor) can further increase the antitumor activity without any increase in toxicity. PDX models represent a useful model to test second line therapy after failure of DDP first line. Journal: Molecular cancer. Year: 2017. Authors: Ricci F, Guffanti F, Damia G, Broggini M.

Abstract: Radiation-induced organizing pneumonia (RIOP) is an important complication of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer. Unfortunately, conventional corticosteroid therapy is frequently associated with relapses. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the outcomes of steroid treatment in patients with RIOP. In total, 26 patients diagnosed with RIOP from among 2404 women who received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer were included and classified into steroid (n = 7) and nonsteroid (n = 19) groups. Serum, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage composition; subjective symptoms (cough, fever, and dyspnea); migratory progression; and RIOP relapse were compared between the groups. Treatment type did not affect the duration of the subjective symptoms, which was 1.6 and 1.7 months for the steroid and nonsteroid groups, respectively. In contrast, RIOP relapse and new pulmonary lesions developed in five patients in the steroid group and only three patients in the nonsteroid group (P = 0.014). By assessing RIOP duration as the time to resolution of symptoms and discontinuation of therapy, the median duration of RIOP was significantly longer in the steroid (17.1 months) than that in the nonsteroid group (2.3 months, P = 0.005), primarily because of frequent relapses. After remission, persistent pulmonary dysfunction did not occur in the nonsteroid group. This single-center retrospective study demonstrates that steroid therapy results in frequent relapses and significantly prolongs RIOP duration. Corticosteroid treatment is considered a critical factor in RIOP recurrence. Journal: Cancer medicine. Year: 2014. Authors: Otani K, Nishiyama K, Ito Y, Kawaguchi Y, Inaji H.

The initial treatment of radiotherapy and chemotherapy are more sensitive, high remission rate, but susceptible to drug resistance and relapse after treatment. Although the treatment of lung cancer has undergone enormous changes in recent years, treatment for relapsed SCLC is still a difficult problem in clinical field. In view of the serious resistance of recurrent SCLC to the existing chemotherapeutic drugs, the research on recurrent SCLC around the world is focused on the clinical trial of new drug development, optimization of chemotherapy regimen and target drug development. This paper summarize and estimate studies and literature reports of chemotherapy and precision therapy for relapsed SCLC, hopefully it could help clinicians treat relapsed SCLC and give us clinical research direction for relapsed SCLC in the future.

Abstract: Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the leading cause of deaths of childhood cancer. Although relapse usually happens in the bone marrow, extramedullary relapse occasionally occurs including either the central nervous system or testis (<1-2%). We selected two pediatric ALL patients who experienced testicular relapse and interrogated their leukemic cells with exome sequencing. The sequencing results and clonality analyses suggest that relapse of patient D483 directly evolved from the leukemic clone at diagnosis which survived chemotherapy. In contrast, relapse leukemia cells (both bone marrow and testis) of patient D727 were likely derived from a common ancestral clone, and testicular relapse likely arose independently from the bone marrow relapsed leukemia. Our findings decipher the mutational spectra and shed light on the clonal evolution of two cases of pediatric ALL with testicular relapse. Presence of CREBBP/NT5C2 mutations suggests that a personalized therapeutic approach should be applied to these two patients. Journal: Journal of hematology & oncology. Year: 2017.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I like receptor pathway in cancer: modification and treatment.. Abstract: Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) like receptor (RLR) pathway is one of the most significant pathways supervising aberrant RNA in cells. In predominant conditions, the RLR pathway initiates anti-infection function via activating inflammatory effects, while recently it is discovered to be involved in cancer development as well, acting as a virus-mimicry responder. On one hand, the product IFNs induces tumor elimination. On the other hand, the NF-\u03baB pathway is activated which may lead to tumor progression. Emerging evidence demonstrates that a wide range of modifications are involved in regulating RLR pathways in cancer, which either boost tumor suppression effect or prompt tumor development. This review summarized current epigenetic modulations including DNA methylation, histone modification, and ncRNA interference, as well as post-transcriptional modification like m6A and A-to-I editing of the upstream ligand dsRNA in cancer cells. The post-translational modulations like phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of the pathway's key components were also discussed. Ultimately, we provided an overview of the current therapeutic strategies targeting the RLR pathway in cancers. Journal: Frontiers in immunology. Year: 2023.

Over the past decade, large-scale integrative genomics efforts have enhanced our understanding of this disease by characterizing its genetic and epigenetic landscape in thousands of patients<sup>2,3</sup>. However, most tumours profiled in these studies were obtained from patients from Western populations. Here we produced and analysed whole-genome, whole-transcriptome and DNA methylation data for 208 pairs of tumour tissue samples and matched healthy control tissue from Chinese patients with primary prostate cancer. Systematic comparison with published data from 2,554 prostate tumours revealed that the genomic alteration signatures in Chinese patients were markedly distinct from those of Western cohorts: specifically, 41% of tumours contained mutations in FOXA1 and 18% each had deletions in ZNF292 and CHD1. Alterations of the genome and epigenome were correlated and were predictive of disease phenotype and progression. Coding and noncoding mutations, as well as epimutations, converged on pathways that are important for prostate cancer, providing insights into this devastating disease. These discoveries underscore the importance of including population context in constructing comprehensive genomic maps for disease. Journal: Nature. Year: 2020.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are naturally resistant to chemotherapy, explaining why tumor relapse frequently occurs after initial regression upon administration of chemotherapeutic agents in most cases. A CSC population characterized by CD13 expression has been identified in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the current study, we aimed to clarify the molecular mechanism by which it escapes conventional therapies. Here, we used flow cytometry to examine the percentage of CD13+ CSCs in HepG2 and HuH7 cells after chemotherapy. Using in vitro isotope labeling technique, we compared metabolic pathways between CD13+ and CD13- subpopulations. Using co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting, we determined the target expressions in protein levels under different conditions. We also performed immunohistochemistry to detect the target proteins under different conditions. Animal models were constructed to verify the potential role of tyrosine metabolism in post-chemotherapeutic relapse in vivo. We observed that quiescent CD13+ CSCs are enriched after chemotherapy in HCCs, and serve as a reservoir for recurrence. Mechanistically, CD13+ CSCs were dependent on aerobic metabolism of tyrosine rather than glucose as energy source. Tyrosine metabolism also generated nuclear acetyl-CoA to acetylate and stabilize Foxd3, thereby allowing CD13+ CSCs cells to sustain quiescence and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. These findings encourage further exploration of eliminating CD13+ cells by targeting specific metabolic pathways to prevent recurrence in HCCs. Journal: Cancer research and treatment. Year: 2020.

As potent therapeutics are still awaited for the successful treatment of cancer, some unconventional treatments like radiotherapy, surgery, and chemotherapy and some advanced technologies like gene therapy, stem cell therapy, natural antioxidants, targeted therapy, photodynamic therapy, nanoparticles, and precision medicine are available to diagnose and treat cancer. In the present scenario, the prime focus is on developing efficient nanomedicines to treat cancer. Although stem cell therapy has the capability to target primary as well as metastatic cancer foci, it also has the ability to repair and regenerate injured tissues. However, nanoparticles are designed to have such novel therapeutic capabilities. Targeted therapy is also now available to arrest the growth and development of cancer cells without damaging healthy tissues. Another alternative approach in this direction is photodynamic therapy (PDT), which has more potential to treat cancer as it does minimal damage and does not limit other technologies, as in the case of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The best possible way to treat cancer is by developing novel therapeutics through translational research. In the present scenario, an important event in modern oncology therapy is the shift from an organ-centric paradigm guiding therapy to complete molecular investigations. The lacunae in anticancer therapy may be addressed through the creation of contemporary and pertinent cancer therapeutic techniques. In the meantime, the growth of nanotechnology, material sciences, and biomedical sciences has revealed a wide range of contemporary therapies with intelligent features, adaptable functions, and modification potential. The development of numerous therapeutic techniques for the treatment of cancer is summarized in this article. Additionally, it can serve as a resource for oncology and immunology researchers.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Combination strategies with PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated triple-negative breast cancer: overcoming resistance mechanisms.. Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive breast cancer subtype, characterised by a higher incidence in younger women, rapid metastasis, and a generally poor prognosis. Patients with TNBC and BRCA mutations face additional therapeutic challenges due to the cancer's intrinsic resistance to conventional therapies. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) have emerged as a promising targeted treatment for BRCA-mutated TNBC, exploiting vulnerabilities in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway. However, despite initial success, the efficacy of PARPis is often compromised by the development of resistance mechanisms, including HRR restoration, stabilisation of replication forks, reduced PARP1 trapping, and drug efflux. This review explores latest breakthroughs in overcoming PARPi resistance through combination therapies. These strategies include the integration of PARPis with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, antibody-drug conjugates, and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors. These combinations aim to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PARPis by targeting multiple cancer progression pathways. The review also discusses the evolving role of PARPis within the broader treatment paradigm for BRCA-mutated TNBC, emphasising the need for ongoing research and clinical trials to optimise combination strategies. By tackling the challenges associated with PARPi resistance and exploring novel combination therapies, this review sheds light on the future possibilities for improving outcomes for patients with BRCA-mutated TNBC.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing technology and complementary genomic platforms have transformed our capacity to interrogate the molecular landscapes of human cancers, including childhood brain tumors. Numerous high-throughput genomic studies have been reported for the major histologic brain tumor entities diagnosed in children, including interrogations at the level of the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome, many of which have yielded essential new insights into disease biology. The nature of these discoveries has been largely platform dependent, exemplifying the usefulness of applying different genomic and computational strategies, or integrative approaches, to address specific biologic and/or clinical questions. The goal of this article is to summarize the spectrum of molecular profiling methods available for investigating genomic aspects of childhood brain tumors in both the research and the clinical setting. We provide an overview of the main next-generation sequencing and array-based technologies currently being applied in this field and draw from key examples in the recent neuro-oncology literature to illustrate how these genomic approaches have profoundly advanced our understanding of individual tumor entities. Moreover, we discuss the current status of genomic profiling in the clinic and how different platforms are being used to improve patient diagnosis and stratification, as well as to identify actionable targets for informing molecularly guided therapies, especially for patients for whom conventional standard-of-care treatments have failed. Both the demand for genomic testing and the main challenges associated with incorporating genomics into the clinical management of pediatric patients with brain tumors are discussed, as are recommendations for incorporating these assays into future clinical trials.

Abstract: Aneuploidy is a common feature of cancer that drives tumor evolution, but it also creates cellular vulnerabilities that might be exploited therapeutically. Recent advances in genomic technologies and experimental models have uncovered diverse cellular consequences of aneuploidy, revealing dependencies on mitotic regulation, DNA replication and repair, proteostasis, metabolism, and immune interactions. Harnessing aneuploidy for precision oncology requires the combination of genomic, functional, and clinical studies that will enable translation of our improved understanding of aneuploidy to targeted therapies. In this review we discuss approaches to targeting both highly aneuploid cells and cells with specific common aneuploidies, summarize the biological underpinning of these aneuploidy-induced vulnerabilities, and explore their therapeutic implications.

Abstract: In the last decade, targeted therapies have shown rapid advancement in biliary tract cancer (BTC). Today, many targeted agents are available and under investigation for patients with BTC. More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) such as durvalumab and pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (gem/cis) have resulted in improved overall survival and progression-free survival in the first-line setting. However, the efficacy benefit of these novel therapeutics is often short-lived, with literature outlining concerns about both primary and secondary resistance to these agents. Investigators also need to consider toxicity profiles that can emerge using this strategy. There have been efforts to reduce evolving resistance through combinatory approaches, both pre-clinically and in early clinical settings. This review summarizes the emerging targeted therapies in BTC, evolving biomarkers of resistance, strategies to overcome them, and an analysis of ongoing clinical trials of patients with advanced BTC.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Establishment of tumor inflammasome clusters with distinct immunogenomic landscape aids immunotherapy.. Abstract: Inflammasome signaling is a reaction cascade that influences immune response and cell death. Although the inflammasomes participate in tumorigenesis, their role as an oncogenic booster or a tumor suppresser is still controversial. Therefore, it is important to comprehensively investigate the inflammasome signaling status across various cancers to clarify its clinical and therapeutic significance. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 9881 patients across 33 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were included in this study. Five gene sets were identified to step-wisely profile inflammasome signaling. Unsupervised clustering was used for sample classification based on gene set enrichment. Machine learning and <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments were used to confirm the implications of inflammasome classification. <b>Results:</b> A hundred and forty-one inflammasome-signaling-related genes were identified to construct five gene sets representing the sensing, activation, and termination steps of the inflammasome signaling. Six inflammasome clusters were robustly established with distinct molecular, biological, clinical, and therapeutic features. Importantly, clusters with inflammasome signaling activation were found to be immunosuppressive and resistant to ICB treatment. Inflammasome inhibition reverted the therapeutic failure of ICB in inflammasome-activated tumors. Moreover, based on the proposed classification and therapeutic implications, an open website was established to provide tumor patients with comprehensive information on inflammasome signaling. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study conducted a systematical investigation on inflammasome signaling in various tumor types. These findings highlight the importance of inflammasome evaluation in tumor classification and provide a foundation for improving relevant therapeutic regimens. Journal: Theranostics. Year: 2021.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Disrupting Siglec-mediated interactions to develop immunotherapies for cancer treatment.. Abstract: Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have improved patient outcomes, even in advanced stages of the disease. However, the effectiveness of current cancer immunotherapies remains limited to a small subset of patients because of resistance and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Research performed during the last years have identified immunosuppressive interactions between sialic acid-containing glycans and sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptors as a potential new, targetable pathway to overcome resistance to immunotherapy. In addition, activatory Siglecs could be engaged to enhance anti-tumor immunity. In this review, we summarize accumulating preclinical evidence demonstrating the immunosuppressive role of sialoglycan-Siglec interactions in cancer. Additionally, we provide an overview of potential therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting this immunosuppressive axis, including interventions currently being evaluated in early-phase clinical trials. Preclinical data strongly suggests that disrupting sialic acid-Siglec interactions could significantly improve cancer immunotherapy, in particular by changing the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Further biological understanding is needed to successfully develop new therapeutics. First trials are running that target these interactions and will hopefully inform, which patients are benefitting from this treatment. Journal: Expert opinion on therapeutic targets. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Proteomics holds promise for individualizing cancer treatment. We analyzed to what extent the proteomic landscape of human colorectal cancer (CRC) is maintained in established CRC cell lines and the utility of proteomics for predicting therapeutic responses. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed on 44 CRC cell lines, compared against primary CRCs (n=95) and normal tissues (n=60), and integrated with genomic and drug sensitivity data. Cell lines mirrored the proteomic aberrations of primary tumors, in particular for intrinsic programs. Tumor relationships of protein expression with DNA copy number aberrations and signatures of post-transcriptional regulation were recapitulated in cell lines. The 5 proteomic subtypes previously identified in tumors were represented among cell lines. Nonetheless, systematic differences between cell line and tumor proteomes were apparent, attributable to stroma, extrinsic signaling, and growth conditions. Contribution of tumor stroma obscured signatures of DNA mismatch repair identified in cell lines with a hypermutation phenotype. Global proteomic data showed improved utility for predicting both known drug-target relationships and overall drug sensitivity as compared with genomic or transcriptomic measurements. Inhibition of targetable proteins associated with drug responses further identified corresponding synergistic or antagonistic drug combinations. Our data provide evidence for CRC proteomic subtype-specific drug responses. Proteomes of established CRC cell line are representative of primary tumors. Proteomic data tend to exhibit improved prediction of drug sensitivity as compared with genomic and transcriptomic profiles. Our integrative proteogenomic analysis highlights the potential of proteome profiling to inform personalized cancer medicine. Journal: Gastroenterology. Year: 2017.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Trials and Tribulations of MicroRNA Therapeutics.. Abstract: The discovery of the link between microRNAs (miRNAs) and a myriad of human diseases, particularly various cancer types, has generated significant interest in exploring their potential as a novel class of drugs. This has led to substantial investments in interdisciplinary research fields such as biology, chemistry, and medical science for the development of miRNA-based therapies. Furthermore, the recent global success of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic has further revitalized interest in RNA-based immunotherapies, including miRNA-based approaches to cancer treatment. Consequently, RNA therapeutics have emerged as highly adaptable and modular options for cancer therapy. Moreover, advancements in RNA chemistry and delivery methods have been pivotal in shaping the landscape of RNA-based immunotherapy, including miRNA-based approaches. Consequently, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry has witnessed a resurgence of interest in incorporating RNA-based immunotherapies and miRNA therapeutics into their development programs. Despite substantial progress in preclinical research, the field of miRNA-based therapeutics remains in its early stages, with only a few progressing to clinical development, none reaching phase III clinical trials or being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and several facing termination due to toxicity issues. These setbacks highlight existing challenges that must be addressed for the broad clinical application of miRNA-based therapeutics. Key challenges include establishing miRNA sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity towards their intended targets, mitigating immunogenic reactions and off-target effects, developing enhanced methods for targeted delivery, and determining optimal dosing for therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. Additionally, the limited understanding of the precise functions of miRNAs limits their clinical utilization. Moreover, for miRNAs to be viable for cancer treatment, they must be technically and economically feasible for the widespread adoption of RNA therapies. As a result, a thorough risk evaluation of miRNA therapeutics is crucial to minimize off-target effects, prevent overdosing, and address various other issues. Nevertheless, the therapeutic potential of miRNAs for various diseases is evident, and future investigations are essential to determine their applicability in clinical settings.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Clinical and prognostic significance of m6A hypomethylation and IGF2BP3 overexpression in gastric cancer: an integrated epigenomic-transcriptomic analysis.. Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with complex pathogenesis driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. While genetic contributors to GC have been extensively studied, the functional role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation-the most abundant eukaryotic RNA modification-in gastric carcinogenesis remains insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to investigate transcriptome-wide m6A methylation dysregulation and its mechanistic implications in GC progression. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) was performed to map m6A epitranscriptomes in paired GC and adjacent normal tissues. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were conducted on 253 hypomethylated mRNAs to delineate the biological pathways associated with m6A dysregulation. The transcriptomic profiles were analyzed using RNA-seq, while a retrospective cohort analysis (n\u2009=\u200958) evaluated the correlations between IGF2BP3 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with GC. MeRIP-seq analysis demonstrated transcriptome-wide m6A hypomethylation in GC tissues, identifying 271 significantly reduced peaks (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Functional annotation revealed enrichment of hypomethylated transcripts in metabolic pathways and transcriptional dysregulation. Notably, m6A-related genes exhibited widespread activation in GC, with IGF2BP3 showing the most pronounced upregulation (106-fold increase, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Clinically, elevated IGF2BP3 expression significantly correlated with lymph node involvement (p\u2009=\u20090.016) and advanced TNM staging (p\u2009=\u20090.028). This study establishes m6A methylation dysregulation as a critical mechanism in GC pathogenesis and identifies IGF2BP3 as both a potential therapeutic target and a prognostic biomarker in GC.

Abstract: Effective cancer therapy continues to be a daunting challenge due mainly to considerable tumor cell heterogeneity, drug-resistance, and dose-limiting toxicity of therapeutics. Here we review a versatile nano-cellular (minicell) delivery vehicle that can be packaged with therapeutically effective concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs, siRNAs or shRNAs and can be targeted to tumors via minicell-surface attached bispecific antibodies. A range of minicell-based therapeutics have shown highly effective tumor stabilization/regression in the murine xenograft model and in case studies in canines with late-stage endogenous tumors. Repeat intravenous dosing shows absence of toxicity or immunogenicity in both species. The minicell-based therapeutic has potential applications in personalized cancer medicine.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with increasing global prevalence and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in the human population. Developing robust clinical prediction models and prognostic stratification strategies is crucial for developing individualized treatment plans. A range of novel forms of programmed cell death (PCD) plays a role in the pathological progression and advancement of HCC, and in-depth study of PCD is expected to further improve the prognosis of HCC patients. Sixteen patterns (apoptosis, autophagy, anoikis, lysosome-dependent cell death, immunogenic cell death, necroptosis, ferroptosis, netosis, pyroptosis, disulfidptosis, entotic cell death, cuproptosis, parthanatos, netotic cell death, alkaliptosis, and oxeiptosis) related to PCD were collected from the literatures and used for subsequent analysis. Supervised (Elastic net, Random Forest, XgBoost, and Boruta) and unsupervised (Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, NMF) clustering algorithms were applied to develop and validate a novel classifier for the individualized management of HCC patients at the transcriptomic, proteomic and single-cell levels. Multiple machine learning algorithms developed a programmed cell death index (PCDI) comprising five robust signatures (FTL, G6PD, SLC2A1, HTRA2, and DLAT) in four independent HCC cohorts, and a higher PCDI was predictive of higher pathological grades and worse prognoses. Furthermore, a higher PCDI was found to be correlated with the presence of a repressive tumor immune microenvironment (TME), as determined through an integrated examination of bulk and single-cell transcriptome data. In addition, patients with TP53 mutation had higher PCDI in comparison with TP53 WT patients. Three HCC subtypes were identified through unsupervised clustering (NMF), exhibiting distinct prognoses and significant biological processes, among the three subtypes, PCDcluster 3 was of particular interest as it contained a large proportion of patients with high risk and low metabolic activity. Construction and evaluation of the Nomogram model was drawn based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis, and highlighted the robustness of the Nomogram model in other independent HCC cohorts. Finally, to explore the prognostic value, we also validated the frequent upregulation of DLAT in a real-world cohort of human HCC specimens by qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Together, our work herein comprehensively emphasized PCD-related patterns and key regulators, such as DLAT, contributed to the evolution and prognosis of tumor foci in HCC patients, and strengthened our understanding of PCD characteristics and promoted more effective risk stratification strategies.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by expanding clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM) that produce monoclonal immunoglobulin. It is an incurable disease, accounting for about 10% of blood malignancies and the second most common hematologic malignancy. Therefore, in-depth research into the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of the disease is crucial. For the first time, we performed high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis of plasma cells in five multiple myeloma patients, and integrated it with genome resequencing and transcriptomic associated with genomic variation and gene expression. As a result, 19 specific TAD (Topologically Associating Domain) boundaries in MM samples related to the immune response and Wnt signaling pathways were identified. Additionally, Loop structures were also analyzed, revealing that promoter-enhancer-associated loops were the most prevalent. Genomic characteristics of MM patients were explored, identifying SNPs, InDels, and CNVs, with variations in the CDS region potentially affecting gene function. Transcriptome analysis showed differentially expressed genes in MM patients, mainly involved in p53 signaling and cell adhesion. Multi-omics analysis identified overlapping genes related to MM, including those involved in MHC class II protein complex assembly and antigen presentation. The study provides insights into the complex genomic and transcriptomic changes in MM plasma cells, potentially aiding in identifying therapeutic targets. Journal: Scientific reports. Year: 2025.

Hsp70s assist nascent chain protein folding and denatured proteins, as well as the import of proteins to the organelles, and solubilization of aggregated proteins. ATPase function is required for Hsp70 function. Hsp70s use ATP hydrolysis driven mechanism for substrate protein binding and release. Various Hsps are unregulated in cancers but their significance for tumor growth is poorly understood. Studies have linked Hsp70 to several types of carcinoma. Human Hsp70s allow proliferation of cancer cells and suppress apoptotic and senescence pathways. This review presents Hsp70s role for growth of transformed cells and the current state of Hsp70 as a drug target along with recent patents in humans in this particular area.

Abstract: Spatial and genomic heterogeneity of tumors are crucial factors influencing cancer progression, treatment, and survival. However, a technology for direct mapping the clones in the tumor tissue based on somatic point mutations is lacking. Here, we propose Tumoroscope, the first probabilistic model that accurately infers cancer clones and their localization in close to single-cell resolution by integrating pathological images, whole exome sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics data. In contrast to previous methods, Tumoroscope explicitly addresses the problem of deconvoluting the proportions of clones in spatial transcriptomics spots. Applied to a reference prostate cancer dataset and a newly generated breast cancer dataset, Tumoroscope reveals spatial patterns of clone colocalization and mutual exclusion in sub-areas of the tumor tissue. We further infer clone-specific gene expression levels and the most highly expressed genes for each clone. In summary, Tumoroscope enables an integrated study of the spatial, genomic, and phenotypic organization of tumors. Journal: Nature communications. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Ameloblastoma (AM) is a benign but locally infiltrative epithelial odontogenic neoplasm of the jawbones that may reach grotesque proportions and be highly recurrent if inadequately removed. The BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation has been demonstrated as a key molecular event in its development; nevertheless, there are many queries about its etiopathogenesis, which are yet to be answered. In this study, we aimed to integrate the results from whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing in AM samples to identify novel candidate genes that may be relevant to its pathogenesis. Thirteen-matched tumors were subjected to WES and RNA-seq, respectively, to detect gene mutations and gene expression profiles, along with the presence of gene fusions. Mutations were validated using Sanger sequencing, whereas transcriptome results were validated using qPCR. The results from both molecular techniques were merged in order to identify novel candidate genes that were biologically validated with immunohistochemistry. BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation was present in 62% of the analyzed cases, and each AM presented at least 2 or 3 mutations affecting cancer-driver genes. RNA-seq showed different molecular subgroups associated with an aggressive and cancer-related phenotype (epithelial-mesenchymal transition and KRAS gene sets). No gene fusions were detected among the cases. CDH11 and TGM2, novel genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in AM, were selected and validated in tissues. Both WES and RNA-seq results showed gene alterations related to proliferation, cell differentiation, and metabolic processes. These results show that AM shares many of the hallmarks of cancer secondary to the presence of oncogenic mutations or activation of oncogenic signaling pathways.

Abstract: Tumors cells reprogram their metabolism to fuel rapid growth. The ability to trace nutrient fluxes in the context of specific alterations has provided new mechanistic insight into the process of oncogenic transformation. A broad array of complementary genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional and translational mechanisms has been identified, revealing a metabolic landscape of cancer. However, cancer metabolism is not a static or uniform process, including within a single tumor. Tumor cells adapt to changing environmental conditions, profoundly shaping the enzymatic dependencies of individual cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms of adaptation, and the specific interactions between tumor genotype, oncogenic signaling, and tissue/biochemical context, remain incompletely understood. In this review, we examine dynamic aspects of how metabolic dependencies develop in cancer, shaped both by genotype and biochemical environment, and review how these interlaced processes generate targetable metabolic vulnerabilities.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: [Bone marrow relapse in high-risk pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a comparison of relapse times and initial clinical features of patients on different protocols. Children's Cancer and Leukemia Study group (CCLSG)].. Abstract: To clarify the efficacy of modern intensive chemotherapy for ALL patients with unfavorable features, we compared the time to failure and initial clinical features of children who relapsed in the bone marrow or combined sites, as documented by early CCLSG studies (H811 and H851; 1981-1987) and later studies (H874 and H/HH911; 1987-1993) concerning high-risk ALL patients. In the later studies patients outcomes with new intensive regimens employing early intensification and reinduction therapy were apparently better than those of patients in the early studies with conventional regimens. When we compared the number of relapsed patients based on duration of first remission, we found that the improved outcomes for patients in the later studies were due to a decrease in the number who relapsed 7-36 months after the start of treatment (intermediate relapse), and that the percentage of those who relapsed within the first 6 months of therapy (early relapse) was higher. Patients with high initial WBC counts tended to relapse much earlier than those with low initial WBC counts. However, in the later studies, patients with high WBC counts often relapsed after the termination of therapy (late relapse). These results suggest that the intensive chemotherapy regimens used in the later studies can prevent the development of drug resistant leukemic clones, except in extremely high-risk patients likely to relapse within the first 6 months of therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting the Dysfunctional Placenta to Improve Pregnancy Outcomes Based on Lessons Learned in Cancer.. Abstract: In recent decades, our understanding of the disrupted mechanisms that contribute to major obstetrical diseases, including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and gestational diabetes, has increased exponentially. Common to many of these obstetric diseases is placental maldevelopment and dysfunction; the placenta is a significant component of the maternal-fetal interface involved in coordinating, facilitating, and regulating maternal and fetal nutrient, oxygen and waste exchange, and hormone and cytokine production. Despite the advances in our understanding of placental development and function, there are currently no treatments for placental maldevelopment and dysfunction. However, given the transient nature and accessibility from the maternal circulation, the placenta offers a unique opportunity to develop targeted therapeutics for routine obstetric practices. Furthermore, given the similar developmental paradigms between the placenta and cancer, there is an opportunity to appropriate current knowledge from advances in targeted therapeutics in cancer treatments. In this review, we highlight the similarities between early placental development and cancer and introduce a number of targeted therapies currently being explored in cancer and pregnancy. We also propose a number of new effectors currently being targeted in cancer research that have the potential to be targeted in the development of treatments for pregnancy complications. Finally, we describe a method for targeting the placenta using nonviral polymers that are capable of delivering plasmids, small interfering RNA, and other effector nucleic acids, which could ultimately improve fetal and maternal outcomes from complicated pregnancies.

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and relapsed B-ALL is the leading cause of mortality in children with leukemia due to a lack of response to treatment. S100A8 is a low molecular weight calcium-binding intracellular protein that is expressed in certain cells, and its increased expression is seen in most tumors as well as in relapsed childhood B-ALL cases. The present study indicates the important role of S100A8 in improving viability and resistance to chemotherapy in relapsed B-ALL lymphoblasts. S100A8 levels were compared in B-ALL and relapsed B-ALL lymphoblasts that were sensitive and resistant to Vincristine, respectively. S100A8 was inhibited in the lymphoblasts of two patients by antisense locked nucleic acid (LNA) GapmeRs and the decreased expression of S100A8 was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. Then, the S100A8 antisense LNA GapmeRs-transfected cells were treated with Vincristine and the expression levels of S100A8 mRNA and S100A8 protein were re-determined. At all of these stages, cell viability and LC50 were assessed by MTT assay. The results showed that S100A8 levels in relapsed B-ALL lymphoblasts were significantly higher than B-ALL lymphoblasts. Moreover, the increase in S100A8 expression was proportionate to the increase in Vincristine resistance in these cells. The S100A8 knockdown procedure using antisense LNA GapmeRs decreased the cell viability and increased vincristine sensitivity in lymphoblasts of two patients, and it also increased the sensitivity to chemotherapy in relapsed B-ALL lymphoblasts. According to the findings of the present study, S100A8 is effective in developing lymphoblast resistance to chemotherapy, and its enhanced expression may contribute to shifting B-ALL into the relapse phase of the illness. As a result, S100A8 may be a valuable target for managing and improving relapses B-ALL. Journal: Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England). Year: 2022.

Abstract: Managing a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after relapse is arduous in low- and middle-income countries. A file review of children aged \u226415\u2009years diagnosed with relapsed ALL from 2010 to 2019 was performed. Classification of relapse followed the Berlin-Frankfurt-M\u00fcnster (BFM) scheme. The majority of patients were treated with a modified ALL-REZ-BFM protocol. Of 764 children treated for ALL in the study period, 163 (21.3%) relapsed. The median age at relapse was 101\u2009months (range: 8-297). The immunophenotype was B-ALL and T-ALL in 140 (86%) and 23 (14%) patients. The site of relapse was extramedullary, combined, and medullary in 46 (28%), 45 (28%), and 72 (44%) patients. Very early, early, and late relapses were observed in 57 (35%), 66 (40%), and 40 (25%) patients. The proportions of extramedullary and medullary sites were greater among patients with early and late relapses, respectively (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.039). Eighty-four (52%) patients were treated with palliative intent. The 2-year event-free survival (EFS) of patients treated with curative intent was 36.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3%. The 2-year EFS for very early/early and late relapses were 18.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2% and 67.6\u2009\u00b1\u200910.4% (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). The 2-year EFS did not differ between extramedullary, combined, and medullary relapses. Treatment-related mortality occurred in 14 (20%) patients. More than 50% of the patients with relapse were treated with the intent of palliation. Extramedullary relapses were more likely to be early and did not have a better outcome than medullary relapses. Children with late relapse had a fair chance of survival with chemotherapy. Journal: Pediatric hematology and oncology. Year: 2023. Authors: Korrapolu RSA, Boddu D, John R, Antonisamy N, Geevar T.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Ligand-activated EGFR/MAPK signaling but not PI3K, are key resistance mechanisms to EGFR-therapy in colorectal cancer.. Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of resistance to active therapies is crucial for developing more effective treatments. Here, we investigate resistance to anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF plus chemotherapy treatment in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from the IMblaze370 trial (NCT02788279). While anti-VEGF does not select for secondary mutations, anti-EGFR leads to simultaneous mutations in EGFR and MAPK, but not PI3K pathway genes. Notably, we observe frequent acquired mutations in the EGFR extracellular but not intracellular domain and that patients with higher baseline expression of EGFR-ligands are prone to acquire resistant mutations. This data reveals a ligand-activated EGFR/MAPK-signaling dependency in CRC. We also observe enrichment for 8q gains in anti-EGFR treated patients, potentially linked to MYC amplification, a finding further supported by baseline expression analysis. This work adds to the evidence supporting broader evaluation of EGFR and pan-KRAS inhibitor combinations in CRC patients. It also underscores the utility of EGFR ligands as anti-EGFR efficacy biomarkers and provides a rationale for developing ligand blockers to complement and/or improve conventional anti-EGFR therapies in CRC.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Metabolic Pathway Inhibition in Liver Cancer.. Abstract: Liver cancer is fundamentally physiologically different from the surrounding liver tissue. Despite multiple efforts to target the altered signaling pathways created by oncogenic mutations, not many have focused on targeting the altered metabolism that allows liver cancer to develop and grow. Still to be resolved is the question of whether the altered metabolic pathways in this cancer differ enough from the surrounding noncancerous cells to allow for the development of potent and specific compounds. Clinical studies of metabolic modulators would provide some more information with regard to the feasibility of this approach. Furthermore, as it appears that oncogenic signaling is essential to this cancer's altered metabolism, it stands to reason that targeting this altered signaling may allow the exploitation of specific metabolic vulnerabilities in combination with other drugs for enhanced efficacy. The identification of biomarkers of metabolic sensitivity will also be essential to determine whether these drugs will have the desired effect. Journal: SLAS technology. Year: 2017.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Prognostic significance of LINE-1 hypomethylation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.. Abstract: Inclusion of new biomarkers to improve a personalized treatment approach for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is urgently needed. Hypomethylation of the Long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) repetitive elements, a widely accepted surrogate of overall genomic DNA methylation content, was found to be associated with a poor prognosis in several cancers. At present, no studies have investigated the influence of LINE-1 methylation levels on OPSCC relapse. The main goal of this study was the evaluation of the prognostic value of LINE-1 methylation status in predicting early tumor relapse in locally advanced OPSCC. We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 77 patients with stage III-IVB OPSCC. Methylation of LINE-1 repetitive sequences was evaluated by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. The prognostic relevance of LINE-1 methylation was assessed by comparing patients who relapsed within 2\u00a0years from the end of treatment (cases) with those who did not (controls). Results were validated in an independent cohort of 33 patients with OPSCC. With respect to early OPSCC relapse, the mean LINE-1 methylation level was significantly lower in relapsed cases than in control group (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01). Interestingly, LINE-1 methylation was lower in relapsed cases than in controls in both HPV16-negative and HPV16-positive OPSCC patients, even if statistical significance was reached only for the former group (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.01). LINE-1 methylation levels were also significantly reduced in relapsed cases with respect to the controls in OPSCC current smokers (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.02). Consistently, in HPV16-negative current smokers, OPSCC relapse was significantly associated with decreased levels of LINE-1 methylation (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.02). Using logistic regression model, we found that patients with hypomethylated LINE-1 were associated with a 3.5 higher risk of early relapse than hypermethylated ones (OR\u2009=\u20093.51; 95% CI 1.03-12.00). Adjustment for potential confounders did not substantially change the risk magnitude. Results from the validation cohort confirmed the lower LINE-1 methylation in patients who early relapsed compared to relapse-free patients. LINE-1 hypomethylation is associated with higher risk of early relapse in stage III-IVB OPSCC. Further validation in a prospective study is needed for its application in daily clinical practice.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor, with a 5-year survival rate of 4%-7% and median survival of 12-18\u00a0months despite treatment advances. Its complex genetic profile and immunosuppressive microenvironment underscore the urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets. We conducted an integrative multi-omics study combining bioinformatics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and Mendelian Randomization (MR). Differential gene expression analysis was performed between GBM and normal tissues, followed by intersecting differentially expressed genes with expression quantitative trait loci and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) datasets. Overlapping genes were employed as instrumental variables in MR analyses with GBM as the outcome. Findings were validated using the Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization method and pQTL data from the UKB-PPP cohort. Two-step MR analyses explored the mediating effects of immune cells, cerebrospinal fluid metabolites, and plasma metabolites. Additionally, in vitro experiments and drug-gene interaction analyses validated biological functions and therapeutic potential. LGALS9 and SELL exhibited significant causal associations with elevated GBM risk. Two-step MR analyses elucidated their mechanisms: LGALS9 promotes GBM via CD3 on CD39 + resting regulatory T cells (mediating 7% of the effect), while SELL acts through cerebrospinal fluid metabolite X-22162 (mediating 16% of the effect). In vitro studies confirmed that LGALS9 and SELL enhance GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, with drug analyses and molecular docking identifying promising compounds, such as meclofenamate, targeting SELL. This pioneering study integrates multi-omics data with MR methodology in GBM research, providing robust evidence for the causal roles of LGALS9 and SELL and clarifying their mechanistic pathways. Validated through functional experiments and druggability assessments, these findings highlight actionable therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for advancing GBM treatment.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Nuclear receptors: from molecular mechanisms to therapeutics.. Abstract: Nuclear receptors are classically defined as ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate key functions in reproduction, development, and physiology. Humans have 48 nuclear receptors, which when dysregulated are often linked to diseases. Because most nuclear receptors can be selectively activated or inactivated by small molecules, they are prominent therapeutic targets. The basic understanding of this family of transcription factors was accelerated in the 1980s upon the cloning of the first hormone receptors. During the next 20 years, a deep understanding of hormone signaling was achieved that has translated to numerous clinical applications, such as the development of standard-of-care endocrine therapies for hormonally driven breast and prostate cancers. A 2004 issue of this journal reviewed progress on elucidating the structures of nuclear receptors and their mechanisms of action. In the current issue, we focus on the broad application of new knowledge in this field for therapy across diverse disease states including cancer, cardiovascular disease, various inflammatory diseases, the aging brain, and COVID-19.

Abstract: Recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma have resulted in improved response rates and overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma. These advances are largely due to thalidomide-, lenalidomide-, and bortezomib-based combinations that have improved response rates, not only in patients with untreated disease, but also in those with relapsed and/or refractory myeloma, in some cases producing response rates up to 85%. Eventually, however, nearly all patients relapse, emphasizing a continuing role for the introduction of investigational agents that overcome drug resistance. This article will review the current role for thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib-based combinations, as well as some preliminary findings for promising investigational agents currently in clinical trials for patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting long non-coding RNAs in cancer therapy using CRISPR-Cas9 technology: A novel paradigm for precision oncology.. Abstract: Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, despite recent advances in its identification and management. To improve cancer patient diagnosis and care, it is necessary to identify new biomarkers and molecular targets. In recent years, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have surfaced as important contributors to various cellular activities, with growing proof indicating their substantial role in the genesis, development, and spread of cancer. Their unique expression profiles within specific tissues and their wide-ranging functionalities make lncRNAs excellent candidates for potential therapeutic intervention in cancer management. They are implicated in multiple hallmarks of cancer, such as uncontrolled proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. This review article explores the innovative application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in targeting lncRNAs as a cancer therapeutic strategy. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been widely applied in functional genomics, gene therapy, and cancer research, offering a versatile platform for lncRNA targeting. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeting of lncRNAs can be achieved through CRISPR interference, activation or the complete knockout of lncRNA loci. Combining CRISPR-Cas9 technology with high-throughput functional genomics makes it possible to identify lncRNAs critical for the survival of specific cancer subtypes, opening the door for tailored treatments and personalised cancer therapies. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated lncRNA targeting with other cutting-edge cancer therapies, such as immunotherapy and targeted molecular therapeutics can be used to overcome the drug resistance in cancer. The synergy of lncRNA research and CRISPR-Cas9 technology presents immense potential for individualized cancer treatment, offering renewed hope in the battle against this disease.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by tumors are abundant in plasma, but their potential for interrogating the molecular features of tumors through multi-omic profiling remains widely unexplored. Genomic and transcriptomic profiling of circulating EV-DNA and EV-RNA isolated from in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo models of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) reveal a high contribution of tumor material to EV-loaded DNA/RNA, validating the findings in two cohorts of longitudinal plasma samples collected from patients during androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) or taxane-based therapy. EV-DNA genomic features recapitulate matched-patient biopsies and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and associate with clinical progression. We develop a novel approach to enable transcriptomic profiling of EV-RNA (RExCuE). We report how the transcriptome of circulating EVs is enriched for tumor-associated transcripts, captures certain patient and tumor features, and reflects on-therapy tumor adaptation changes. Altogether, we show that EV profiling enables longitudinal transcriptomic and genomic profiling of mPC in liquid biopsy. Journal: Cancer cell. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrative Multiomic Profiling of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer for Identifying Suitable Therapies.. Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease that carries the poorest prognosis of all breast cancers. Although novel TNBC therapies in development are frequently targeted toward tumors carrying a specific genomic, transcriptomic, or protein biomarker, it is poorly understood how these biomarkers are correlated. To better understand the molecular features of TNBC and their correlation with one another, we performed multimodal profiling on a cohort of 95 TNBC. Our approach involved quantifying tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes through hematoxylin and eosin staining, assessing the abundance of retinoblastoma, androgen receptor, and PDL1 proteins through IHC, and carrying out transcriptomic profiling using the NanoString BC360 platform, targeted DNA sequencing on a subset of cases, as well as evaluating associations with overall survival. Levels of RB1 mRNA and RB proteins are better correlated with markers of retinoblastoma functionality than RB1 mutational status. Luminal androgen receptor tumors clustered into two groups with transcriptomes that cluster with either basal or mesenchymal tumors. Tumors classified as PDL1-positive by the presence of immune or tumor cells showed similar biological characteristics. HER2-low TNBC showed no distinct biological phenotype when compared with HER2-zero. The majority of TNBC were classified as basal or HER2-enriched by PAM50, the latter showing significantly improved overall survival. Our study contributes new insights into biomarker utility for identifying suitable TNBC therapies and the intercorrelations between genomic, transcriptomic, protein, and cellular biomarkers. Additionally, our rich data resource can be used by other researchers to explore the interplay between DNA, RNA, and protein biomarkers in TNBC.

Abstract: BackgroundRecent technologies enabling the study of spatial biology include multiple high-dimensional spatial imaging methods that have rapidly emerged with different capabilities evaluating tissues at different resolutions for different sample formats. Platforms like Xenium (10x Genomics) and PhenoCycler-Fusion (Akoya Biosciences) enable single-cell resolution analysis of gene and protein expression in archival FFPE tissue slides. However, a key limitation is the absence of systematic methods to ensure tissue quality, marker integrity, and data reproducibility.ObjectiveWe seek to optimize the technical methods for spatial work by addressing preanalytical challenges with various tissue and tumor types, including a decalcification protocol for processing FFPE bone marrow core specimens to preserve nucleic acids for effective spatial proteomics and transcriptomics. This study characterizes a multicancer tissue microarray (TMA) and a molecular- and protein-friendly decalcification protocol that supports downstream spatial biology investigations.MethodsWe developed a multi-cancer tissue microarray (TMA) and processed bone marrow core samples using a molecular- and protein-friendly decalcification protocol. PhenoCycler high-plex immunohistochemistry (IHC) generated spatial proteomics data, analyzed with QuPath and single-cell analysis. Xenium provided spatial transcriptomics data, analyzed via Xenium Explorer and custom pipelines.ResultsResults showed that PhenoCycler and Xenium platforms applied to TMA sections of tonsil and various tumor types achieved good marker concordance. Bone marrow decalcification with our optimized protocol preserved mRNA and protein markers, allowing Xenium analysis to resolve all major cell types while maintaining tissue morphology.ConclusionsWe have shared our preanalytical verification of tissues and demonstrate that both the PhenoCycler-Fusion high-plex spatial proteomics and Xenium spatial transcriptomics platforms work well on various tumor types, including marrow core biopsies decalcified using a molecular- and protein-friendly decalcificationprotocol. We also demonstrate our laboratory's methods for systematic quality assessment of the spatial proteomic and transcriptomic data from these platforms, such that either platform can provide orthogonal confirmation for the other.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: New targets and new drugs for hepatobiliary cancers.. Abstract: The treatment of hepatobiliary cancers has advanced rapidly, with novel approaches under active development. Current drug development can be classified into two primary strategies, based on their underlying mechanisms of action. The first focuses on novel therapies targeting the immune system beyond conventional immune checkpoints like programmed death-1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4. This includes antibodies targeting new immune checkpoints and cytokines involved in tumour immune response regulation. Phase II and III clinical trials are exploring combinations of these antibodies with approved immunotherapy regimens. Cellular therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor-T cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, are also being tested in early clinical studies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biliary tract cancer (BTC). Advances in antibody engineering have also enabled the design of bispecific T-cell engagers. The second direction addresses new targets or revised approaches to traditionally undruggable targets, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene, histone deacetylase, and \u03b2-catenin. Successful in other cancers, antibody-drug conjugates expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 or nectin-4 are also being developed for BTC. Notably, the classification of these advances is somewhat arbitrary, as emerging evidence reveals new immunomodulatory roles for these therapies. Finally, these therapeutic advances suggest a change in the treatment approach for less common liver cancers, such as sarcomatoid HCC and combined HCC-cholangiocarcinoma. Recent clinical experiences and genomic data indicate potential responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Including these subtypes in clinical trials may help accelerate the development of effective treatments for these uncommon entities. Journal: Journal of hepatology. Year: 2026.

Its menace can be curbed with locally consumed spices due to their multiple bioactive phytochemicals. This review focuses on the breast cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic potentials of locally consumed spices. The most commonly consumed spices with breast cancer chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic phytochemical include pepper, onions, ginger, garlic, curry and thyme containing many biologically active metabolites ranging from vitamins, fatty acids esters, polyphenols/phenolics, sulfurcontaining compounds and anthraquinones with proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory, antitumor and anticancer properties against breast cancer/carcinogenesis. Therefore, extracts and active principles of these spices could be explored in breast cancer chemoprevention and possibly therapeutically which may provide an avenue for reducing the risk and prevalence of breast cancer.

Abstract: Even after recent advancements with monoclonal antibodies, antibody drug conjugates and immune therapies, relapsed and refractory lymphomas remain challenging to treat; and the definition and treatment approaches of hard-to-treat lymphomas (HTL) continue to evolve. Areas covered: In this review, we will address HTL encompassing diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL). DLBCL, which comprises 30-40% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous malignancy, with primary refractory or relapsed disease remaining a therapeutic challenge. Similarly, early relapse within 2\u00a0years of primary treatment in the more indolent FL is associated with inferior outcomes. Finally, PTCL are universally aggressive and carry a poor prognosis. Expert commentary: Recently, novel antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, immunotherapies and cellular therapy (CAR therapy) have shown promising results in early phase clinical trials. These agents are changing the landscape of treatment of lymphomas and will be extremely important for improving outcomes of HTL. Importantly, revising current strict eligibility criteria for clinical trial participation is needed to help these patients benefit from these novel agents. Journal: Expert review of hematology.

Abstract: Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) is a challenging disease; most GEA patients do not live for more than a year after a diagnosis of advanced disease. Development of effective targeted therapeutics for GEA patients lags behind other cancers. Progress in molecular biology has provided subclassifications of gastroesophageal cancer which may have prognostic and predictive utility and has identified novel therapeutic targets. Heterogeneity in biomarker expression has been a challenge in new drug development, leading to negative trials of targeted therapeutics in the first and second line setting. In this review, we discuss developments in understanding GEA biology, focus on putative prognostic and predictive biomarkers and examine the results of important recent clinical trials. The role of hetergeneity in GEA outcomes is reviewed and we discuss intra- and interpatient heterogenetiy in the context of emergent data on liquid biopsy and how this might complement tissue diagnosis and determine treatment in the GEA field. Finally, we examine recent results from international trials using immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA4, and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, in an effort to dissect the interaction between gastroesophageal tumour and enviroment on the immune response and we reflect on how immune checkpoint blockade may impact of treatment paradigms for GEA in future.

Abstract: Outcomes in children with teratomas collected between October 1982 and December 1995 in cooperative protocols of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (GPOH) were analyzed. Teratomas were diagnosed in 329 (42%) of 780 registered patients with germ cell tumors. The annual incidence was 0.24/100,000. Main primary sites were coccygeal (n = 132, 2.2:1 female predominance), ovary (n = 81), testis (n = 40) and brain (n = 15, 2.8:1 male predominance). Two hundred seventy cases of extracranial non-testicular teratoma were evaluated: In mature teratomas (n = 154) the observed relapse rate was 10%. Incomplete resection was the main risk factor for relapse. After complete resection, the relapse-free survival (RFS, Kaplan-Meier-estimation) was 0.96 +/- 0.01 (n = 126, observation time 18-155 months) in comparison to an RFS of 0.56 +/- 0.09 in incompletely resected teratomas grade 0 (n = 28, observation time 28-94 months) (P < 0.01). Im-mature teratomas were treated by surgery alone in 76 cases and by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy in 40 cases. The observed relapse risk was 18%. Main risk factors for relapse were incomplete tumor resection (n = 38) as well as immaturity in incompletely resected teratomas. Fifteen of 29 relapsing patients presented with malignant tissue in the recurrent tumor (mainly yolk sac tumor); in contrast, seven of 40 patients with immature teratoma relapsed despite adjuvant chemotherapy without showing malignant components (P = 0.014). Nine of 36 (25%) relapsing patients died of disease. Eleven of the 27 (41%) surviving children suffered from mutilation after repeated surgery. It is suggested that an international randomized trial for patients with incompletely resected high risk teratoma be initiated to evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on specific end-points: 1) influence on relapse rate in general; 2) reduction of the proportion of malignant relapses; 3) avoidance of mutilating surgery.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Gene-gene interactions in gastrointestinal cancer susceptibility.. Abstract: Cancer arises from complex, multi-layer interactions between diverse genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have identified multiple loci associated with tumor susceptibility. However, little is known about how germline polymorphisms interact with one another and with somatic mutations within a tumor to mediate acquisition of cancer traits. Here, we survey recent studies showing gene-gene interactions, also known as epistases, affecting genetic susceptibility in colorectal, gastric and esophageal cancers. We also catalog epistasis types and cancer hallmarks with respect to the interacting genes. A total of 22 gene variation pairs displayed all levels of statistical epistasis, including synergistic, redundant, suppressive and co-suppressive interactions. Five genes primarily involved in base excision repair formed a linear topology in the interaction network, MUTYH-OGG1-XRCC1-PARP1-MMP2, and three genes in mTOR cell-proliferation pathway formed another linear network, PRKAG2-RPS6KB1-PIK3CA. Discrete pairwise epistasis was also found in nucleotide excision repair, detoxification, proliferation, TP53, TGF-\u03b2 and other pathways. We propose that three modes of biological interaction underlie the molecular mechanisms for statistical epistasis. The direct binding, linear pathway and convergence modes can exhibit any level of statistical epistasis in susceptibility to gastrointestinal cancers, and this is likely true for other complex diseases as well. This review highlights the link between cancer hallmarks and susceptibility genes. Journal: Oncotarget. Year: 2016. Authors: Kim J, Yum S, Kang C, Kang SJ.

Abstract: <b>Introduction</b>: Targeting immune checkpoints with antibodies has significantly improved the outcome of cancer patients, but only few patients have long-term benefits from currently used PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. New approaches are needed to increase the number of patients going into long-term remission after cancer immunotherapy. Glyco-immune checkpoints are new targets for cancer immunotherapy. They are defined as immune-modulatory pathways including interactions of glycans with glycan-binding proteins or lectins. The most prominent pathway is the sialoglycan-Siglec axis and inhibitors of this axis are already successfully tested in early clinical trials.<b>Area covered</b>: Here, we summarize the current knowledge on glyco-immune checkpoints with a focus on the sialoglycan-Siglec axis. We also provide an overview on current approaches to clinically target glyco-immune checkpoints and give an outlook for the further clinical development of glyco-immune checkpoint targeting agents.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Glyco-immune checkpoints are interesting new targets to improve cancer immunotherapy. Antibodies targeting the sialoglycan-Siglec axis are already in clinical development. Other approaches with higher risk of toxicity including tumor-targeted sialidases are in late stage pre-clinical development. Despite the challenges, targeting of glyco-immune checkpoints could lead to the development of a new class of drugs providing improved anti-cancer immunity and eventually benefit cancer patients.

Abstract: High mortality rates with cancers warrant further development of earlier diagnostics and better treatment strategies. Membrane-bound erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor tyrosine kinase class A2 (EphA2) is overexpressed in breast, prostate, urinary bladder, skin, lung, ovary and brain cancers. EphA2 overexpression in cancers, its signaling mechanisms and strategies to target its deregulation. High EphA2 expression in cancer cells is correlated with a poor prognosis associated with recurrence due to enhanced metastasis. Interaction of the EphA2 receptor with its ligand (e.g., ephrinA1) triggers events that are deregulated and implicated in carcinogenesis. EphrinA1-independent oncogenic activity and ephrinA1-dependent tumor suppressor roles for EphA2 are described. Molecular interactions of EphA2 with signaling proteins are associated with the modulation of cytoskeleton dynamics, cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and metastasis. The deregulated signaling by EphA2 and its involvement in oncogenesis provide multiple avenues for the rational design of intervention approaches. EphA2 has been tested as a drug target using multiple approaches such as agonist antibodies, RNA interference, immunotherapy, virus vector-mediated gene transfer, small-molecule inhibitors and nanoparticles. With over a decade of research, encouraging results with targeting of EphA2 expression in various pre-clinical cancer models necessitate further studies.

Abstract: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10-15% of lung cancers and is characterized by early metastasis, treatment resistance and rapid progression. Treatment advancements have been stagnant for decades, with chemotherapy as the mainstay and immune checkpoint inhibitors offering only modest survival extensions. However, new insights into tumor heterogeneity and recent practice-changing observations such as the identification of targetable cell surface proteins could effectively transform SCLC therapy. In this Review, we highlight key advances in SCLC biology, therapeutic innovation and biomarker development.

Abstract: Predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM) is a strategy aimed at improving the prognosis of cancer, and programmed cell death (PCD) is increasingly recognized as a potential target in cancer therapy and prognosis. However, a PCD-based predictive model for serous ovarian carcinoma (SOC) is lacking. In the present study, we aimed to establish a cell death index (CDI)-based model using PCD-related genes. We included 1254 genes from 12 PCD patterns in our analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) were screened. Subsequently, 14 PCD-related genes were included in the PCD-gene-based CDI model. Genomics, single-cell transcriptomes, bulk transcriptomes, spatial transcriptomes, and clinical information from TCGA-OV, GSE26193, GSE63885, and GSE140082 were collected and analyzed to verify the prediction model. The CDI was recognized as an independent prognostic risk factor for patients with SOC. Patients with SOC and a high CDI had lower survival rates and poorer prognoses than those with a low CDI. Specific clinical parameters and the CDI were combined to establish a nomogram that accurately assessed patient survival. We used the PCD-genes model to observe differences between high and low CDI groups. The results showed that patients with SOC and a high CDI showed immunosuppression and hardly benefited from immunotherapy; therefore, trametinib_1372 and BMS-754807 may be potential therapeutic agents for these patients. The CDI-based model, which was established using 14 PCD-related genes, accurately predicted the tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity of patients with SOC. Thus this model may help improve the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of PPPM. Journal: Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.). Year: 2025. Authors: Ye L, Long C, Xu B, Yao X, Yu J.

Abstract: How the genomic landscape of a tumor shapes the formation of tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) and how might TLS alter the clinical outcome or response to immunotherapy had not been systematically explored. Utilizing the genomic and transcriptome data of solid tumors on TCGA, we quantified TLS based on a previous identified 12-chemokine signature and evaluated its correlation with mutation/neoantigen burden, functional mutation of oncogenes and the presence of viral infection. Clinical data was integrated to decide the prognostic significance of TLS for different cancers after surgical treatment. Publicly available data (clinical and transcriptome data) of immunotherapy clinical trials involving melanoma and lung cancer were also collected to evaluate TLS's association with therapeutic outcome. Mutation burden and predicted neoantigen counts were positively correlated with TLS scoring in multiple cancer types. Mutation in tumor suppressor genes (KEAP1, PBRM1) and genes involved in extrinsic apoptosis (CASP8), antigen-presentation (HLA-A, HLA-B), immune regulation (SMAD4) or DNA repair (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53BP1) correlated with TLS alteration in multiple tumor types, indicating the interaction between mutation landscape and TLS formation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in gastric cancer and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma were associated with increased TLS scoring. High TLS scoring predicted favorable prognosis in certain cancer after surgical treatment and improved response to immunotherapy in lung cancer and melanoma. Our findings unraveled the genomic properties associated with TLS formation in different solid tumors and highlighted the prognostic and predictive significance of TLS in surgical treatment and immunotherapy.

Abstract: It has been known for over half a century that tumors exhibit an increased demand for nutrients to fuel their rapid proliferation. Interest in targeting cancer metabolism to treat the disease has been renewed in recent years with the discovery that many cancer-related pathways have a profound effect on metabolism. Considering the recent increase in our understanding of cancer metabolism and the enzymes and pathways involved, the question arises as to whether metabolism is cancer's Achilles heel. Areas covered: This review summarizes the role of 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) in glycolysis, cell proliferation, and tumor growth, discussing PFKFB3 gene and isoenzyme regulation and the changes that occur in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Pharmacological options currently available for selective PFKFB3 inhibition are also reviewed. Expert opinion: PFKFB3 plays an important role in sustaining the development and progression of cancer and might represent an attractive target for therapeutic strategies. Nevertheless, clinical trials are needed to follow up on the promising results from preclinical studies with PFKFB3 inhibitors. Combination therapies with PFKFB3 inhibitors, chemotherapeutic drugs, or radiotherapy might improve the efficacy of cancer treatments targeting PFKFB3. Journal: Expert opinion on therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer exhibits a high degree of malignancy with a poor prognosis, lacking effective prognostic targets. Utilizing histopathological methodologies, this study endeavors to predict the expression of pathological features in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and investigate their underlying molecular mechanisms. Pathological images, transcriptomic, and clinical data from TCGA-PAAD were collected for survival analysis. Image segmentation using unsupervised machine learning was employed to extract features, perform clustering, and establish models. The prognostic value of pathological features and associated clinical risk factors were evaluated; the correlation between pathological features and molecular mechanisms, gene mutations, and immune infiltration was analyzed. By clustering 45 effective pathological features, we divided PAAD patients into two groups: cluster 1 and cluster 2. Significant associations with poor prognosis were found for cluster 2 in both the training group (n\u2009=\u2009113) and validation group (n\u2009=\u200975) (p\u2009=\u20090.006), with pathological stages II-IV identified as potential synergistic risk factors (HR\u2009=\u20092.421, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.263-4.639, p\u2009=\u20090.008). Subsequently, through multi-omics correlation analysis, we further revealed a close association between cluster 2 and the oxidative phosphorylation mechanism. Within the cluster 2 group, 28 oxidative phosphorylation genes exhibited reduced expression, CDKN2A gene mutations were upregulated, and there was significant downregulation of Tregs infiltration and related immune gene expression. The pathomic model constructed using machine learning serves as a valuable prognostic target for PAAD. The histopathological features cluster 2 are closely associated with the downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation levels and Tregs immune infiltration. Journal: Scientific reports. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Technical differences between sequencing and microarray platforms impact transcriptomic subtyping of colorectal cancer.. Abstract: Gene expression profiling has increasing relevance in the molecular screening of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated potential platform-specific effects on transcriptomic subtyping according to established frameworks by comparisons of expression profiles from RNA sequencing and exon-resolution microarrays in 126 primary microsatellite stable CRCs. There was a strong platform correspondence in global gene expression levels, albeit with systematic technical bias likely attributed to few sequencing reads covering short (<2000 nucleotides) and/or lowly expressed genes (<1 FPKM), as well as over-saturation of highly expressed genes on microarrays. Classification concordances according to both the consensus molecular subtypes and CRC intrinsic subtypes (CRIS) were also strong, but with disproportionate subtype distributions between platforms caused by frequent disagreements in adherence to sample classification thresholds. Subtypes defined largely by genes expressed at low levels, including the CRIS-D subtype and the estimated level of tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes, had a weaker correspondence in classification metrics between platforms. In conclusion, even subtle differences between platforms suggest that clinical translation of transcriptomic CRC subtyping frameworks is dependent on assay standardization, and systematic technical biases reinforce the need for careful selection of classifier genes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Murine Model of Leukemia Relapse to Induction Chemotherapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.. Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a neoplasm of immature lymphoid precursor cells and one of the most common childhood malignancies. Although cure rates in pediatric ALL approach 90%, relapse and drug resistance remain challenges. In this context, studying cancer biology in vivo is essential, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) using murine models are widely used for this purpose. However, PDXs from relapsed samples - or compared to diagnostic ones - do not fully assess the mechanisms behind relapse initiation and progression. This protocol relies on generating B-ALL PDX relapses in mice, allowing collection of leukemic cells throughout the process of acquiring drug resistance. Animals engrafted with B-ALL PDX cells are treated with a combination of four drugs commonly used in ALL therapy, representing distinct mechanisms of action: dexamethasone, vincristine, L-asparaginase, and daunorubicin. After a 4-week remission induction phase, animals are monitored for relapses during a resting period. The cycle of treatment and relapse is repeated until the time to relapse shortens, serving as a surrogate for increased in vivo drug resistance. To explore mechanisms underlying relapse and resistance, leukemic cells are collected before and after each treatment cycle for phenotypic and genetic analysis. To validate the model, different pediatric ALL samples were tested, including both good and poor responders, as assessed by the presence of blasts in peripheral blood after 7 days of corticosteroid therapy and by minimal residual disease (MRD) at days 15, 33, and 78/96. The results observed in mice were consistent with patient data, confirming the model's accuracy in mimicking the clinical response to chemotherapy. This approach enables the dynamic study of relapse and drug resistance in B-ALL, supporting mechanistic investigations and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeted Therapies for Pancreatic Cancer and Hurdles Ahead.. Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers with a median survival of 6 months after diagnosis. Intrinsic resistance to chemotherapeutics and lack of effective targeted therapies are the major factors contributing to dismal prognosis. Several important genetic alterations (i.e., mutations, deletions) have been identified to be involved in the initiation and progression of pancreatic cancer, including KRAS and inactivation of tumor suppressors, such as TP53, SMAD4 and CDKN2A. Unique tumor microenvironment with excessive stroma due to desmoplastic reaction is one of the major characteristics of PDAC, promoting tumor growth and leading to treatment failures. In addition, tumor stroma represents an important biological barrier for drug delivery and successful treatment of PDAC. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has recently emerged as a potential and targeted therapeutic approach which is now evaluated in clinical trials. However, siRNA-based therapeutics face important challenges, including rapid serum degradation, poor tumor cell uptake and cellular uptake, leading to off-target effects. Therefore, there is a great need for the development of safe and effective nanoparticles for better tumor-specific delivery of anti-cancer therapeutics. In this article, the main challenges in the treatment of pancreatic cancer and recent advancements on nano delivery systems of chemotherapeutics and gene-targeted agents, used both in preclinical and clinical trials are reviewed.

Although existing immunotherapy regimens (CAR-T, etc.) have made breakthroughs in the treatments of hematological cancer and few solid tumors such as melanoma, the therapeutic efficacy on most solid tumors is still far from being satisfactory. In recent years, the researches on tumor immunotherapy based on nanocatalytic materials are under rapid development, and significant progresses have been made. Nanocatalytic medicine has been demonstrated to be capable of overcoming the limitations of current clinicnal treatments by using toxic chemodrugs, and exhibits highly attractive advantages over traditional therapies, such as the enhanced and sustained therapeutic efficacy based on the durable catalytic activity, remarkably reduced harmful side-effects without using traditional toxic chemodrugs, and so on. Most recently, nanocatalytic medicine has been introduced in the immune-regulation for disease treatments, especially, in the immunoactivation for tumor therapies. This article presents the most recent progresses in immune-response activations by nanocatalytic medicine-initiated chemical reactions for tumor immunotherapy, and elucidates the mechanism of nanocatalytic medicines in regulating anti-tumor immunity. By reviewing the current research progress in the emerging field, this review will further highlight the great potential and broad prospects of nanocatalysis-based anti-tumor immune-therapeutics.

Abstract: The years since 2009 have seen tremendous progress in unlocking the curative potential of the immune system for the treatment of cancer. Much of that revolution in immuno-oncology has been fueled by the clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly those targeting the PD-1 axis. Unfortunately, many patients still fail to benefit from checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapies. An inability to fully activate antitumour T cells contributes in part to the failure of those therapies. Here, we review the basic biology of T cell activation, with particular emphasis on the essential role of the dendritic cell and the innate immune system in T cell activation. The current understanding of the multiple factors that govern T cell activation and how they impinge on tumour immunotherapy are also discussed. Lastly, treatment strategies to potentially overcome barriers to T cell activation and to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy are addressed. Journal: Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.). Year: 2020.

Abstract: To evaluate the suitability of the MIA PaCa-2 cell line for studying pancreatic cancer intratumor heterogeneity, we aim to further characterize the nature of MIA PaCa-2 cells' phenotypic, genomic, and transcriptomic heterogeneity. MIA PaCa-2 single-cell clones were established through flow cytometry. For the phenotypic study, we quantified the cellular morphology, proliferation rate, migration potential, and drug sensitivity of the clones. The chromosome copy number and transcriptomic profiles were quantified using SNPa and RNA-seq, respectively. Four MIA PaCa-2 clones showed distinctive phenotypes, with differences in cellular morphology, proliferation rate, migration potential, and drug sensitivity. We also observed a degree of genomic variations between these clones in form of chromosome copy number alterations and single nucleotide variations, suggesting the genomic heterogeneity of the population, and the intrinsic genomic instability of MIA PaCa-2 cells. Lastly, transcriptomic analysis of the clones also revealed gene expression profile differences between the clones, including the uniquely regulated ITGAV , which dictates the morphology of MIA PaCa-2 clones. MIA PaCa-2 is comprised of cells with distinctive phenotypes, heterogeneous genomes, and differential transcriptomic profiles, suggesting its suitability as a model to study the underlying mechanisms behind pancreatic cancer heterogeneity.

Abstract: The identification of molecular features characterizing metastatic disease is a critical area of oncology research, as metastatic foci often exhibit distinct biological behaviors compared to primary tumors. While the focus has largely been on the neoplastic cells themselves, the characterization of the associated stroma remains largely underexplored, with significant implications for understanding metastasis. By employing spatially resolved transcriptomics, we analyzed the transcriptional features of primary breast adenocarcinoma and its associated metastatic foci, on a representative set of microregions. We identified a stromal metastatic (Met) signature, which was subsequently validated across transcriptomic reference human breast cancer (BC) datasets and in spatial transcriptomics of a murine model. We discuss the potential of a stromal Met signature to pinpoint metastatic breast cancer, serving as a prognostic tool that can provide a foundation for the exploration of tumor-extrinsic molecular hallmarks of BC metastatic foci.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The interplay between angiogenesis and cervical cancer: a comprehensive review.. Abstract: Cervical cancer is still a major global health threat, specifically in countries with little access to health services. Angiogenesis in cervical cancer not only contributes to tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to therapy but also serves as a therapeutic target itself. This gives hope for the possible therapy. This review covers key molecular mechanisms in cervical cancer, including VEGF/VEGFR, HIF-1\u03b1, and PI3K/Akt pathways. It also discusses anti-angiogenic therapies like bevacizumab, small-molecule compounds, and emerging approaches such as nanoparticle-based drug delivery. Emphasis is placed on angiogenesis-related biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment selection, stressing the need for affordable therapies in low-resource settings. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to March 2025, focusing on VEGF/VEGFR signaling, anti-angiogenic therapies, and resistance mechanisms in cervical cancer. Despite promise, resistance, toxicity, and cost remain major challenges for anti-angiogenic therapy's clinical use. Combination strategies with immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted agents may be more effective. Precision medicine using multi-omics and AI offers hope for better outcomes. Future studies should evaluate drug combinations with synergistic effects and develop management strategies to universalize innovative treatments. Journal: Expert review of anticancer therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: One Step Ahead: Preventing Tumor Adaptation to Immune Therapy.. Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are cancer therapeutics that have shown remarkable success in extending lives in many cancers, including melanoma, MSI-high cancers, and other cancers. However, these therapeutics have not shown benefit for many patients with cancer, especially those with advanced cancer diagnoses. In addition, many patients develop resistance to these therapeutics and/or life-altering adverse events that can include cardiotoxicity, pneumonitis, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. Extensive efforts to improve cancer care by uncovering mechanisms of resistance to immune therapy in solid tumors have led to identification of new sources of resistance and to the development of new approaches to activate or sustain antitumor immunity. Chronic stimulation of T cells by tumors and by checkpoint inhibitors can lead to a progressive state of T-cell exhaustion. Chronic T-cell activation by the tumor microenvironment (TME) or immune therapeutics can upregulate the expression and function of alternate checkpoints, including the T-cell protein LAG-3. Persistent interferon signaling in the TME can drive epigenetic changes in cancer cells that enable tumors to counter immune activation and disrupt tumor cell elimination. In addition, immune-suppressive macrophages can flood tumors in response to signals from dying tumor cells, further preventing effective immune responses. New clinical developments and/or approvals for therapies that target alternate immune checkpoints, such as the T-cell checkpoint LAG-3; myeloid cell proteins, such as the kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma isoform; and chronic interferon signaling, such as Jak 1 inhibitors, have been approved for cancer care or shown promise in recent clinical trials.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Focal Recurrent Copy Number Alterations Characterize Disease Relapse in High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Patients with Good Clinical Prognosis: A Pilot Study.. Abstract: High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) retains high molecular heterogeneity and genomic instability, which currently limit the treatment opportunities. HGSOC patients receiving complete cytoreduction (R0) at primary surgery and platinum-based therapy may unevenly experience early disease relapse, in spite of their clinically favorable prognosis. To identify distinctive traits of the genomic landscape guiding tumor progression, we focused on the R0 patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA-OV) dataset and classified them according to their time to relapse (TTR) from surgery. We included in the study two groups of R0-TCGA patients experiencing substantially different outcome: Resistant (R; TTR \u2264 12 months; n = 11) and frankly Sensitive (fS; TTR \u2265 24 months; n = 16). We performed an integrated clinical, RNA-Sequencing, exome and somatic copy number alteration (sCNA) data analysis. No significant differences in mutational landscape were detected, although the lack of BRCA-related mutational signature characterized the R group. Focal sCNA analysis showed a higher frequency of amplification in R group and deletions in fS group respectively, involving cytobands not commonly detected by recurrent sCNA analysis. Functional analysis of focal sCNA with a concordantly altered gene expression identified in R group a gain in Notch, and interferon signaling and fatty acid metabolism. We are aware of the constraints related to the low number of OC cases analyzed. It is worth noting, however, that the sCNA identified in this exploratory analysis and characterizing Pt-resistance are novel, deserving validation in a wider cohort of patients achieving complete surgical debulking.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: In-silico analysis reveals Quinic acid as a multitargeted inhibitor against Cervical Cancer.. Abstract: The cervix is the lowermost part of the uterus that connects to the vagina, and cervical cancer is a malignant cervix tumour. One of this cancer's most important risk factors is HPV infection. In the approach to finding an effective treatment for this disease, various works have been done around genomics and drug discovery. Finding the major altered genes was one of the most significant studies completed in the field of cervical cancer by TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), and these genes are TGFBR2, MED1, ERBB3, CASP8, and HLA-A. The greatest genomic alterations were found in the PI3K/MAPK and TGF-Beta signalling pathways, suggesting that numerous therapeutic targets may come from these pathways in the future. We, therefore, conducted a combined enrichment analysis of genes gathered from various works of literature for this study. The final six key genes from the list were obtained after enrichment analysis using GO, KEGG, and Reactome methods. The six proteins against the identified genes were then subjected to a docking-based screening against a library of 6,87,843 prepared natural compounds from the ZINC15 database. The most stable compound was subsequently discovered through virtual screening to be the natural substance Quinic acid, which also had the highest binding affinity for all six proteins and a better docking score. To examine their stability, the study was extended to MM/GBSA and MD simulations on the six docked proteins, and comparative docking-based calculations led us to identify the Quinic Acid as a multitargeted compound. The overall deviation of the compound was less than 2\u2009\u00c5 for all the complexes considered best for the biological molecules, and the simulation interaction analysis reveals a huge web of interaction during the simulation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Abstract: <b>Purpose:</b> The Cancer Genome Atlas data resources represent an opportunity to explore commonalities across cancer types involving multiple molecular levels, but tumor lineage and histology can represent a barrier in moving beyond differences related to cancer type.<b>Experimental Design:</b> On the basis of gene expression data, we classified 10,224 cancers, representing 32 major types, into 10 molecular-based \"classes.\" Molecular patterns representing tissue or histologic dominant effects were first removed computationally, with the resulting classes representing emergent themes across tumor lineages.<b>Results:</b> Key differences involving mRNAs, miRNAs, proteins, and DNA methylation underscored the pan-cancer classes. One class expressing neuroendocrine and cancer-testis antigen markers represented \u223c4% of cancers surveyed. Basal-like breast cancers segregated into an exclusive class, distinct from all other cancers. Immune checkpoint pathway markers and molecular signatures of immune infiltrates were most strongly manifested within a class representing \u223c13% of cancers. Pathway-level differences involving hypoxia, NRF2-ARE, Wnt, and Notch were manifested in two additional classes enriched for mesenchymal markers and miR200 silencing.<b>Conclusions:</b> All pan-cancer molecular classes uncovered here, with the important exception of the basal-like breast cancer class, involve a wide range of cancer types and would facilitate understanding the molecular underpinnings of cancers beyond tissue-oriented domains. Numerous biological processes associated with cancer in the laboratory setting were found here to be coordinately manifested across large subsets of human cancers. The number of cancers manifesting features of neuroendocrine tumors may be much higher than previously thought, which disease is known to occur in many different tissues. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(9); 2182-93. \u00a92018 AACR</i>.

Abstract: Transcriptional reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer. However, systematic approaches to study the role of transcriptional regulators (TRs) in mediating cancer metabolic rewiring are missing. Here, we chart a genome-scale map of TR-metabolite associations in human cells using a combined computational-experimental framework for large-scale metabolic profiling of adherent cell lines. By integrating intracellular metabolic profiles of 54 cancer cell lines with transcriptomic and proteomic data, we unraveled a large space of associations between TRs and metabolic pathways. We found a global regulatory signature coordinating glucose- and one-carbon metabolism, suggesting that regulation of carbon metabolism in cancer may be more diverse and flexible than previously appreciated. Here, we demonstrate how this TR-metabolite map can serve as a resource to predict TRs potentially responsible for metabolic transformation in patient-derived tumor samples, opening new opportunities in understanding disease etiology, selecting therapeutic treatments and in designing modulators of cancer-related TRs.

Abstract: Photocatalysis can be considered as a green technology owing to its excellent potential for sustainability and fulfilling several principles of green chemistry. This process uses light radiation as the primary energy source, preventing or reducing the requirement for artificial light sources and exogenous catalytic entities. Photocatalysis has promising applications in biomedicine such as drug delivery, biosensing, tissue engineering, cancer therapeutics, etc. In targeted cancer therapeutics, photocatalysis can be employed in photodynamic therapy to form reactive oxygen species that damage cancerous cells' structure. Nanophotocatalysts can be used in targeted drug delivery, showing potential applications in nuclear-targeted drug delivery along with specific delivery of chemotherapeutics to cancer cells or tumor sites. On the other hand, in tissue engineering, nanophotocatalysts can be employed in designing scaffolds that promote cell growth and tissue regeneration. However, some important challenges pertaining to the performance of photocatalysis, large-scale production of nanophotocatalysts, optimization of reaction/synthesis conditions, long-term biosafety issues, stability, clinical translation, etc. still need further explorations.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrating alternative therapies in overcoming chemotherapy resistance in tumors.. Abstract: Chemotherapy-resistant tumors present a significant challenge in oncology, often leading to treatment failures owing to mechanisms such as genetic mutations, drug efflux, altered metabolism, and adaptations within the tumor microenvironment. These factors limit the effectiveness of treatment and contribute to tumor resistance. This review highlights the role of alternative therapies aimed at overcoming resistance mechanisms. Several alternative strategies with high efficacy rate against tumor resistance are being explored, including targeted therapies (58-64%), immunotherapy (80%), hormone therapy (22-61%), and emerging approaches such as herbal therapies (90%), probiotics (34-90%), metabolic therapies (>\u200950%), epigenetic therapies (51-89%), microbiome-based therapies (50%), gene therapy (67-80%), photodynamic therapy/hypothermia (86-99%), and nanotechnology (50-67%). Integrating these alternative strategies with conventional treatments has the potent-al to augment the therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Despite this progress, limitations in cancer therapeutics include the lack of predictive biomarkers, resistance mechanisms, and tumor heterogeneity, all of which contribute to treatment failure and relapse. To address these limitations, advancements in molecular diagnostics, as well as early detection through liquid biopsies, and the use of biomarkers to monitor resistance and guide treatment are crucial. Additionally, expanding clinical trials is essential to validate new therapies and improve patient outcomes. Journal: Molecular biology reports. Year: 2025. Authors: Alqarni SS, Khan NU.

Abstract: To date, there has been no evidence regarding the association between urinary sarcosine content and prostate cancer survival. Our main objective was to investigate whether levels of post-treatment urinary sarcosine are associated with relapse. The inclusion criteria were (in accordance with EAU 2017) as follows: histopathologically verified adenocarcinoma in prostate biopsy cores or specimens from transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or prostatectomy for benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) with retained ability to urinate. The median follow-up was 53\u00a0months. In the study, we retrospectively evaluated a cohort of 511 patients with prostate cancer with various risk factors and treatment strategies. Post-treatment sarcosine levels were elevated in 266 (52%) patients and highly elevated (\u2265200\u00a0nmol/L) in 71 (13%) patients. Urinary sarcosine content was significantly associated with number of relapses that patients experienced, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002 for sarcosine \u2265200 vs \u226430\u00a0nmol/L. Multivariate analysis revealed that sarcosine was an independent predictor of recurrent relapses (\u22652 relapses with an intermediate period of remission), HR\u00a0=\u00a03.89 (95% CI 1.29-11.7) for sarcosine >200 vs <30\u00a0nmol/L. This trend was even more pronounced in a subgroup of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, HR\u00a0=\u00a03.29 (95% CI 1.06-10.18), where (single) relapse-free survival could also be predicted by sarcosine levels, HR\u00a0=\u00a01.96 (1.05-3.66). Urinary sarcosine may become a possible predictor for patients' outcomes, because patients with elevated post-treatment sarcosine could be predicted to have recurrent relapses of the disease.

Abstract: The depletion or accumulation of metabolites in the tumour microenvironment is one of the hallmarks of cancer, but targeting cancer cell metabolism therapeutically must also take into account the impact on metabolic pathways in immune cells. As we understand more about immunometabolism, opportunities arise for synergies between agents that modulate metabolism and immunotherapy. In this Review, we discuss the pivotal role of metabolic pathways in both cancer and immune cells in shaping the tumour microenvironment. We survey major anabolic and catabolic pathways and discuss how metabolic modulators and dietary nutrients can improve the anticancer immune response and overcome drug resistance mechanisms. Agents in the clinic include inhibitors of the adenosine and tryptophan pathways, and we discuss opportunities and challenges for successful drug development in the context of immune checkpoint blockade and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Impact of Whole Lung Irradiation on Survival Outcome in Patients With Lung Relapsed Ewing Sarcoma.. Abstract: There is no standard treatment procedure for relapsed Ewing sarcoma (EwS). This retrospective analysis evaluates the survival outcome in patients with an isolated pulmonary relapse of EwS treated with whole lung irradiation (WLI) in addition to second line chemotherapy (Ctx). In our study, 136 patients with pulmonary relapsed EwS who were registered in the relapse register of the Cooperative Ewing Sarcoma Study group or the Sarcoma Relapse Registry for relapsed sarcoma of bone and soft tissues were analyzed. All patients received relapse Ctx or an additional total resection of lung metastasis. Of these patients, 88 (median age, 21\u00a0years; range, 7-52\u00a0years) achieved a second remission by the relapse treatment. Of these 88 patients, 48 patients received an additional WLI. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and 3-year overall survival (OS) were analyzed (median follow-up, 3\u00a0years; range, 7\u00a0months to 11\u00a0years and 9\u00a0months). Additional prognostic factors for survival outcomes, including the response of lung metastases to Ctx, were also estimated. The survival outcome was significantly improved after WLI when analyzing the entire group of pulmonary relapsed patients: 3-year PFS 36% (+WLI) versus 14% (-WLI) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001); 3- year OS 47% (+WLI) versus 33% (-WLI) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007). The 3-year PFS in patients with complete remission of lung relapse receiving WLI (n\u00a0=\u00a048) compared with those without WLI (n\u00a0=\u00a040), was 37% (+WLI) versus 21% (-WLI) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.18). The site of the primary tumor and the response of pulmonary lesions to Ctx were significant prognostic indicators for survival in patients treated with WLI. No severe pulmonary function disorders or lung toxicities were observed after WLI treatment in both pediatric and adult patients. The WLI does not correlate with improved OS in patients with pulmonary relapsed EwS. However, a marginal trend toward superior PFS and improved local control of pulmonary disease suggests the application of WLI in patients with EwS with isolated lung relapse and second clinical remission.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Tumor microenvironment targeted nanotherapeutics for cancer therapy and diagnosis: A review.. Abstract: Recent findings suggest that the cellular and extracellular materials surrounding the cancerous cells from an atypical tumor microenvironment (TM) play a pivotal role in the process of tumor initiation and progression. TM comprises an intricate system involving diverse cell types including endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, various inflammatory cells, dendritic cells, and cancer stem cells (CSCs). The TM-forming cells dynamically interact with the cancerous cells through various signaling mechanisms and pathways. The existence of this dynamic cellular communication is responsible for creating an environment suitable for sustaining a reasonably high cellular proliferation. Presently, researchers are showing interest to use these TM conditions to mediate effective targeting measures for cancer therapy. The use of nanotherapeutics-based combination therapy; stimuli-responsive nanotherapeutics targeting acidic pH, hypoxic environment; and nanoparticle-induced hyperthermia are some of the approaches that are under intense investigation for cancer therapy. This review discusses TM and its role in cancer progression and crosstalk understanding, opportunities, and epigenetic modifications involved therein to materialize the capability of nanotherapeutics to target cancer by availing TM. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This article presents various recent reports, proof-of-concept studies, patents, and clinical trials on the concept of tumor microenvironment for mediating the cancer-specific delivery of nanotechnology-based systems bearing anticancer drug and diagnostics. We highlight the potential of tumor microenvironment; its role in disease progression, opportunities, challenges, and allied treatment strategies for effective cancer therapy by conceptual understanding of tumor microenvironment and epigenetic modifications involved. Specifically, nanoparticle-based approaches to target various processes related to tumor microenvironment (pH responsive, hypoxic environment responsive, targeting of specific cells involved in tumor microenvironment, etc.) are dealt in detail.

Abstract: Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are a rare and heterogenous group with an increasing incidence and high mortality rate. The estimated new cases and deaths of BTC worldwide are increasing, but the incidence and mortality rates in South East Asia are the highest worldwide, representing a real public health problem in these regions. BTC has a poor prognosis with a median overall survival <12 months. Thus, an urgent unmet clinical need for BTC patients exists and must be addressed. The backbone treatment of these malignancies is chemotherapy in first- and second-line setting, but in the last decade a rich molecular landscape has been discovered, expanding conceivable treatment options. Some druggable molecular aberrations can be treated with new targeted therapies and have already demonstrated efficacy in patients with BTC, improving clinical outcomes, such as the FGFR2 or IDH1 inhibitors. Many other molecular alterations are being discovered and the treatment of BTC will change in the near future from our current clinical practice. In this review we discuss the epidemiology, molecular characteristics, present treatment approaches, review the recent therapeutic advances, and explore future directions for patients with BTC. Due to the rich molecular landscape of BTC, molecular profiling should be carried out early. Ongoing research will bring new targeted treatments and immunotherapy in the near future.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Novel targeted therapies and immunotherapy for advanced thyroid cancers.. Abstract: Thyroid cancer is a frequently encountered endocrine malignancy. Despite the favorable prognosis of this disease, 15-20% of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) cases and most anaplastic types, remain resistant to standard treatment options, including radioactive iodine (RAI). In addition, around 30% of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cases show resistance after surgery. The evolving understanding of disease-specific molecular therapeutic targets has led to the approval of two targeted therapies (Sorafenib and Lenvatinib) for RAI refractory DTC and another two drugs (Vandetanib and Cabozantinib) for MTC. These advanced therapies exert their effects by blocking the MAPK pathway, which has been widely correlated to different types of thyroid cancers. While these drugs remain reserved for thyroid cancer patients who failed all treatment options, their ability to improve patients' overall survival remain hindered by their low efficacy and other molecular factors. Among these factors is the tumor's ability to activate parallel proliferative signaling pathways other than the cascades blocked by these drugs, along with overexpression of some tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR). These facts urge the search for novel different treatment strategies for advanced thyroid cases beyond these drugs. Furthermore, the growing knowledge of the dynamic immune system interaction with tumor microenvironment has revolutionized the cancer immune therapy field. In this review, we aim to discuss the molecular escape mechanisms of thyroid tumors from these drugs. We also highlight novel therapeutic options targeting other pathways than MAPK, including PI3K pathway, ALK translocations and HER2/3 receptors and their clinical impact. We also aim to discuss the usage of targeted therapy in restoring thyroid tumor sensitivity to RAI, and finally turn to extensively discuss the role of immunotherapy as a potential alternative treatment option for advanced thyroid diseases.

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma constitute 42% to 45% of the cancers in infants, children, and adolescents: In 1985, an estimated 2025 children were newly diagnosed with these two cancers and 900 (43%) of the pediatric cancer deaths in the United States have been projected to be due to these diseases. The single most important obstacle to preventing these deaths is relapse, and prevention of relapse or salvage of the patient who has had a relapse continues to be a major therapeutic challenge. The most important initial step in the treatment of the child whose disease has relapsed is to determine, to the extent possible, the prognosis. In a child with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a relapse confers an extremely poor prognosis, regardless of site of relapse, tumor histology, or other original prognostic factors, prior therapy, or time to relapse. In the child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in relapse, the prognosis depends on multiple factors. The primary therapy is chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy with marrow grafting. Other options exist, including no therapy, or investigational therapy. The therapy selected should be predicated on the prognosis. In the child with an isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse off therapy, minimum therapy should be administered, particularly if the relapse occurred without prior cranial irradiation. In the child whose relapse is more than 6 months off therapy, conventional therapy should be considered. Also, a patient with an isolated CNS relapse on therapy after prior cranial irradiation should be given moderate therapy. Bone marrow transplantation or high-dose chemoradiotherapy with autologous marrow rescue should be reserved in children with a second or subsequent extramedullary relapse, and possibly for those with a first isolated overt testicular relapse on therapy.

Abstract: We report on the treatment of children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first relapse. The protocol focused on: (1) Intensive chemotherapy preceding allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in early bone marrow relapse; (2) Rotational chemotherapy in late relapse, without donor; (3) Postponement of cerebro-spinal irradiation in late isolated CNS relapse; and (4) Treatment in very late bone marrow relapse with chemotherapy only. From January 1999 until July 2006 all 158 Dutch pediatric patients with ALL in first relapse were recorded. Ninety-nine patients were eligible; 54 patients with early and 45 with late relapse. Eighteen patients had an isolated extra-medullary relapse; 69 patients had bone marrow involvement only. Five-years EFS rates for early and late relapses were 12% and 35%, respectively. For early relapses 5 years EFSs were 25% for patients transplanted; 0% for non-transplanted patients. For late relapses 5 years EFS was 64% for patients treated with chemotherapy only, and 16% for transplanted patients. For very late relapses EFS was 58%. Our data suggest the superiority of SCT for early relapse patients. For late relapses a better outcome is achieved with chemotherapy only using the rotational chemotherapy scheme. The most important factor for survival was interval between first CR and occurrence of the first relapse. Journal: Pediatric blood & cancer. Year: 2011.

Abstract: Over its long survival duration, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZL) routinely involves frequent relapses. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis to identify the clinical features and outcomes of relapsed or refractory MZL. From 1995 to 2008, a total of 92 patients with relapsed MZL were retrospectively analyzed. The median age of our subjects was 53.5 years (range: 23-82 years). The most common primary sites of involvement were the orbit and ocular adnexa (28.3%) followed by the lymph node and lymphatic organs (23.9%), and multiple mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) sites (13.0%). The median time to relapse from initial diagnosis was 25.5 months. Of the 53 patients with Stage I or II at diagnosis, 42 patients (79.2%) evidenced locoregional recurrence. Among these locoregional relapsed patients, 27 patients achieved CR (54.1%) or PR (18.9%). In addition to the 39 patients initially in advanced Stage III or IV, a total of 50 patients were in advanced stage at relapse. Among those patients with advanced stage at relapse, 44 patients were treated. The overall response rate was 54.5% (24 patients), with 18 CRs and 6 PRs. The median time to progression (TTP) was 34.1 months (95% CI: 11.3-56.9 months) and the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 84.3%. The majority of them was controlled well with salvage treatment, and could achieve prolonged survival. However, patients' refractory to initial therapy and advanced relapse evidenced shorter TTP and OS. Thus, we need to consider more aggressive treatment in cases of refractory MZL or advanced relapsed MZL. Journal: American journal of hematology. Year: 2009.

Abstract: We examine the complex relationship between genomic copy number variation (CNV) and gene expression, highlighting the relevance to cancer biology and other biological contexts. By tracing the history of genometranscriptome correlations, we emphasize the complexity and challenges in understanding these interactions, particularly within the heterogeneous landscape of human cancers. Recent advances in computational algorithms and high-throughput single-cell multi-omic sequencing technologies are discussed, demonstrating their potential to refine our understanding of cancer biology and their limitations. The integration of genomic and transcriptomic analyses, which offers novel insights into tumor evolution and heterogeneity as well as therapeutic strategies, is presented as a crucial approach for advancing cancer research.

Abstract: It was not until 1995 that a phase III randomized trial demonstrated that autologous stem cell transplants (ASCT) improve the progression-free and overall survival of patients with relapsed refractory diffuse aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Investigators are now focusing on improving the clinical benefit of transplants. The relative contributions made by more intensive preparative regimens, purging, concomitant immunotherapy, and the timing of transplants are under study. Also, as transplant trials shift from relapsed disease to initial therapy, anticipated benefits must be balanced against both short-term and long-term toxicities.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a highly lethal disease with increasing incidence. Due to high resistance, chemo/radiotherapy has limited success in pancreatic cancer and only marginally prolongs patient survival. Therefore, novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets are needed. In the present review, we performed a comprehensive summary of therapeutic approaches targeting the GP130/JAK/STAT3 pathway. We systematically reviewed the PubMed and Embase databases for preclinical and clinical studies, from inception to October 4, 2020, on drugs targeting the GP130/JAK/STAT3 pathway. Bias assessments and qualitative analyses were performed. Twenty-five preclinical and nine clinical trials were included in the review. All preclinical studies reported a favorable outcome in terms of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression. Futhermore, drugs targeting the GP130/JAK/STAT3 pathway were shown to be efficient chemosensitizers. However, high publication bias was assumed. In the clinical setting, bazedoxifene and itacitinib improved patient outcomes. Preclinical studies strongly suggest significant efficacy of drugs targeting GP130/JAK/STAT3 in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and that these molecules are effective chemosensitizers. Though only a few trials have shown the efficacy in a clinical setting, the STAT3 pathway remains a promising drug target for future treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and may help overcome chemotherapy resistance.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Integrated proteomics and transcriptomics analysis reveals key regulatory genes between ER-positive/PR-positive and ER-positive/PR-negative breast cancer.. Abstract: Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is characterized by the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR), it is generally associated with less aggressive clinical features and more favorable prognostic outcomes, primarily due to the effectiveness of endocrine therapy. However, the loss of PR expression has been correlated with endocrine resistance and poorer prognosis. To date, there is limited research elucidating the underlying mechanisms distinguishing ER-positive/PR-positive from ER-positive/PR-negative breast cancer. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with these two subtypes and to propose recommendations for precision therapy. Fresh tumor tissues from ER\u2009+\u2009/PR\u2009+\u2009patients (n\u2009=\u20095) and ER\u2009+\u2009/PR- patients (n\u2009=\u20095) were subjected to proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins. Transcriptomic data were obtained from the TCGA database, encompassing 937 breast cancer patients divided into three subgroups: ER\u2009+\u2009/PR\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u2009627), ER\u2009+\u2009/PR- (n\u2009=\u2009112), and ER-/PR- (n\u2009=\u2009198). Clinical characteristics and prognostic data were collected to analyze disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) across the three subtypes. Differential expression data for both transcripts and proteins were extracted, and Cox regression along with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression were applied to identify key regulatory genes. A risk scoring formula was employed to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier curves, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), immune cell infiltration analysis, and OncoPredict drug sensitivity predictions were conducted to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and clinical treatment strategies for this patient cohort. The accuracy of this model was further validated using external GEO datasets (GSE21653, GSE20685, and GSE42568). Additionally, we collected data from 97 hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our center between January 2021 and December 2023, assessing their response to chemotherapy using the Miller-Payne score. In the TCGA database, patients with ER\u2009+\u2009/PR- breast cancer exhibited poorer 5-year DSS and OS compared to those with ER\u2009+\u2009/PR\u2009+\u2009status (DSS: P\u2009=\u20090.038; OS: P\u2009=\u20090.052), which was similar to those with ER-/PR- status (DSS: P\u2009=\u20090.47; OS: P\u2009=\u20090.77). 186 differentially expressed proteins (110 up-regulated and 76 down-regulated) were identified based on proteomic analysis. After COX regression and Lasso regression, five key differential genes with prognostic and diagnostic value of ER\u2009+\u2009/PR\u2009+\u2009and ER\u2009+\u2009/PR- patients were finally included, that is HPN, FSCN1, FGD3, LRIG1, and TBC1D7. HPN, FSCN1 and FGD3 can be regarded as a tumor suppressor gene. And LRIG1, and TBC1D7 can be regarded as a risk-associated gene. Patients with high-risk scores had significantly lower survival probabilities compared to those with low-risk scores. Additionally, there were differences in functional pathway enrichment analysis (galactose_metabolism, glycolysis_gluconeogenesis, jak_stat_signaling_pathway, pentose_phosphate_pathway, et al.) and immune cell infiltration (CD8 T cell, Macrophages M1, et al.) between the high-risk and low-risk groups. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that the low-risk patients may be more sensitive to endocrine drug like fulvestrant, while high-risk patients may be more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs like docetaxel, paclitaxel, and vinorelbine. Of the 97 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our center, the proportion of patients achieving Miller-Payne (MP) score 4 and 5 was higher in ER\u2009+\u2009/PR- patients (44%) compared to ER\u2009+\u2009/PR\u2009+\u2009patients (9.8%). We confirmed that ER\u2009+\u2009/PR- breast cancer patients exhibited worse survival compared with ER\u2009+\u2009/PR\u2009+\u2009patients. Five key regulatory genes were identified and potential mechanisms and biological pathways were discovered, our prediction of drug sensitivity offers new insights for developing precise pharmacological treatment strategies for ER\u2009+\u2009/PR- breast cancer.

Abstract: Lung cancer, known for its high morbidity and mortality rates, remains one of the most critical health challenges globally. Conventional treatment options, such as chemotherapy and surgery, are often limited by high costs, significant side effects, and often yield a poor prognosis. Notably, recent research has shed light on the potential therapeutic roles of exosomes, which essentially influence lung cancer's development, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Exosomes have been revealed for their exceptional properties, including natural intercellular communication, excellent biocompatibility, minimal toxicity, prolonged blood circulation ability, and biodegradability. These unique characteristics position exosomes as highly effective drug delivery systems, nanotherapeutics, and potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in lung cancer. This review provides a comprehensive review of the physiological and pathological roles of exosomes in lung cancer, emphasizing their potential as innovative diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutics, and delivery platforms. By harnessing their unique properties, exosomes are poised to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, offering a promising avenue for more personalized and effective therapies.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Breast phyllodes tumour with epithelioid feature predisposes to malignant transformation.. Abstract: Phyllodes tumours (PTs) are relatively common fibroepithelial tumours comprising epithelial and stromal component. Usually, PTs show a spindle cell morphology with a fibroblast phenotype, while some tumour cells exhibit epithelioid morphological features and sarcomatoid transformation. However, the molecular characteristics of this morphology subset remain unclear. This study aimed to summarise the clinicopathological, morphological and molecular characteristics of seven cases of PT with epithelioid features. Morphological and clinicopathological characteristics were observed and retrieved. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and electron microscope were performed on seven cases of epithelioid PT to explore immunophenotypic and ultrastructural characteristics. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were conducted to compare differentially expressed genes and proteins between epithelioid PT and classical PT. Patients with epithelioid PT exhibit a high recurrence rate (42.8%). Morphologically, in addition to having epithelioid cytological features, neoplastic stromal cells exhibit moderate to marked atypia and often exhibit sarcomatoid transformation, similar to the characteristics of borderline PT. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses demonstrated that epithelioid PTs are distinct from classical PTs in gene expression and protein abundance levels. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that among all differentially expressed proteins, epithelioid PT showed abnormal p16/retinoblastoma expression patterns, similar to those of malignant PT. Epithelioid PT has unique morphological characteristics, biological behaviour and protein expression profile, which meets the diagnostic criteria of borderline PT and is prone to sarcomatoid transformation. It may be a special morphological subgroup of borderline PT and has partial characteristics of malignant PT, which should be taken seriously in pathological diagnosis and clinical management.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular tumour boards - current and future considerations for precision oncology.. Abstract: Over the past 15 years, rapid progress has been made in developmental therapeutics, especially regarding the use of matched targeted therapies against specific oncogenic molecular alterations across cancer types. Molecular tumour boards (MTBs) are panels of expert physicians, scientists, health-care providers and patient advocates who review and interpret molecular-profiling results for individual patients with cancer and match each patient to available therapies, which can include investigational drugs. Interpretation of the molecular alterations found in each patient is a complicated task that requires an understanding of their contextual functional effects and their correlations with sensitivity or resistance to specific treatments. The criteria for determining the actionability of molecular alterations and selecting matched treatments are constantly evolving. Therefore, MTBs have an increasingly necessary role in optimizing the allocation of biomarker-directed therapies and the implementation of precision oncology. Ultimately, increased MTB availability, accessibility and performance are likely to improve patient care. The challenges faced by MTBs are increasing, owing to the plethora of identifiable molecular alterations and immune markers in tumours of individual patients and their evolving clinical significance as more and more data on patient outcomes and results from clinical trials become available. Beyond next-generation sequencing, broader biomarker analyses can provide useful information. However, greater funding, resources and expertise are needed to ensure the sustainability of MTBs and expand their outreach to underserved populations. Harmonization between practice and policy will be required to optimally implement precision oncology. Herein, we discuss the evolving role of MTBs and current and future considerations for their use in precision oncology. Journal: Nature reviews. Clinical oncology. Year: 2023.

Abstract: Breast carcinoma represents a biologically heterogeneous group of malignancies with diverse clinical behaviors, highlighting the need for robust molecular markers to support accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making. Histopathologic evaluation and assessment of established biomarkers, including estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, remain central to clinical management, yet these biomarkers do not fully capture the disease complexity. Advances in genomics have enabled identification of intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, improving risk stratification and personalization of therapy. New molecular technologies such as next-generation sequencing and liquid biopsy approaches have uncovered actionable genomic alterations and allow for real-time monitoring. Emerging biomarkers such as cyclin E overexpression, BRCA1/2 mutations, and mismatch repair deficiency provide additional prognostic and predictive value, especially in guiding targeted therapies. The tumor microenvironment, including immune cell infiltration and stromal composition, has also gained recognition for its role in modulating tumor progression and therapeutic response. Liquid biopsy tools, including analysis of circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and exosomes, offer promising non-invasive methods for disease surveillance and early detection of resistance. High-throughput techniques such as spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immunofluorescence are accelerating biomarker discovery with potential clinical application. Despite these advances, challenges remain in standardization, reproducibility, and clinical validation. This review summarizes current and emerging breast cancer biomarkers, emphasizing their role in advancing precision oncology. Continued translational research and methodological refinement are essential for successful integration of new biomarkers into clinical practice and for improving patient outcomes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Computer-Aided Ligand Discovery for Estrogen Receptor Alpha.. Abstract: Breast cancer (BCa) is one of the most predominantly diagnosed cancers in women. Notably, 70% of BCa diagnoses are Estrogen Receptor \u03b1 positive (ER\u03b1+) making it a critical therapeutic target. With that, the two subtypes of ER, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, have contrasting effects on BCa cells. While ER\u03b1 promotes cancerous activities, ER\u03b2 isoform exhibits inhibitory effects on the same. ER-directed small molecule drug discovery for BCa has provided the FDA approved drugs tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene and fulvestrant that all bind to the estrogen binding site of the receptor. These ER-directed inhibitors are non-selective in nature and may eventually induce resistance in BCa cells as well as increase the risk of endometrial cancer development. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs with alternative ER\u03b1 targeting mechanisms that can overcome the limitations of conventional anti-ER\u03b1 therapies. Several functional sites on ER\u03b1, such as Activation Function-2 (AF2), DNA binding domain (DBD), and F-domain, have been recently considered as potential targets in the context of drug research and discovery. In this review, we summarize methods of computer-aided drug design (CADD) that have been employed to analyze and explore potential targetable sites on ER\u03b1, discuss recent advancement of ER\u03b1 inhibitor development, and highlight the potential opportunities and challenges of future ER\u03b1-directed drug discovery.

Abstract: Solid tumor pathology, characterized by abnormalities in the tumor microenvironment (TME), challenges therapeutic effectiveness. Mechanical factors, including increased tumor stiffness and accumulation of intratumoral forces, can determine the success of cancer treatments, defining the tumor's \"mechanopathology\" profile. These abnormalities cause extensive vascular compression, leading to hypoperfusion and hypoxia. Hypoperfusion hinders drug delivery, while hypoxia creates an unfavorable TME, promoting tumor progression through immunosuppression, heightened metastatic potential, drug resistance, and chaotic angiogenesis. Strategies targeting TME mechanopathology, such as vascular and stroma normalization, hold promise in enhancing cancer therapies with some already advancing to the clinic. Normalization can be achieved using anti-angiogenic agents, mechanotherapeutics, immune checkpoint inhibitors, engineered bacterial therapeutics, metronomic nanomedicine, and ultrasound sonopermeation. Here, we review the methods developed to rectify tumor mechanopathology, which have even led to cures in preclinical models, and discuss their bench-to-bedside translation, including the derivation of biomarkers from tumor mechanopathology for personalized therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Capturing Unicorns: Targeting Cancers With <i>TP53</i> Mutations, <i>RAS</i> Alterations Beyond G12C, and <i>MTAP</i> Loss-No Target Is Out of the Realm of Possibility.. Abstract: In cancer genomics, there is the realization that some very frequently mutated genes like <i>TP53</i> or <i>KRAS</i> are extremely hard to approach from a therapeutic perspective. In the realm of cancer treatment, the development of agents capable of transforming these alterations into actionable targets would be like capturing unicorns. These unicorns of oncology-drugs targeting undruggable targets that span various cancer types-offer an exciting opportunity for the development of histology-agnostic therapies. Among these, recent developments in targeting <i>TP53</i> mutations, <i>KRAS</i> alterations, and <i>MTAP</i> loss mark pivotal advancements for innovative treatment strategies. <i>TP53</i> mutations, which occur in nearly every cancer type, are central to tumorigenesis and contribute to resistance against conventional therapies. <i>KRAS</i> mutations, especially in cancers like pancreatic and lung cancers, are notoriously difficult to target but are now yielding promising therapeutic avenues. Similarly, <i>MTAP</i> is frequently deleted in cancers such as lung, pancreatic, and mesothelioma and plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and epigenetics, making its loss a significant vulnerability in tumor cells. Recent developments in drug discovery provide a broad foundation for the clinical testing of drugs that target common mechanisms across diverse tumor types, offering hope for a more universal approach to cancer treatment.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting and exploiting macropinocytosis in cancer therapy.. Abstract: Macropinocytosis, a cellular process often hyperactivated in cancers with KRAS mutations or PTEN deficiencies, plays a crucial role in tumor survival and therapy. While inhibiting this pathway has been explored as a strategy to deprive cancer cells of essential nutrients, recent advances in nanotechnology offer an innovative approach that exploits macropinocytosis for selective drug delivery. Engineered therapeutics, including nanoparticles, peptide-drug conjugates, and macromolecule-bound drugs, leverage the elevated macropinocytic activity in tumor cells to enhance drug uptake, thereby improving treatment efficacy while minimizing off-target effects. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the molecular mechanisms regulating macropinocytosis in cancer, addressing both intrinsic factors, such as oncogenic mutations, and extrinsic influences from the tumor microenvironment. We explore both inhibition strategies and therapeutic exploitation of macropinocytosis in cancer therapy, focusing specifically on the latest innovations in engineered therapeutics designed to enhance selective drug delivery. By addressing the challenges of translating macropinocytosis-targeting therapies into clinical practice, including tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance, this review highlights how modulating macropinocytosis presents new opportunities for more effective and personalized cancer treatments.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Immunotherapy for cancer treatment during pregnancy.. Abstract: Immunotherapy has greatly improved outcomes for subgroups of patients with cancer. As indications keep expanding, there is an unmet need to gain a better understanding of the effect of these therapies on pregnancy and fertility. During pregnancy, substantial adaptations occur in the maternal immune system to maintain protection against pathogens while avoiding detrimental reactions to the semi-allogeneic fetus. The pathways involved in the establishment of this fetomaternal tolerance can be hijacked by cancers. Immunotherapies that target these inhibitory pathways, or that directly interact with the regulatory immune cells involved in tolerance mechanisms, might therefore result in complications during pregnancy. Similarly, by activating the patient's immune system with immunotherapy, a broad range of immune-related adverse events can occur that could negatively affect the fetus or impede a future desired pregnancy. This Review summarises preclinical and clinical data related to the use of immunotherapy during pregnancy, including all approved immune checkpoint inhibitors, recombinant cytokines, cell therapies, vaccines, and immunomodulatory drugs.

The variety of RNA molecules that can inhibit the expression of any mRNA using, for example, RNA interference (RNAi) strategies, or increase the expression of a given protein using modified mRNA together with new gene editing strategies open new avenues for manipulating the fate of diseased cells while leaving healthy cells untouched. In addition, these therapeutic RNA molecules can maximize the treatment of diseases and minimize its adverse effects. Yet, the promise of RNA therapeutics is hindered by the lack of efficient delivery strategies to selectively target these molecules into specific cells. Herein, we will focus on the challenges and opportunities of the delivery of therapeutic RNAi molecules into cancer cells with special emphasis on solid tumors. Solid tumors represent more than 80 percent of cancers and some are very challenging to treat, not merely due to physiological barriers but also since the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex milieu of accessory cells besides the cancerous cells. In this review, we will highlight various limiting factors to successful delivery, current clinical achievements and future outlook focusing on RNAi therapeutics to the TME.

Abstract: Recent large-scale multi-omics studies have characterized the heterogeneity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but inconsistent clinical management has hindered the identification of prognostic markers and patient stratification. Here, we conducted genomic and transcriptomic profiling of 203 patients from the ECTOP-2002 study with full clinical information. Mutation in the mucin family, as well as APOBEC signature, were associated with poor prognosis. In contrast, activation of the epithelial-keratinization (EpK) pathway was strongly linked to favorable prognosis and lower post-chemotherapy recurrence rates. Independent validation supported S100A8\u2009+\u2009S100A9 complex as a key marker of EpK pathway. Furthermore, we established a prognostic stratification system, FU-ESCC subtyping, which defines three subtypes with distinct molecular and clinical features. The EpK-activated subtype retained characteristics of healthy squamous epithelial cells, showed high expression of the S100A8\u2009+\u2009S100A9 complex, and was associated with favorable prognosis. The cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-enriched subtype showed elevated FAP and Vimentin expression, abundant CAFs, high proliferative activity, and poor prognosis. The immune-desert subtype was characterized by low immune infiltration, suppressed immune signaling, and similarly poor prognosis. Our study provides a valuable resource and insights to better understand ESCC in the era of precision medicine and targeted therapies. Journal: Signal transduction and targeted therapy. Year: 2025.

Abstract: Prognostic models for primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) resistant to or relapsing after initial therapy with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) have not been well-established. A refined categorization of normalized lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (the ratio to the upper limit of normal) was recently shown to predict prognosis of newly-diagnosed patients with DLBCL better than mere dichotomization of LDH into 'normal' and 'abnormal' groups. To define the prognostic impact of the LDH ratio and various other factors in order to develop a new prognostic model system, we retrospectively analyzed 31 patients with refractory/relapsed DLBCL initially treated with R-CHOP at our hospital from 2002 to 2013. Median age at the start of salvage therapy was 63 years. Median time from diagnosis to relapse was 349 days. In univariate analysis, LDH, short time from initial diagnosis to relapse (TTR), and low absolute lymphocyte count at relapse (ALC-R) were significant factors for reduced progression-free survival, and the LDH ratio was a more powerful factor than LDH abnormality. Furthermore, an LDH ratio >3 and short TTR were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. We built a new prognostic scoring system, namely the time, LDH, and lymphocyte count (TLL), based on TTR, LDH ratio, and ALC-R, which is able to separate patients into three risk groups with 2-year PFS of 100%, 68.6% and 4.8%, respectively, and which also predicts outcome of autologous stem cell transplantation at the start of salvage therapy. The present study indicates that the LDH ratio is an important predictor of survival for patients with refractory/relapsed DLBCL and proposes the TLL index as a useful prognostic tool.

Abstract: Chemotherapeutics continue to play a central role in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers. Conventional chemotherapy involving bolus intravenous doses results in severe side effects - in some cases life threatening - delayed toxicity and compromised quality-of-life. Attempts to deliver small drug molecules using liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, lipid nanoparticles, etc. have produced limited nanoformulations for clinical use, presumably due to a lack of biocompatibility of the material, costs, toxicity, scalability, and/or lack of effective administration. Naturally occurring small extracellular vesicles, or exosomes, may offer a solution and a viable system for delivering cancer therapeutics. Combined with their inherent trafficking ability and versatility of cargo capacity, exosomes can be engineered to specifically target cancerous cells, thereby minimizing off-target effects, and increasing the efficacy of cancer therapeutics. Exosomal formulations have mitigated the toxic effects of several drugs in murine cancer models. In this article, we review studies related to exosomal delivery of both small molecules and biologics, including siRNA to inhibit specific gene expression, in the pursuit of effective cancer therapeutics. We focus primarily on bovine milk and colostrum exosomes as the cancer therapeutic delivery vehicles based on their high abundance, cost effectiveness, scalability, high drug loading, functionalization of exosomes for targeted delivery, and lack of toxicity. While bovine milk exosomes may provide a new platform for drug delivery, extensive comparison to other nanoformulations and evaluation of long-term toxicity will be required to fully realize its potential.

Abstract: Development of resistance against first line drug therapy including cisplatin and paclitaxel in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) presents a major challenge. Identifying drug candidates breaking resistance, ideally combined with predictive biomarkers allowing precision use are needed for prolonging progression free survival of ovarian cancer patients. Modeling of molecular processes driving drug resistance in tumor tissue further combined with mechanism of action of drugs provides a strategy for identification of candidate drugs and associated predictive biomarkers. Consolidation of transcriptomics profiles and biomedical literature mining results provides 1242 proteins linked with ovarian cancer drug resistance. Integrating this set on a protein interaction network followed by graph segmentation results in a molecular process model representation of drug resistant HGSOC embedding 409 proteins in 24 molecular processes. Utilizing independent transcriptomics profiles with follow-up data on progression free survival allows deriving molecular biomarker-based classifiers for predicting recurrence under first line therapy. Biomarkers of specific relevance are identified in a molecular process encapsulating TGF-beta, mTOR, Jak-STAT and Neurotrophin signaling. Mechanism of action molecular model representations of cisplatin and paclitaxel embed the very same signaling components, and specifically proteins afflicted with the activation status of the mTOR pathway become evident, including VEGFA. Analyzing mechanism of action interference of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus shows specific impact on the drug resistance signature imposed by cisplatin and paclitaxel, further holding evidence for a synthetic lethal interaction to paclitaxel mechanism of action involving cyclin D1. Stratifying drug resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer via VEGFA, and specifically treating with mTOR inhibitors in case of activation of the pathway may allow adding precision for overcoming resistance to first line therapy.

For those who relapse, outcomes have remained static at\u2009~50% making relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia one of the leading causes of death in childhood cancers. Those relapsing within 18 mo in the bone marrow have a particularly dismal outcome. The mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy, local radiotherapy with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Improved biological understanding of mechanisms of relapse and drug resistance, use of innovative strategies to identify the most effective and least toxic treatment regimens and global partnerships are needed to improve outcomes in these patients. Over the last decade, new therapeutic options and strategies have been developed for relapsed ALL including immunotherapies and cellular therapies. It is imperative to understand how and when to use these newer approaches in relapsed ALL. Increasingly, integrated precision oncology strategies are being\u00a0used to individualize treatment of patients with relapsed ALL, especially in patients with poor response disease.

Abstract: Increased rates of ribosome biogenesis have been recognized as hallmarks of many cancers and are associated with poor prognosis. Using a CRISPR synergistic activation mediator (SAM) system library targeting 89 ribosomal proteins (RPs) to screen for the most oncogenic functional RPs in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we found that high expression of RPS15 correlates with malignant phenotype and poor prognosis of ESCC. Gain and loss of function models revealed that RPS15 promotes ESCC cell metastasis and proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that RPS15 interacts with the K homology domain of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1), which recognizes and directly binds the 3'-UTR of MKK6 and MAPK14 mRNA in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner, and promotes translation of core p38 MAPK pathway proteins. By combining targeted drug virtual screening and functional assays, we found that folic acid showed a therapeutic effect on ESCC by targeting RPS15, which was augmented by the combination with cisplatin. Inhibition of RPS15 by folic acid, IGF2BP1 ablation, or SB203580 treatment were able to suppress ESCC metastasis and proliferation via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Thus, RPS15 promotes ESCC progression via the p38 MAPK pathway and RPS15 inhibitors may serve as potential anti-ESCC drugs. Journal: Signal transduction and targeted therapy. Year: 2023.

Abstract: Highly expressed STOML2 has been reported in a variety of cancers, yet few have detailed its function and regulatory mechanism. This research aims to reveal regulatory mechanism of STOML2 and to provide evidence for clinical therapeutics, via exploration of its role in colorectal cancer, and identification of its interacting protein. Expression level of STOML2 in normal colon and CRC tissue from biobank in Nanfang Hospital was detected by pathologic methods. The malignant proliferation of CRC induced by STOML2 was validated via gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments, with novel techniques applied, such as organoid culture, orthotopic model and endoscopy monitoring. Yeast two-hybrid assay screened interacting proteins of STOML2, followed by bioinformatics analysis to predict biological function and signaling pathway of candidate proteins. Target protein with most functional similarity to STOML2 was validated with co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence were conducted to co-localize STOML2 and PHB. Pathway regulated by STOML2 was detected with immunoblotting, and subsequent experimental therapy was conducted with RAF inhibitor Sorafenib. STOML2 was significantly overexpressed in colorectal cancer and its elevation was associated with unfavorable prognosis. Knockdown of STOML2 suppressed proliferation of colorectal cancer, thus attenuated subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor growth, while overexpressed STOML2 promoted proliferation in cell lines and organoids. A list of 13 interacting proteins was screened out by yeast two-hybrid assay. DTYMK and PHB were identified to be most similar to STOML2 according to bioinformatics in terms of biological process and signaling pathways; however, co-immunoprecipitation confirmed interaction between STOML2 and PHB, rather than DTYMK, despite its highest rank in previous analysis. Co-localization between STOML2 and PHB was confirmed in cell lines and tissue level. Furthermore, knockdown of STOML2 downregulated phosphorylation of RAF1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 on the MAPK signaling pathway, indicating common pathway activated by STOML2 and PHB in colorectal cancer proliferation. This study demonstrated that in colorectal cancer, STOML2 expression is elevated and interacts with PHB through activating MAPK signaling pathway, to promote proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, combination of screening assay and bioinformatics marks great significance in methodology to explore regulatory mechanism of protein of interest.

Abstract: The majority of advanced breast cancers have genetic alterations that are potentially targetable with drugs. Through initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), data can be mined to provide context for next-generation sequencing (NGS) results in the landscape of advanced breast cancer. Therapies for targets other than estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and HER2, such as cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, were recently approved based on efficacy in patient subpopulations, but no predictive biomarkers have been found, leaving clinicians to continue a trial-and-error approach with each patient. Next-generation sequencing identifies potentially actionable alterations in genes thought to be drivers in the cancerous process including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT, fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), and mutant HER2. Epigenetically directed and immunologic therapies have also shown promise for the treatment of breast cancer via histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1 and 3, programmed T cell death 1 (PD-1), and programmed T cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Identifying biomarkers to predict primary resistance in breast cancer will ultimately affect clinical decisions regarding adjuvant therapy in the first-line setting. However, the bulk of medical decision-making is currently made in the secondary resistance setting. Herein, we review the clinical potential of PI3K, AKT, FGFRs, mutant HER2, HDAC1/3, PD-1, and PD-L1 as therapeutic targets in breast cancer, focusing on the rationale for therapeutic development and the status of clinical testing.

Abstract: Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is an ultra-rare malignancy with a high risk of recurrence after surgery. Tumour-directed systemic treatments for PC are not established. We used whole-genome and RNA sequencing in four patients with advanced PC to identify molecular alterations that could guide clinical management. In two cases, the genomic and transcriptomic profiles provided targets for experimental therapies that resulted in biochemical response and prolonged disease stabilization: (a) immune checkpoint inhibition with pembrolizumab based on high tumour mutational burden and a single-base substitution signature associated with APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) overactivation; (b) multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition with lenvatinib due to overexpression of FGFR1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1) and RET (Ret Proto-Oncogene) and, (c)\u00a0later in the course of the disease, PARP (Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase) inhibition with olaparib prompted by signs of defective homologous recombination DNA repair. In addition, our data provided new insights into the molecular landscape of PC with respect to the genome-wide footprints of specific mutational processes and pathogenic germline alterations. These data underscore the potential of comprehensive molecular analyses to improve care for patients with ultra-rare cancers based on insight into disease biology. Journal: Molecular oncology.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Targeting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase signaling in the development of effective cancer therapy.. Abstract: Pyruvate is irreversibly decarboxylated to acetyl coenzyme A by mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Decarboxylation of pyruvate is considered a crucial step in cell metabolism and energetics. The cancer cells prefer aerobic glycolysis rather than mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate. This attribute of cancer cells allows them to sustain under indefinite proliferation and growth. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) play critical roles in many diseases because they regulate PDC activity. Recent findings suggest an altered metabolism of cancer cells is associated with impaired mitochondrial function due to PDC inhibition. PDKs inhibit the PDC activity via phosphorylation of the E1a subunit and subsequently cause a glycolytic shift. Thus, inhibition of PDK is an attractive strategy in anticancer therapy. This review highlights that PDC/PDK axis could be implicated in cancer's therapeutic management by developing potential small-molecule PDK inhibitors. In recent years, a dramatic increase in the targeting of the PDC/PDK axis for cancer treatment gained an attention from the scientific community. We further discuss breakthrough findings in the PDC-PDK axis. In addition, structural features, functional significance, mechanism of activation, involvement in various human pathologies, and expression of different forms of PDKs (PDK1-4) in different types of cancers are discussed in detail. We further emphasized the gene expression profiling of PDKs in cancer patients to prognosis and therapeutic manifestations. Additionally, inhibition of the PDK/PDC axis by small molecule inhibitors and natural compounds at different clinical evaluation stages has also been discussed comprehensively.

Abstract: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a cytoplasmic transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation and immune responses. Aberrant STAT3 activation triggers tumor progression through oncogenic gene expression in numerous human cancers, leading to promote tumor malignancy. On the contrary, STAT3 activation in immune cells cause elevation of immunosuppressive factors. Accumulating evidence suggests that the tumor microenvironment closely interacts with the STAT3 signaling pathway. So, targeting STAT3 may improve tumor progression, and anti-cancer immune response.

Abstract: Several targeted agents demonstrated efficacy in early clinical trials for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, but in many cases, phase-III trials and/or approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are lacking. The primary focus of this study was to assess the regulatory processes associated with use and reimbursement of off-label treatment in precision oncology and to evaluate the benefit of targeted therapy in a real-world population in Germany. Our cohort comprises 137 patients with GI cancers and is biased towards cancer entities with a high frequency of known targetable alterations, such as cholangiocarcinoma. Genetic testing was used to identify molecular targets, and therapy response was evaluated based on CT scans. A molecular target for precision oncology was identified in 53 patients and 43 requests for cost coverage were submitted to health insurance companies. 60% of the requests received approval after initial application and another 7% after appeal. Half of the rejected requests were denied despite ESCAT IA level evidence. The median time between initiation of molecular testing and start of therapy was 75\u00a0days. 35 patients received matched targeted therapies (n\u2009=\u200928) or, in the case of MSI, immunotherapy (IO) (n\u2009=\u20097). We observed a trend in favor of molecular therapy when compared to the immediate prior treatment. Relevant treatment options were identified by molecular testing in a significant subset of patients. When targeted therapies that lack EMA approval are considered, treatment initiation may be delayed by the duration of the molecular analysis and the regulatory processes.

While advances in precision oncology have contributed to improvements in patient outcomes and provided a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms that drive the disease, historically, research and patients' allocation to treatment have heavily relied on single-omic approaches, analyzing individual molecular dimensions such as genomics, transcriptomics, or proteomics. While these have provided deep insights into breast cancer biology, they often fail to offer a complete understanding of the disease's complex molecular landscape. In this review, the authors explore the recent advancements in multi-omic research in the realm of breast cancer and use clinical data to show how multi-omic integration can offer a more holistic understanding of the molecular alterations and their functional consequences underlying breast cancer. The overall developments in multi-omic research and AI are expected to complement precision diagnostics through potentially refining prognostic models, and treatment selection. Overcoming challenges such as cost, data complexity, and lack of standardization is crucial for unlocking the full potential of multi-omics and AI in breast cancer patient care to enable the advancement of personalized treatments and improve patient outcomes.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic profiling of pulmonary nodules in synchronous multiple primary lung cancer.. Abstract: Synchronous multiple primary lung cancer (sMPLC) exhibits distinct histopathological characteristics among pulmonary nodules. However, a comprehensive understanding of the somatic mutation landscape and transcriptome heterogeneity is lacking. Therefore, our study aims to meticulously investigate genomic distinctions among multiple pulmonary nodules within individual patients. We performed targeted DNA sequencing on tumor specimens and conducted bulk RNA transcriptome analysis on 53 multiple nodules originating from 26 lung cancer patients. The multiple nodules from the same patient was determined as major nodule and minor nodule. Additionally, the tumor tissues underwent histopathological evaluation through H&E staining, complemented by a comprehensive series of immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses to detect protein expression. The detected protein markers encompassed PD-L1, Ki67, and others. For the 53 nodule samples from 26 MPLCs patients, EGFR was the mostly mutated genes, and the TP53 mutation frequency was notably different between major and minor nodules. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between major and minor nodules revealed the significantly active cell cycle and p53 pathways in the major nodules. Additionally, both major and minor nodules demonstrated mostly similar immune microenvironment and PD-L1 protein expression, and a significantly higher expression of Ki67. A noteworthy suppression was observed in the immune microenvironment in nodules, revealed by the expression of macrophage, neutrophils, and NK cells. Furthermore, minor nodules exhibited a modestly elevated expression of macrophages compared to major nodules. Additionally, among the significantly up-regulated cell cycle-related genes in the major nodules when compared with minor nodules, CCNE1 mRNA expression demonstrated significant correlation with poor prognosis in the lung cancer. Furthermore, the MYC inhibitor demonstrated more sensitivity for the major nodules than minor nodules. This study validated molecular distinctions between samples from major and minor nodules in patients with sMPLC at both genomic and transcriptomic levels. The major nodules exhibited heightened activity in tumor cell proliferation pathways and demonstrated malignancy-related biological characteristics, which correlated with pathological assessment results.

Abstract: Early recurrence remains a major challenge in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet its molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we applied an integrative multi-omics strategy at single-cell resolution to explore potential drivers of early HCC recurrence (recurrence time <\u20092\u2009years) and to develop a predictive framework. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, transcriptomics, and clinical feature analysis, we identified 14 relapse-associated proteins, including CD274, B2M, MYC, and CASP3, as candidate risk factors. Transcriptomic profiling suggested the enrichment of pathways such as MYC-TARGETS-V2 and INTERFERON-GAMMA-RESPONSE. Single-cell analysis indicated reduced immune cell infiltration in recurrent tumors, with myeloid cells (particularly cDC2 and macrophages) showing B2M-associated reprogramming characterized by HLA downregulation and altered GAS6/PROS1 signaling, consistent with tumor-associated macrophage-like phenotypes. A LASSO regression model based on cDC2 and macrophage signature genes demonstrated moderate predictive performance in both the training and validation cohorts (AUC >\u20090.65). Drug sensitivity analyses further suggested that vandetanib may have the potential to inhibit recurrence by targeting B2M-related pathways. These findings provide evidence that B2M may contribute to remodeling of the immune microenvironment in recurrent HCC. Our integrative single-cell multi-omics approach highlights a possible mechanism of early recurrence and offers a preliminary predictive tool with therapeutic implications.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: KIF18A inhibition: the next big player in the search for cancer therapeutics.. Abstract: Kinesin-like protein 18A (KIF18A) is a member of the kinesin family of molecular motor proteins, which utilise energy from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to regulate critical cellular processes such as chromosome movement and microtubule dynamics. KIF18A plays a vital role in controlling microtubule length, which is crucial for maintaining proper cell function and division. Notably, increased expression levels of KIF18A have been observed in various types of cancer, indicating its potential involvement in tumour progression. Although preclinical studies have demonstrated that KIF18A is not essential for normal somatic cell division, it appears to be crucial for the survival and division of cancer cells, particularly those exhibiting chromosomal instability. This dependency makes KIF18A a promising target for developing new therapeutic strategies aimed at treating chromosomally unstable cancers. This review delves into the structural and functional aspects of KIF18A, and its role in cancer development, and evaluates current and emerging approaches to targeting KIF18A with innovative cancer treatments.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common female malignancies. This study explored the underlying mechanism through which the two plant compounds (Brucaine D and Narclasine) inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of Brucaine D and Narclasine on breast cancer development and their potential drug targets. GSE85871 dataset containing 212 samples and the hallmark gene set \"h.all.v2023.1.Hs.symbols.gmt\" were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) database, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to classify clusters showing similar gene expression pattern. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to calculate the hallmark score for different drug treatment groups. The expressions of genes related to angiogenesis, glycolysis and cell cycle were detected. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was performed to study the interaction of the hub genes. Then, HERB database was employed to identify potential target genes for Narclasine and Bruceine D. Finally, in vitro experiments were conducted to validate partial drug-target pair. PCA analysis showed that the significant changes in gene expression patterns took place in 6 drugs treatment groups (Narciclasine, Bruceine D, Japonicone A, 1beta-hydroxyalatolactone, Britanin, and four mixture drugs) in comparison to the remaining drug treatment groups. The ssGSEA pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that Narciclasine and Bruceine treatments had similar enriched pathways, for instance, suppressed pathways related to angiogenesis, Glycolysis, and cell cycle, etc.. Further gene expression analysis confirmed that Narciclasine and Bruceine had a strong ability to inhibit these cell cycle genes, and that MYC, CHEK2, MELK, CDK4 and EZH2 were closely interacted with each other in the PPI analysis. Drug target prediction revealed that Androgen Receptor (AR) and Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) were the targets for Bruceine D, and Cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) was the target for Narciclasine. Cell experiments also confirmed the connections between Narciclasine and CYP3A4. The present study uncovered that Narciclasine and Bruceine D could inhibit the growth of breast cancer and also predicted the potential targets for these two drugs, providing a new therapeutic direction for breast cancer patients.

Abstract: The treatment of cancer continues to evolve toward personalized therapies based on individual patient and tumor characteristics. Our successes and failures in adopting a precision-oncology approach have demonstrated the utmost importance in identifying the proper predictive biomarkers of response. Until recently, most biomarkers were identified using immunohistochemistry for protein expression or single-gene analysis to identify targetable alterations. With the rapid propagation of next-generation sequencing to evaluate tumor tissue and \"liquid biopsies,\" identification of genomic biomarkers is now standard, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, for which there is now an extensive catalog of biomarker-directed therapies with more anticipated to come. Despite these great strides, it has also become apparent that using genomic biomarkers alone will be insufficient, as it has been consistently shown that at least one-half of patients who undergo tumor genomic profiling have no actionable alteration. This is perhaps to be expected given the remarkable breadth of nongenetic factors that contribute to tumor initiation and progression. Some have proposed that the next logical step is to use transcriptome profiling to define new biomarkers of response to targeted agents. Recently, results from the WINTHER trial were published, specifically investigating the use of transcriptomics to improve match rates over genomic next-generation sequencing alone. In this review, we discuss the complexities of precision-oncology efforts and appraise the available evidence supporting the incorporation of transcriptomic data into the precision-oncology framework in the historical context of the development of biomarkers for directing cancer therapy.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Commentary: Ovarian Cancer: Path to Effective Treatments.. Abstract: Despite advancements in cancer therapeutics such as checkpoint inhibitors and some targeted therapies, we have not achieved success in effectively treating ovarian cancer, since these therapeutics only benefit a subset of patients, and also provide short-term protection. The use of chemotherapy and radiation therapy can cause depletion and/or lack of immune cells' function. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is found to be effective against several blood-based cancers, but limited success was seen against solid tumors. Targeting fewer antigens and significant side effects of therapy decreases the efficacy of CAR-T cells as immunotherapeutic in solid tumors, even though there is a great drive and significant effort to establish these therapies around the world. Bispecific and tri-specific antibodies have recently been advocated as effective cancer therapeutics. However, at present, these also suffer the fate of CAR-Ts since the loss of antigen on tumor cells will render these therapeutics ineffective. At present, we should design therapeutics that may have synergistic effects on killing/treating tumors. The only way we can establish that will be by learning the mechanisms of actions of immune therapeutics. Thus, advancement in the knowledge and effective strategies are required to develop cancer immuno-therapeutics. We have dedicated our efforts to understand the immunobiology of natural killer (NK) cells. One of our most important discoveries was demonstration of targeting of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs)/poorly differentiated tumors exhibiting lower major histocompability complex class I expression by the NK cells. In addition, we showed that supercharged NK (sNK) cells had great ability to target both CSCs/poorly differentiated and well differentiated ovarian tumors, whereas activated primary NK cells only targeted CSCs/poorly differentiated tumors. Therefore, the use of sNK cells in immunotherapy should result in effective elimination of heterogeneous populations of ovarian tumors. Journal: Critical reviews in immunology. Year: 2025.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small, regulatory and non-coding RNA molecules, display aberrant expression patterns and functional abnormalities in all kinds of human diseases including cancers. As important emerging modulators in cellular pathways, miRNAs play a key role in tumorigenesis. Correcting these miRNA deficiencies by either up-regulating or down-regulating miRNA function may provide a therapeutic benefit. We herein provide a brief review of miRNA in the following aspects: their possible role of miRNA as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the pathogenesis of cancer, the abnormally expressed miRNAs in various types of human common cancers, novel drug targets and therapeutic tools for diagnosis, prognosis and treatments of human cancers was also discussed. Finally, we comment on the difficulties and challenges of miRNAs in clinical practice, and the bright perspective for future application. Targeting of these ectopically miRNAs could provide an important diagnostic or therapeutic strategy for human cancer in the future. Journal: Expert opinion on biological therapy. Year: 2012.

Abstract: The discovery of various driver pathways and targeted small molecule agents/antibodies have revolutionized the management of metastatic breast cancer. Currently, the major targets of clinical utility in breast cancer include the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK-4/6) pathway. Brain metastasis, however, remains a thorn in the flesh, leading to morbidity, neuro-cognitive decline, and interruptions in the management of systemic disease. Approximately 20%-30% of patients with metastatic breast cancer develop brain metastases. Surgery, whole brain radiation therapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery are the traditional treatment options for patients with brain metastases. The therapeutic paradigm is changing due to better understanding of the blood brain barrier and the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Several of these agents are in clinical practice and several others are in early stage clinical trials. In this article, we will review the common targetable pathways in the management of breast cancer patients with brain metastases, and the current state of the clinical development of drugs against these pathways.

Abstract: The present study aims to provide outcome data in children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) over two decades and variables that impact survival. This retrospective study included children who were diagnosed with ALL and treated at our center and relapsed between March 2002 and March 2021. A total of 100 children (64 boys, 36 girls) were included; 80 had B-ALL, 20 had T-ALL. 50 children had a very early relapse, while 25 each had an early and late relapse. The site of relapse was bone marrow in 57, isolated central nervous system (CNS) in 10, isolated testicular in 1, and combined bone marrow and CNS relapse in 32 children. Thirty-six families opted for the best supportive care; 23 of these had very early relapse. Among the 35 who were in remission following induction chemotherapy, 32 (91%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); 17/32 (53%) were alive and disease-free. Overall survival (OS) was 19 (19%) with a median follow-up of 23.5 months with a significantly improved survival post-measurable risk of disease (MRD) based risk stratification (4% vs 35%, P = 0.02). The OS with very early, early, and late relapses were 8%, 28%, and 32% (P = 0.018), and 15%, 12.5%, and 50% with bone marrow, combined and isolated CNS relapses (P = 0.008). Relapsed ALL remains a challenge, with OS of 19% and 53% among those who underwent HSCT. Abandonment after relapse continues to be prevalent, and we need to integrate social support for providing care and optimal treatment. Journal: Indian pediatrics. Year: 2024.

Abstract: Predictive biomarkers for oncology are necessary to accurately identify patients who will benefit from anticancer treatment. Recently approved oncology drugs target discrete molecular aberrations or pathways in tumor cells and consequently are active on a subset of patient population, yet clinical studies have shown that not all biomarker-positive patients respond. The advancement of predictive biomarkers needs to detect novel and evolving drug resistance mechanisms, not only to guide the selection of patient subsets for specific treatments, but to identify new therapeutic targets. Going beyond the \"one marker, one drug\" model to incorporate genomics, transcriptomics, and receptor status assessments during biomarker-drug co-development can aid in the successful application of molecular marker-based cancer therapy. This review provides the latest update of biomarker-based cancer therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. We provide case studies of therapeutics selectively targeting HER2, EGFR, or PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathways. We also discuss the challenges and promising future directions in the co-development of targeted cancer therapeutics and paired predictive biomarkers.

Abstract: NWTS-5 was a multi-institutional clinical trial for patients less than 16 years of age at diagnosis with specific renal neoplasms who were diagnosed between August 1, 1995 and May 31, 2002. A uniform approach to the treatment of patients with relapse was employed. Seventy-two patients who relapsed after immediate nephrectomy (stages I and II), initial chemotherapy with vincristine (VCR) and actinomycin D and no radiation therapy were registered on stratum B of the NWTS-5 relapse protocol. Four patients were not evaluable: one due to insufficient data and three due to major protocol violations. Among the 68 remaining patients, one who was 19 years of age at initial diagnosis of Wilms tumor, five with bilateral Wilms tumor at diagnosis, three who developed a contralateral relapse, and one with persistent disease were not included in this analysis. Relapse treatment included surgical excision, when feasible, radiation therapy and alternating courses of VCR, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and etoposide and cyclophosphamide. The outcomes of 58 patients were analyzed. The lung was the only site of relapse for 31 patients. Event-free survival 4 years after relapse was 71.1% and 4-year overall survival was 81.8% for all patients and were 67.8 and 81.0% for those who relapsed only to their lungs. The most frequent toxicities were hematological. These results demonstrate that a significant proportion of children with Wilms tumor who relapse after initial treatment with VCR and actinomycin D can be successfully re-treated.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: The MYC oncogene - the grand orchestrator of cancer growth and immune evasion.. Abstract: The MYC proto-oncogenes encode a family of transcription factors that are among the most commonly activated oncoproteins in human neoplasias. Indeed, MYC aberrations or upregulation of MYC-related pathways by alternate mechanisms occur in the vast majority of cancers. MYC proteins are master regulators of cellular programmes. Thus, cancers with MYC activation elicit many of the hallmarks of cancer required for autonomous neoplastic growth. In preclinical models, MYC inactivation can result in sustained tumour regression, a phenomenon that has been attributed to oncogene addiction. Many therapeutic agents that directly target MYC are under development; however, to date, their clinical efficacy remains to be demonstrated. In the past few years, studies have demonstrated that MYC signalling can enable tumour cells to dysregulate their microenvironment and evade the host immune response. Herein, we discuss how MYC pathways not only dictate cancer cell pathophysiology but also suppress the host immune response against that cancer. We also propose that therapies targeting the MYC pathway will be key to reversing cancerous growth and restoring antitumour immune responses in patients with MYC-driven cancers.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is one of the most common endocrine malignancies, with varying levels of risk and clinical behavior. A better understanding of the molecular characteristics could improve molecular diagnosis and risk assessment. In this study, we performed whole transcriptomic sequencing on 113 PTC cases, including 70 high-risk and 43 low-risk Chinese patients. Comparative transcriptional profiling analysis revealed two functionally distinct patterns of gene dysregulation between the risk subtypes. Low-risk PTCs showed significant upregulation of immune-related genes and increased immune cell infiltration, whereas high-risk PTCs presented extensive alterations in gene expression and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways. Additionally, we developed a 31-gene transcriptomic signature (PTCrisk) for differentiating high-risk from low-risk PTCs, which was validated across both in-house and external multicenter cohorts. PTCrisk scores were positively correlated with key clinicopathological features, including tumor size, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and BRAF mutation status. Overall, our study provides further molecular insights into PTC risk stratification and may contribute to the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for PTC patients.

Abstract: Global gene expression analysis has been a major tool for urothelial carcinoma subtype discovery. This approach has revealed extensive complexity both in intrinsic features of the tumor cells and in the microenvironment. However, global gene expression cannot distinguish between gene expression signals originating from the tumor cells proper and from normal cells in the biopsy. Here, we use a large cohort of advanced urothelial carcinomas for which both gene expression data and extensive immunohistochemistry are available to create a supervised mRNA expression centroid classifier. This classifier identifies the major Lund taxonomy tumor cell phenotypes as defined by IHC. We apply this classifier to the independent TCGA dataset and show excellent associations between identified subtypes and genomic features. We validate a progressed version of Urothelial-like A (UroA-Prog) that shows FGFR3 mutations and CDKN2A deletions, and we show that the variant Urothelial-like C is almost devoid of FGFR3 mutations. We show that Genomically Unstable tumors are very distinct from Urothelial-like tumors at the genomic level, and that tumors classified as Basal/SCC-like all complied with the established definition for Basal/SCC-like tumors. We identify the Mesenchymal-like and Small-cell/Neuroendocrine-like subtypes, and demonstrate that patients with UroB and Sc/NE-like tumors show the worst overall survival.

Despite advancements in therapeutic approaches, FL treatment algorithm and management remain not well-established, necessitating both ongoing research into novel therapeutic strategies and in stating patient journey. We propose a comprehensive overview of current standard treatments for relapsed or refractory (R/R) FL, including chemoimmunotherapy and stem cell transplantation, and insights into emerging therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies. We discuss the efficacy and safety profiles of these innovative treatments, their integration into the therapy armamentarium, and the potential they hold in altering the natural history of FL.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated venetoclax activity in pediatric patient-derived xenograft models and cell lines; however, clinical studies in pediatric patients have yet to be conducted.

Abstract: KRAS mutations are common in pancreatic and colorectal cancers and are associated with lack of response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy. Ras is an established therapeutic target that has long eluded efforts to develop specific inhibitors, while targeting downstream signaling pathways has proven largely ineffective, highlighting a need for rational combination strategies to overcome resistance. Recently, renewed interest in directly targeting Ras has led to the development of several small-molecule inhibitors that bind directly to K-Ras or its effector proteins, downregulation of K-Ras expression using therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides or siRNAs, and targeting scaffold proteins such as kinase suppressor of Ras. Indirect approaches to inhibiting K-Ras include combining inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway with novel targeted agents. Immunotherapy in early studies has also shown clinical promise. This review summarizes the current evidence for each of these approaches. Journal: Critical reviews in oncology/hematology. Year: 2018.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Immune checkpoint targeting antibodies hold promise for combinatorial cancer therapeutics.. Abstract: Through improving the immune system's ability to recognize and combat tumor cells as well as its receptivity to changes in the tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy has emerged as a highly successful addition to the treatment of cancer. However, tumor heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in cancer therapy as it can undermine the anti-tumor immune response through the manipulation of the extracellular matrix. To address these challenges and improve targeted therapies and combination treatments, the food and drug administration has approved several immunomodulatory antibodies to suppress immunological checkpoints. Combinatorial therapies necessitate the identification of multiple targets that regulate the intricate communication between immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, and cellular responses within the tumor microenvironment. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of the ongoing clinical trials involving immunomodulatory antibodies in various cancer types. It explores the potential of these antibodies to modulate the immune system and enhance anti-tumor responses. Additionally, it discusses the perspectives and prospects of immunomodulatory therapeutics in cancer treatment. Although immunotherapy shows great promise in cancer treatment, it is not exempt from side effects that can arise due to hyperactivity of the immune system. Therefore, understanding the intricate balance between immune activation and regulation is crucial for minimizing these adverse effects and optimizing treatment outcomes. This study aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge surrounding immunomodulatory antibodies and their potential as effective therapeutic options in cancer treatment, ultimately paving the way for improved patient outcomes and deepening our perception of the intricate interactivity between the immune system and tumors.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule as a Predictor of Disease-Specific Survival and Patterns of Relapse in Endometrial Cancer.. Abstract: The aim was to study the association of L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) expression with the outcome of patients with endometrial cancer, especially with regard to conventional risk variables, and to compare the patterns of relapse in L1CAM-positive and -negative cancers. This was a retrospective study of 805 women. The Kaplan-Meier method and univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were applied for survival analyses. Missing data were replaced using multiple imputation. The median follow-up time was 51 months (range, 1-98). One hundred twenty-one (15.0%) cases were L1CAM positive. L1CAM positivity was associated with high stage (I vs II-IV) (odds ratio [OR], 2.3), lymph node involvement (OR, 2.9), poor differentiation (OR, 6.1), non-endometrioid histology (OR, 9.9), lymphovascular space invasion (OR, 2.8), cervical stromal invasion (OR, 1.8), positive peritoneal cytology (OR, 4.1), and age older than 65 years (OR, 2.8). The frequencies of deep myometrial invasion (50% or deeper), tumor size 2 cm or greater, and body mass index 30 kg/m or greater were not significantly different between L1CAM-positive and -negative cases. L1CAM predicted poor disease-specific survival in endometrioid (P < 0.0001) but not in non-endometrioid carcinomas (P = 0.934). The negative impact of L1CAM on outcome was confirmed in a Cox multivariate disease-specific survival analysis. Univariate survival analyses in the different ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO endometrial cancer risk groups showed an association between L1CAM positivity and poor outcome in intermediate (hazard ratio, 12) and high-risk advanced metastatic (hazard ratio, 2.0) groups. Extra-abdominal relapses were more frequent in L1CAM-positive (13.2%) than L1CAM-negative (1.9%) stage I endometrioid carcinomas (P < 0.0001), whereas other site-specific relapses in local cancers were L1CAM independent. L1CAM is associated with the occurrence of poor prognostic variables and predicts advanced disease in endometrial cancer. L1CAM predicts extra-abdominal relapses and poor survival in endometrioid endometrial cancer, but seems not to be a prognostic factor in non-endometrioid carcinomas.

Abstract: When a patient with germ cell tumor (GCT) fails to be cured with high dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto- BMT) the overall prognosis is very poor and any further treatment has only palliative character. A question requiring answer is how intense should this kind of treatment be, and what can be expected from it. Of 44 patients with GCT who were transplanted after HDC in our centre between 1999- 2005, 17 experienced treatment failure. Amongst them 14 had marker-positive relapse or confirmed germ cell histology. Another 3 had second primary neoplasms. Of the 17 patients 14 received further treatment that consisted of surgery alone in 2, chemotherapy in 2, radiotherapy in 1, combined surgery + chemotherapy in 5, chemotherapy +surgery + radiotherapy in 3 and chemotherapy + radiotherapy in 1 patient. The median survival from the time of relapse was 3 months in all patients, and 6 months in the 14 patients who received further treatment. In 6 patients with relapse confined to a single site the median survival was 11 months. Three patients in this group are alive with overall survival (OS) of 37.4+, 24.3+ and 6.2+ months (all had multimodal treatment: chemotherapy + surgery or radiotherapy, and all achieved durable complete response/CR). Our results suggest that GCT patients who have relapsed/ progressed after HDC may benefit from further treatment. Best chances for long term survival have those who experience relapse confined to one metastatic site and receive combined treatment (surgery or radiotherapy plus systemic therapy).

Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer lacks an expression of ER, PR, and Her-2, has a poor prognosis, and there are no target therapies available. Therapeutic options to treat TNBC are limited and urgently needed. Strong evidence indicates that molecular signaling pathways have a significant function to regulate biological mechanisms and their abnormal expression endows with the development of cancer. PIM kinase is overexpressed in various human cancers including TNBC which is regulated by various signaling pathways that are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival and also make PIM kinase as an attractive drug target. One of the targets of the STAT3 signaling pathway is PIM1 that plays a key role in tumor progression and transformation. In this review, we accumulate the current scenario of the PIM-STAT3 axis that provides insights into the PIM1 and STAT3 inhibitors which can be developed as potential co-inhibitors as prospective anticancer agents.

Abstract: Single-cell technologies offer insights into molecular feature distributions, but comparing them poses challenges. We propose a kernel-testing framework for non-linear cell-wise distribution comparison, analyzing gene expression and epigenomic modifications. Our method allows feature-wise and global transcriptome/epigenome comparisons, revealing cell population heterogeneities. Using a classifier based on embedding variability, we identify transitions in cell states, overcoming limitations of traditional single-cell analysis. Applied to single-cell ChIP-Seq data, our approach identifies untreated breast cancer cells with an epigenomic profile resembling persister cells. This demonstrates the effectiveness of kernel testing in uncovering subtle population variations that might be missed by other methods. Journal: Genome biology. Year: 2024.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Predicting Functional Modules of Liver Cancer Based on Differential Network Analysis.. Abstract: Complex diseases are generally caused by disorders of biological networks or/and mutations in multiple genes. The efficient and systematic identification of functional modules can not only supply effective diagnosis and treatment in clinic, but also benefit in further in-depth analysis of the pathological mechanism of complex diseases. In this study, we applied the method of differential network to identify functional modules between control and disease samples, which are different from most of the current approaches that focus on differential expression. In particular, we applied our approach to analyze transcriptome data of liver cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://cancergenome.nih.gov/), and we obtained two modules associated with liver cancer. One is a functional gene module that contains a set of liver cancer-related genes, and another is an lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) module that includes liver cancer-related lncRNAs. The results of survival analysis and classification show that the functional modules cannot only be used as effective modular biomarkers to identifying liver cancer, but also predict the prognosis of liver cancer. The method can identify functional modules in genes and lncRNA from liver cancer, and these modules can be used to do prognosis detection and further study in mechanism of liver cancer.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Sex and gender perspectives in colorectal cancer.. Abstract: Historically women were frequently excluded from clinical trials and drug usage to protect unborn babies from potential harm. As a consequence, the impact of sex and gender on both tumour biology and clinical outcomes has been largely underestimated. Although interrelated and often used interchangeably, sex and gender are not equivalent concepts. Sex is a biological attribute that defines species according to their chromosomal makeup and reproductive organ, while gender refers to a chosen sexual identity. Sex dimorphisms are rarely taken into account, in either preclinical or clinical research, with inadequate analysis of differences in outcomes according to sex or gender still widespread, reflecting a gap in our knowledge for a large proportion of the target population. Underestimation of sex-based differences in study design and analyses has invariably led to 'one-drug' treatment regimens for both males and females. For patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), sex also has an impact on the disease incidence, clinicopathological features, therapeutic outcomes, and tolerability to anticancer treatments. Although the global incidence of CRC is higher in male subjects, the proportion of patients presenting right-sided tumours and BRAF mutations is higher among females. Concerning sex-related differences in treatment efficacy and toxicity, drug dosage does not take into account sex-specific differences in pharmacokinetics. Toxicity associated with fluoropyrimidines, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies has been reported to be more extensive for females with CRC than for males, although evidence about differences in efficacy is more controversial. This article aims to provide an overview of the research achieved so far into sex and gender differences in cancer and summarize the growing body of literature illustrating the sex and gender perspective in CRC and their impact in relation to tumour biology and treatment efficacy and toxicity. We propose endorsing research on how biological sex and gender influence CRC as an added value for precision oncology. Journal: ESMO open. Year: 2023.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Molecular Subtypes and the Evolution of Treatment Decisions in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.. Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) has clinically relevant molecular heterogeneity at multiple levels: genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and microenvironment features. Genomic events acquired during carcinogenesis remain drivers of cancer progression in the metastatic setting. For example, KRAS and NRAS mutations define a population refractory to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutations associate with poor outcomes under standard therapies and response to targeted inhibitors in combinations, and HER2 amplifications confer unique sensitivity to double HER2 blockade. Multiple rare gene alterations driving resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies have been described, with substantial overlap in primary and acquired mechanisms, in line with a clonal selection process. In this context, sequential analysis of circulating tumor DNA has the potential to guide drug development in a treatment-refractory setting. Rare kinase fusion events and complex alterations in genes involved in DNA damage repair have been described, with emerging evidence for targetability. On the other hand, transcriptomic subtypes and pathway activation signatures have also shown prognostic and potential predictive value in metastatic CRC. These markers reflect stromal and immune microenvironment interactions with cancer cells. For example, the microsatellite instable or POLE ultramutant CRC population is particularly sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors, whereas tumors with a mesenchymal phenotype are characterized by activation of immunosuppressive molecules that mandate stratified development of novel immunotherapy combinations. Here, we review the expanding landscape of targetable oncogenic alterations and signatures in metastatic CRC and discuss the clinical implementation of novel molecular diagnostic tests.

    "search_text": "PubMed paper: Drug Repurposing in Medulloblastoma: Challenges and Recommendations.. Abstract: Medulloblastoma is the most frequently diagnosed primary malignant brain tumor among children. Currently available therapeutic strategies are based on surgical resection, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. However, majority of patients quickly develop therapeutic resistance and are often left with long-term therapy-related side effects and sequelae. Therefore, there remains a dire need to develop more effective therapeutics to overcome the acquired resistance to currently available therapies. Unfortunately, the process of developing novel anti-neoplastic drugs from bench to bedside is highly time-consuming and very expensive. A wide range of drugs that are already in clinical use for treating non-cancerous diseases might commonly target tumor-associated signaling pathways as well and hence be of interest in treating different cancers. This is referred to as drug repurposing or repositioning. In medulloblastoma, drug repurposing has recently gained a remarkable interest as an alternative therapy to overcome therapy resistance, wherein existing non-tumor drugs are being tested for their potential anti-neoplastic effects outside the scope of their original use.
