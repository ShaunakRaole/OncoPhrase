       " 'abstract': \"Non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are largely classified into lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), which have different therapeutic options according to its molecular profiles and immune checkpoint expression, especially PD-L1, which is a suppressive factor in the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment can be altered by the genomic mutations on specific innate immune genes as well as tumor suppressor genes, so it is essential to comprehend the association between tumor microenvironment and tumor suppressor genes to discover the promising immunotherapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance of immune check point blockade. In this study, we aimed to analyze how the somatic mutations in tumor suppressor genes affect the tumor immune microenvironment through a comprehensive analysis of mutational profiling on the representative tumor suppressor genes (<i>TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, RB1, BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>) and immune gene expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 155 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and 196 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples. Several microenvironmental factors, such as the infiltrating immune and stromal cells, were suppressed by the mutated tumor suppressor genes in LUSC, unlike in the LUAD samples. In particular, infiltrating immune cells such as macrophage, neutrophil, and dendritic cells were significantly reduced in tumors with mutated tumor suppressor genes' group. In addition, the gene expressions for interleukin production and lymphocyte differentiation and <i>PGC, C7, HGF, PLA2G2A, IL1RL1, CCR2, ALOX15B, CXCL11, FCN3</i> were significantly down-regulated, which were key immune genes for the cross-talk between LUSC microenvironment and tumor suppressors. Therefore, we generated evidence that TSG mutations in LUSC have an impact on tumor immune microenvironment, which suggests that TSG non-mutated patients will have the more inflamed tumors and are more likely to respond to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.\",\n",
